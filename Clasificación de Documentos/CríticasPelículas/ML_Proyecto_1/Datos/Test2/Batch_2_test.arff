'clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another . \nmidnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn\'t even in , and it\'s damn good . \nadapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head . \nand that\'s just the mayor . \nas director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor . \nlike all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion . \nthe acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you\'d expect , but it\'s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm . \ncusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey\'s parties . \nlots of food , beverages and gunplay . \nyes , an employee of spacey\'s has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead . \nit seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there\'s much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in . \nthe weird circle of entertainment . \nthis is where the stable of supporting characters comes in . \nthere\'s the requisite sexy woman ( alison \" nepotist\'s daughter \" eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite . \nmiss chablis deserves a paragraph of his/her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ? \nchablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie\'s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie . \nthere are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating . \ncertainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey\'s lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury\'s foreman . \nit\'s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey\'s homosexuality . \nyes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course . \nmidnight in the garden of good and evil isn\'t a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity-directed , true-story best-seller adaptations out there . \nlikewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great . \nin fact , i\'d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category . \nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \n',1
' \" you\'ll go ape over tarzan because it\'s more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! \" \nokay , there\'s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . \ndisney\'s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . \nfather , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . \nit\'s amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . \nbefore you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . \nagainst the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . \ntarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . \nmuch of tarzan\'s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his \" father , \" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . \nall he\'s looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . \nwhen you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . \nlook back on past disney animated features and you\'ll see the trend . \ngrowing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . \none is an ape named terk ( rosie o\'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nboth provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . \ni\'m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . \njust fill in the blanks ! \ncan you see it ? \n \" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \nwe\'ve already had a fish and a crab , and we\'ve had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ? \nwell , there we go ! \" \nof course , there\'s gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . \ntogether with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . \nshe discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory \" you tarzan , me jane \" scene . \nthankfully , those aren\'t the exact words . \nhowever , i found it distracting that tarzan is going \" ohh ohh ee ee \" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . \nhow does he tell his name to another ape ? \n \" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" \nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \nbut hey , tarzan\'s a young adult . \ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \nisn\'t that illegal in most countries ? \noh , well . \ni don\'t think disney will be using my quote anymore . \ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \nthere\'s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \nthis isn\'t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it\'s just different . \ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn\'t just tarzan , it\'s \" extreme tarzan . \" \nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \nlasting but a few seconds at most , it\'s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o\'donnell . \ngoing into the film , i didn\'t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that\'s no boy ape , that rosie o\'donnell . \" \ndistracting to say the least . \ni\'ll admit i\'ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn\'t tell you how true this film stays to the book . \nbut unless you\'re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \nthis time , i\'ll just say that i went to mcdonald\'s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \n\'nuff said . \n',1
'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\'s independence day is here ! \nit\'s title : starship troopers . \nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \ni realize that i gave last year\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \nas a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . \nin fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . \nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \'star wars\' of the 90s . \" \nam i being to generous to this film ? \nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick-the-aliens\'-asses \" style . \nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \nthis new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \nand they should be . \ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \nthis is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . \nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \nstating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , \nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \nhowever , carmen isn\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \nunfortunately , rico isn\'t interested in dizzy . \nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . \ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . \nand as a result , dizzy signs up . \neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . \nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . \nin reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . \nan hour into the film , the war begins . \na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . \nthe first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\' attacks . \na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \nthe troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . \ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \nit\'s about special effects and gory violence . \ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\'s event horizon . \nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \nmy guess is that verhoeven\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \njake busey , gary busey\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \nhowever , he does give a good performance . \nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \nhis performance rises above the rest . \nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\'s presence on screen . \nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \nwe aren\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \ni haven\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \noh , and the special effects are first rate . \nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \nbelieve me when i say this : don\'t take young kids to see this film . \nit is extremely violent . \nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \nit\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . \nnow that would be entertaining ! \n',1
'renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . \nthe film follows potter\'s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . \nhe also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as \" the umbrellas of cherbourg \" and \" the young girls of rochefort . \" \nthe tale has resnais\'s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . \nit is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone\'s heart for every occasion . \nwhat hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . \nyet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . \nalso , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . \nit also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . \nit tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . \nthey are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . \nshe is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . \nshe once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . \nsimon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . \nsimon\'s boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . \nscreenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . \njaoui\'s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . \nin history , using for her thesis the study of \'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . \' \nshe works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control . \non her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . \nto his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister\'s new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he\'s so sensitive . \nbacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . \nhe is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . \nodile still pines for him , but he\'s married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . \nlove is \'the same old song\' that makes the world go \'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . \neverything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile\'s place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . \nthere\'s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . \nthis film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . \nit not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . \nit is also interesting in the way it examines its characters\' behavior as being similar in business as in love . \n',1
'director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films . \nyou need look no further than die hard ( he was director of photography ) , speed and last years twister for examples of his hi- octane , edge of your seat thrill prowess . \nspeed 2 is no exception . \nthis time , the action takes place on a huge cruise liner , on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship . \nyep , that\'s right , no keanu reeves this time , but fear not , jason patrick is more than up to the job . \nspeaking of which , the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist , willem dafoe , from crashing the liner into a huge island , after stealing a diamond collection . \nthe reason for this act of destruction is revenge . \nafter years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers , he contracts copper poisoning and is retired . \nnaturally , what entails next is a lot of running/jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day . \nthinking back on this film , you can\'t help , but admire it\'s structure . \nthe way , willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers . \nthe race against time to save the liner from crashing , and of course , the finale chase scence . \n ( although this is ruined by an over the top , one too many stunt and explosion . ) \nsimple in construction , effective in it\'s execution , and the result , a clear and concise , highly enjoyable action film . \nthe acting is adequate , although it\'s darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a \'hot totty\' appeal to the men ( and she does that perfectly ! ) , jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist . \noverall , speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride . \nnot up to it\'s predecessor\'s high calibre but very good all the same . \nthere is plenty going on , some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie . \n',1
'errol morris , critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast , cheap and out of control , vaults to new heights with mr . \ndeath . \nthis film , an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a . leuchter , jr . , is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise , stunning even the more jaded minds among us . \ndon\'t let the film\'s cheesy dissuade you . \nfollowing this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter\'s life and mind . \nmorris follows the trail of leuchter\'s madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up . \nvirtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials . \nafter a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo-nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory\' that the holocaust never happened . \nmorris\'s interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves . \nzundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch . \nleuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial . \npart of this effect may be due to morris\'s new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer . \nthis was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling . \ncombine the irony of these interviews with leuchter\'s reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you\'ve got one compelling and disturbing documentary . \nwhile this film isn\'t for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape . \naside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience . \n',1
'let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn\'t looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . \ni\'m not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . \ni\'m happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . \nby that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . \nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren\'t exactly a pleasant experience . \nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . \nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . \ni guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . \nanyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . \ni think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . \nthere were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . \nand bond\'s last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . \nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . \neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . \nfor the most part , the action sequences worked very well . \nalthough , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . \ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . \nwhile he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . \nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . \nhe almost seemed like he didn\'t know what he was doing . \nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn\'t take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . \nif you have ever seen a bond film , you won\'t be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . \nthe world is not enough is no exception . \nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . \n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . \nwhy this point is included is beyond me . \nthey took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . \nanyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . \ni guess world domination just isn\'t as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . \nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline\'s owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard\'s recent victims . \nalong the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . \nlike all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . \nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . \nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . \nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau\'s character . \nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . \nlater , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . \nbut because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . \nafter all , it isn\'t shakespeare . \nhow about the cast ? \nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . \ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . \njudi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . \nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . \nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . \ncoltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . \nthen there are the bond girls . \nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . \nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . \nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . \nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . \nthen we have denise richards . \nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . \nand after you see the outfits she wears , you won\'t have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer\'s eyes . \ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . \nadmittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle\'s character . \nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . \nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . \ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . \nthis might have worked well in another movie , but i don\'t go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . \nlast , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond\'s gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . \nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . \nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . \nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power . \nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . \nwhile we don\'t see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn\'s legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . \nso how does it stack up ? \ndespite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . \nand , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . \nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films . \nit may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . \none thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . \nhere\'s looking forward to bond number 20 . \n',1
'what\'s shocking about \" carlito\'s way \" is how good it is . \nhaving gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino\'s previous film , \" scent of a woman , \" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , \" carlito\'s way \" was destined for underrated heaven . \nthat\'s what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . \nand what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . \n \" carlito\'s way \" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . \nof course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he\'s really a crook at heart . \ncarlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can\'t escape into something he is not . \ncarlito\'s attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . \nwhen he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . \nhe\'s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he\'s doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . \ncarlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that\'s where it\'s at ) , but needs some funding . \nbeing a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . \nand the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . \nhe gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he\'s constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco \" from the bronx \" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . \non the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . \nshe\'s a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . \nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . \nall of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . \nwhen i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . \nsure , it\'s going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . \nwhat\'s amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . \nlike \" apollo 13 , \" we know what\'s going to happen , but we\'re still thrilled by what happens in the middle . \nit\'s also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . \nde palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . \nhis earlier flim , \" scarface \" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i\'m still not over ) . \nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . \nto me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . \nthis is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . \nwith a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito\'s head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino\'s face , it\'s a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . \nthe acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . \npacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn\'t puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn\'t as \" strong \" as his oscar-winning role in \" scent of a woman . \" \nwell , his \" scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a \" foghorn leghorn impression . \" \nin \" carlito\'s way , \" he\'s emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he\'s remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . \ni felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" \nas i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . \nand they\'re scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . \nand sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . \nevery scene he\'s in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . \nin smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \n \" carlito\'s way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you\'re absolutely blown away . \nit\'s a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn\'t do so hot . \nbut trust me and check it out . \nit\'s a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right . \n',1
'how many of us would become strippers ? \nfor those of us who wouldn\'t , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? \nthat\'s probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . \nas you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . \nwould you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? \nin case you haven\'t guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain\'t . \nit\'s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . \nit is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . \nwhat to do ? \nit hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . \nit seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . \neventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . \nthese include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . \nwhen the sextet is complete , we\'re given a hefty dose of physical comedy . \nwe watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . \nas if there anti-appeal wasn\'t enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising \" the full monty \" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . \n . \n . \nand i mean * all * . \nthe movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . \nit\'s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . \nwith the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . \nthe amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . \nthere\'s a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn\'t be better . \neach character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . \nthe full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could\'ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness . \nit\'s one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . \neither way you see it , it shouldn\'t let you down in the slightest . \nand , pun heavily intended , when it\'s all said and done , you\'ll be smiling from cheek to cheek . \n',1
'of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . \nthink about it . \nfrankenstein movies haven\'t changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . \nif you made a frankenstein movie today , you\'d have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren\'t any actors that could play a virus convincingly . \nmovies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . \nthere\'s not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . \n ( and there\'s that michael j . fox thing again . ) \nbut you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . \nyou can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker\'s dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . \nyou can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . \nwere it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . \nany day now , i expect we\'ll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . \nor , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . \nwesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . \nin this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . \nsnipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . \nblade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . \nhe is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets . \nyet , he\'s not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . \nlike any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . \nfor some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver . \n ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) \nunfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . \nthe replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn\'t review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn\'t remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat\'s performance . \nblade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it\'s the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . \nwith a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . \nas it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying . \n',1
'there\'s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . \ngeorge lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . \nreturn of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . \nthe dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . \ninstead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . \neven darth vader doesn\'t seem very intimidating this time around . \nwith the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . \nreturn of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . \nluke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke\'s home planet of tatooine . \ntheir goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . \nit is at jabba\'s home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . \nfrom a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba\'s sand barge , the effects are top notch . \nas soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it\'s back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire\'s newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . \nso , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . \nthere , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . \nreturn of the jedi has some interesting elements . \nthe scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . \nfrom a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . \nnot only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . \non one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . \nin the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . \nthe acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . \nby now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . \nthe chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . \nas in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . \nnewcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he\'s not as imposing as vader was in star wars . \nalthough it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . \nwith the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader\'s incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . \ncongratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . \n , \n',1
'as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan\'s latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \nonce again , chan\'s screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star\'s character simply jackie , with no last name . \nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter\'s ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy\'s existence are chan\'s comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan\'s , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop\'s thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx\'s daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film\'s end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan\'s athletic prowess ) . \nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan\'s latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980\'s the big brawl and 1985\'s the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \n',1
'this remake of \" la cage aux folles \" features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son\'s future in-laws . \nthe couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical , gays possible . \nwilliams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star . \nthey live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode . \nwilliams is excellent as should be no surprise . \ngene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles . \nthe real star is lane . \nhis attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious . \nperhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it . \nluckily ( for me at least ) , it doesn\'t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception . \nthe question of stereotypes is a touchy one . \nthese guys personify the homophobic gay image . \nyou can almost hear the swishing . \nif you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world , you\'ll be outraged . \nbut if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals , you\'ll love it . \nyour choice . \n',1
'it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . \nwilde\'s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . \nthe glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . \nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . \nand that\'s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . \nit\'s been said that todd haynes\' \" velvet goldmine , \" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from \" citizen kane , \" and that\'s true . \nin the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . \nstructure-wise , this totally steals from \" kane , \" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . \nthis is no \" kane , \" and it really doesn\'t aspire to be : it doesn\'t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like \" kane \" did , and it doesn\'t really uncover anything poignant about humanity . \ninstead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . \nthe 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . \nbut the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . \nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that\'s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . \ninstead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you\'ve experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . \nthere\'s no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . \nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . \nblade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . \nthrough discussions with slade\'s ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . \nhaynes demonstrates that he\'s quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , \" baby\'s on fire , \" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film\'s most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . \neven the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie\'s , have a rare visual flair that\'s pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . \nthe best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . \nin it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . \nwith brian eno\'s famous \" needle in the camel\'s eye \" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn\'t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . \nit has a distance that\'s hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . \nthis movie\'s not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being \" style over substance , \" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . \nhowever , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . \nthe music is especially notable . \nthe soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade\'s band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . \nthe cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . \nalthough eddie izzard , as slade\'s manager ( who challenges slade\'s first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . \nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . \nrhys meyers\' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . \nin fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . \nbale\'s character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he\'s not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a \" poof \" ) never help us communicate with him . \nnevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . \nat the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . \ntheir story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . \nthe story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he\'s the everyman , and when you can\'t totally identify with the everyman , your story\'s in slight trouble . \nas a cultural rock piece , \" velvet goldmine \" is rather good , but it is merely good . \nit never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . \nit\'s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . \nthe beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . \nand did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? \nit almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . \nstill , it does what the oliver stone pic \" the doors \" didn\'t do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : \" live life , but after you\'ve lived it , what else is the point when you\'ll be forced to live with regretful memories ? \" ) . \nthe really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down . \n',1
'frequency n . , \nthe number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable ? etc \ndon\'t worry . \nwhen watching the thriller frequency , you won\'t have to know what the heck frequency means . \nthe premise , although it may sound complex , is very basic on the big screen . \na new york cop , john , ( jim caviezel ) finds a radio in his house , which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father , frank , ( dennis quaid ) who died thirty years ago . \nimmediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse . \nwhen frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn\'t supposed to , the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past , they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john\'s mother and nine other women . \nit is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place . \n ( i told you that wasn\'t confusing ? ) . \noverall , i was very pleased with frequency . \nit\'s occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes . \ni usually don\'t buy those cheesy \" i love you dad \" segments in movies , but this one surprisingly satisfied me . \nmaybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative . \nfrequency\'s creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended , what if ? \nwhat would i do ? \nwould i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated ? \nor stop some kids from shooting other kids ? \nor buy stock from yahoo ! ? \n ( a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences ) . \nfrequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future . \nboth share that \" change the past slightly , and you\'ll change the future heavily \" warning . \nthe changes between the present and the past , such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs , are very similar . \nboth are also wonderful feel-good family films that can attract to a number of generations . \nthe only difference worth noting is that frequency\'s final scene doesn\'t set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making . \nthere are some problems with the film though . \nfirst , there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting ( email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is ) . \nthe plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently ( no pun intended ) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story . \nanother problem is that the supporting cast , including noah emmerich and andre braugher , are underused . \nwhile in the film , which is not enough , the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in . \nfrequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end . \neven if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you , like it almost did for me , check this movie out . \nyou may be surprised as well . \n',1
'every year , hollywood crowns a new \" it boy \" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom . \ninheriting the mantle from last year\'s \" winner , \" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham\'s the rainmaker and good will hunting . \ndamon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola\'s take on the rainmaker . \ndamon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \nwhile rudy\'s ( and the film\'s ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \nwritten for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \ncoppola\'s most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy\'s unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company\'s hotshot attorney ) . \nthe inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \nthen , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy\'s often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \nas good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \ndamon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \nin an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \ngood will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon\'s intelligent script touches . \neven though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will\'s burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \nthe material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \nwilliams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will\'s best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will\'s harvard-schooled love interest . \nthe clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will\'s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \nso many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham\'s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \n',1
'tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . \nif i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . \nwhen that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : \" literary . \" \nwhat\'s eating gilbert grape ? \nis such a film . \nit\'s a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . \ngilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . \nas the man of the house since his father\'s suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . \nhe also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . \ngilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . \nas he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . \nslowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges\' screenplay , based on his own novel . \nendora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . \nthe midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . \nminor characters , like crispin glover as the town\'s mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen\'s desperately unhappy housewife . \none of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . \nnot a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . \nthe same can be said of the character of gilbert . \nit\'s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert\'s description of his father with , \" i knew someone like that once . \" \ngilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . \nin one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . \nhis entire life seems to be mocked by arnie\'s repeated chants of , \" we\'re not going anywhere , \" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father\'s footsteps in this regard . \njohnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . \ndepp\'s performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio\'s astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . \nhe puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . \ndicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . \ndarlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert\'s tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert\'s sisters . \nonly juliette lewis doesn\'t quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . \ngilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . \nthanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . \n',1
'blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood\'s premier leading men . \nblade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . \nit is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . \nalthough , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . \nthe ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . \nbut at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . \nthat really doesn\'t take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . \nblade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . \nhis mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . \nincluding a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . \nblade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . \nbut this isn\'t as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade\'s world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . \nthe government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . \nwhere do vampires get money ? \nwell , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . \ni personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . \nblade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . \nhe isn\'t content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . \nhe has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . \nit\'s up to blade to see that this doesn\'t transpire . \nadmittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . \nthe story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . \nthe acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . \nthis isn\'t a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . \nthe movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . \nit\'s a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . \nblade\'s production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . \nalthough , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . \nblade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . \nthis is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . \nwhat blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . \nvery cool . \n',1

'imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes . \nso far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere . \nit is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it\'s throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . \nit is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn\'t bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it\'s finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . \nthe plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988\'s the vanishing . \nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . \nwhen they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department . \nminutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops . \njeff cannot detect the car\'s problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j . \nt walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner . \nit is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor . \njeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight . \ndisconcerted , the coffee shop\'s bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . \nthere , trouble arises . \nand i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what\'s head . \nthere are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam . \nit is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . \nkurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn\'t overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . \nso you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . \nsuffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . \nnot many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . \nas an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \nfaced with an enigma about his wife\'s whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \nwhat\'s most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn\'t rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \nthe villains in the movie aren\'t your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today\'s movies . \nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience\'s fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man\'s biggest fears

'close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea\'s gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness . \na lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols . \nan acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess\' \" a clockwork orange . \" \na voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of \" delicatessen , \" or \" the tin drum . \" \nimagine all of that , and you\'ll get a good sense of what you can expect from \" the butcher boy . \" \nimagine that and more . \nneil jordan\'s latest film \" stars \" rea in more ways than one . \nrea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan\'s \" the crying game , \" contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s . \nbut it\'s his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady\'s son , francis , that makes rea\'s \" performance \" worth watching , worth listening to . \nand that\'s only half the fun . \nplaying the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation . \nfor as much as rea\'s voiceover permeates almost every scene of \" the butcher boy , \" owens commands virtually every frame . \nit\'s impossible to take your eyes off him . \nwith his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . \nin fact , everything was ok until \" the nugent \" came to town . \nnow , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( \" the butcher boy \" is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) . \n \" pigs ! \" screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie . \n \" you\'re all pigs ! \" \nit\'s the start of many a related image . \nafter ma brady is shipped off to the \" garage \" for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many , francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters . \nsquealing like a stuck pig , francie does \" the likes o\' that \" on the nugent\'s living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for \" boney arsed bogmen , \" where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over . \ndirector jordan\'s vivid treatment of pat mccabe\'s nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad o\'connor playing the virgin mary ) . \nit\'s not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior . \nit\'s bleak and it\'s black but it\'s fundamentally very funny . \nrea talks us through it , beautifully , and owens drags us though it , admirably , and , in tandem with jordan\'s sure hand , theirs are contributions to make \" the butcher boy \" a film worth savoring . \n',1
'ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . \nfor his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . \ndespite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . \nthe film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . \nas the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . \nmeanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . \nlucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . \nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \nthat day doesn\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \noscar and lucinda isn\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \non more than one occasion , it\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\'t go anywhere . \nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \nthematically , the film is also strong . \nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \noscar and lucinda don\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \nthere\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \n',1
'will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \nfor a movie character , that\'s usually a death sentence . \nit\'s a trait associated with what my brother calls \" too good for this world \" movies , like phenomenon or powder . \nforgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn\'t die . \nthis is no formula movie . \nin fact , it\'s quite fresh and original . \nit\'s a character study more than anything , and that\'s not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \nwill works whatever kind of job he can get . \nfirst he\'s a janitor , then he works construction . \noff-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \non-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \nlambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \nhaving confirmed he\'s not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \nhe is firmly rejected . \nfinally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \nlambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \nwill ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \nlambeau treats will like a son . \nhe\'s proud of , and amazed by , will\'s accomplishments in mathematics . \nhe encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \nwill isn\'t really interested in academia . \nhe knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \nhe would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau\'s heart . \nmeanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \nit\'s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau\'s \" a \" list . \nwill has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \nshrink after shrink refuses to return after will\'s mockery . \nlambeau\'s last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \nknowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \ntrue to form , will finds sean\'s emotional weakness and attacks . \nbut unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \nlike a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \nlike the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \nrobin williams is excellent in this role . \nhe\'s not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \nin this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \nwilliams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \ni have compared will to a foster child and that\'s not entirely fair . \nemotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \nhe has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \nsean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn\'t start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \nhis exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \nif i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \nit\'s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \nit is emotionally engaging , but it\'s not quite larger than life . \nthis isn\'t a problem per se , but at times i didn\'t know quite how to take it . \nbut this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \na good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \nit doesn\'t just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \ngood will hunting has all three . \nif you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . \n',1
'capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . \njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . \nit lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . \nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . \ni had a good time . \n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nhere goes my credibility . \nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . \ni liked the third jurassic park film . \ni even liked the second jurassic park film . \nin a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton\'s novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle\'s novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . \njp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who\'s half man or the man who\'s half boy . \" \nthat is what all the jurassic park films are . \nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . \nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon\'s mines had under-written characters also . \njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . \nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . \nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . \nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . \ni feel i got my money\'s worth . \nthe story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . \nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . \nthey hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island\'s dinosaurs from a safe height . \nthe height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . \nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . \nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . \nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . \nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . \ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . \nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . \nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . \nright . \nguess what happens next ? \njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \nit has a crocodile\'s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams\'s score for the first film . \njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n',1
'`run lola run\' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . \nfor a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . \nlola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . \nbut , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day\' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . \nin these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola\'s journey , the future can be seriously altered . \n`run lola run\' is an experience like `fight club\' or `the matrix\' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . \nin addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . \n`lola\' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go . \ntykwer\'s world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola\'s fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . \nwith it\'s visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run\' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . \neven more so when considering the fact it\'s all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . \nas a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . \nher exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . \nmeanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . \nboth actors perform beyond the call of duty . \nthe dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . \nthe other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . \nadditional stars that couldn\'t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film\'s eye-catching visual elegance . \n`run lola run\' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . \nthis is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . \nthe other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . \nmost are just chess pieces in tykwer\'s elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . \nbut , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . \na few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . \nmost people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . \nperhaps `run lola run\' will recharge their batteries . \nnot only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . \nlike how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run\' is exhausting . \n',1
'alchemy is steeped in shades of blue . \nkieslowski\'s blue , that is . \nwith its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers\' new independent film echoes the polish director\'s internationally-acclaimed 1993 release . \nlanguage aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character\'s world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm\'s length . \nas a result , while we\'re able to appreciate the film\'s intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant . \nalchemy is divided into three chapters : \" charity \" , \" faith \" , and \" hope \" . \nwhile there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) . \nwhen the film opens , she\'s living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her . \nfollowing his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa\'s life is thrown into turmoil . \nevents swirls around her , and she can\'t find a source of stability . \nin her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend\'s mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a \" back-to- nature \" cult . \nalchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues . \nin addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art . \ndoes personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? \nare artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? \nmyers\' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context . \nthrough louisa\'s struggles , she succeeds . \nwhile alchemy isn\'t always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination . \neven when we\'re not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there\'s enough material on-screen to hold our attention . \nthe cinematography is stunning . \ncity scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film\'s early portions . \nlater , when louisa reaches the \" wilderness \" , we\'re treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground . \nit\'s a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa\'s life as she travels the road back to emotional stability . \nthe title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use \" alchemy \" to provide for the needs of the body and soul . \nand , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it\'s ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace . \nher pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life\'s ultimate goal . \neven though louisa\'s final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it\'s still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch . \nalchemy isn\'t pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it\'s close . \n',1
'titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i\'ve seen all year . \nand believe me , i\'m not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the \" big summer releases \" were dead in the water . \nthank god this film got delayed until december . \nit\'s my christmas present . \ntitanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film . \nwhile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it\'s gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time . \nas a friend of mine , who\'s a true titanic-buff , said \" if someone doesn\'t like this film , it\'s because they didn\'t want to . \" \ntruer words are hard to come by . \nof course , it doesn\'t hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time . \nif you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ? \nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . \nand to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . \nit\'s obvious he truly loves titanic . \nthe film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton\'s character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . \ntheir search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . \nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . \nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . \nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . \nrose\'s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn\'t want to marry . \nher mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . \nthey are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . \nmeanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . \nthey are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . \nfor them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . \nfor rose , she is sailing to her doom . \nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . \nit\'s the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . \nbut as i said above , the love portion isn\'t sappy and doesn\'t \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said . \nit\'s sweet , and it didn\'t make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . \nof course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . \nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . \nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . \nof course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . \nthe sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . \nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . \nthe best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . \nthe crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose\'s story , now are totally aborbed by her . \nrose goes out onto the ship\'s ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . \nwe then see a dream of rose\'s , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . \nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . \nhowever , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . \nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com . \n',1
'the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form . \nit\'s been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre . \nwhat makes \" peter\'s friends \" so remarkable is not how it doesn\'t follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn\'t mind hanging with . \nwhat are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? \nwell . . . . \n1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . \n2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . \n3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart . \n4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . \n5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic . \n6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they\'re friends . \n7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . \n8 . eightly , they\'re all unhappy or marginally so . \n9 . there\'s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that\'s built up over the years . \n10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . \n11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song . \nsince it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a \" british \'big chill . \' \" \nand in some ways it is . \nboth follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships . \nbut while \" the big chill \" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , \" peter\'s friends \" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . \nthe friends of peter\'s were all in the same theatre group back in \'82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . \nafter peter\'s ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . \nnot sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . \nof course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . \nandrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who\'s unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) . \nmaggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . \nroger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in \" sense and sensibility \" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . \nand sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who\'s married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . \nas for peter , things seem okay . . . \nthe film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i\'ve done lots of theatre myself ) . \nand there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . \nthe final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . \nmaybe it\'s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . \nthat\'s really what makes \" peter\'s friends \" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone\'s in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . \nit\'s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . \nnot to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . \nthere are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears \" everybody wants to rule the world , \" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i\'d put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old \" come on eileen \" ) , but this is the british 80s we\'re talking about . \noh well . \nbut anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . \nbranagh\'s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he\'s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . \nthe writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , \" no , but we have hollywood \" - punishment like that ) . \nthe actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter\'s mansion . \na little note should be made about hugh laurie\'s performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i\'ve never seen him actually act this dramatically . \n \" peter\'s friends \" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don\'t know what kind i\'ll have ( like most people , i don\'t look forward to my high school reunion ) . \nbecause of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that . \n',1
'this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven . \nhe has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers . \nall of his movies have one main thing in common- they don\'t skimp on the violence . \nin a verhoeven movie a guy doesn\'t get shot once in the chest- he gets shot many times all over the body . \nrobocop takes place in detroit in the future . \nthings are pretty bleak . \nthe company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force . \npeter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen . \npeter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed . \nmeanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter . \nsomeone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after . \nthe plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace . \nit drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting . \nthe acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop . \nnancy allen does a decent job . \nthis movie doesn\'t leave itself open for a sequel exactly . \nbut they made one anyway . \nenter . . . \nrobocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner \ndetroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film . \nocp is trying to develop an improved \'robocop 2\' that will be more than a match for criminals . \nmost of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city . \nthis film is pretty bizaare . \nit has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor . \nthe plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so . \nthere are three or four plot lines weaving around that don\'t really match up . \nthe effects are still decent though . \nthis sequel isn\'t more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals . \nif you liked the first one , watch this . \nbut be dissapointed . \nso later comes . . . \nrobocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke \nocp is now owned by a large japanese company . \nrobocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire , i mean ocp . \nthe japanese send a cyborg-ninja to deal with robocop . \namong other things . . . \nthis movie is easier to follow than the last one . \nwhich means the plot isn\'t quite as crowded . \nthis movie isn\'t anything special though . \njust more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid-friendly way . \nreally not reccomended . \n',1
'jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . \neven though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . \nthis is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . \nto say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk \'til dawn . \nhe was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . \n ( i\'m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) \ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director\'s helm . \nnearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . \nthe film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . \njackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . \nthis makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . \nhowever , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . \njackie didn\'t know they were in the package with the cash , but that\'s of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . \nof course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . \nordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . \nsure enough , ordell shows up at jackie\'s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she \" borrows \" max\'s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . \ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol\'s chamber to ordell\'s head , jackie proposes a deal . \nsince ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell\'s half million dollars . \nwith a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? \nby itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . \nhowever , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . \njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she\'s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . \nthe film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . \ninstead , it\'s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today\'s movies . \nat least this film has a little imagination . \nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par . \npam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . \nsamuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . \nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . \nnever mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy\'s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . \nhe\'s just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn\'t occur to us , even when we\'re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . \nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell\'s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . \nunfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . \nin this film , he\'s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , \" little bit , \" and \" pretty much . \" \nfonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . \nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . \nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . \ndon\'t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . \nthere\'s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he\'s not really sure what\'s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what\'s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . \nwe look at the screen and think , \" gee , that\'s clever , \" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . \nalthough tarantino isn\'t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . \nthere are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . \nthis is a tribute to both direction and acting . \nhowever , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . \nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she\'s looking for , but instead hoping she\'ll just stop . \noverall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . \nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it\'s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . \nin fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these \" offensive \" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . \ngo see the film and see what i mean . \n',1
'after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel\'s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . \nmuriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . \nshe is often the target of her father\'s frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . \nher self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . \nafter her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel\'s wedding unfolds from there . \ntoni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . \ncollette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . \nshe has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . \ncollette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . \nmuriel\'s father , bill \" the battler \" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . \nwhile chumming around with young fans and crowing \'you can\'t beat progress\' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . \nrachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel\'s cheeky new friend in the film . \nshe has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . \nmuriel\'s tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan\'s scripting \nmuriel\'s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . \nhogan\'s use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . \nhogan\'s script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel\'s earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . \nthe glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . \nmuriel\'s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . \non my four star scale , i give muriel\'s wedding three stars . \n',1
'the central focus of michael winterbottom\'s \" welcome to sarajevo \" is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there . \nit proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( \" platoon \" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible \" the walking dead \" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( \" schindler\'s list \" ) . \nthe two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false . \nthe question is not what went right . \nthe question is what went wrong . \nfor one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that\'s about it . ) . \nthe assortment of high-profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter \" into \" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children\'s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive . \nthe interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison . \nstill , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music . \nand it\'s a plus , because he doesn\'t toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness . \nhe wants us to know that in war , no one is victorious . \nthe sweet hereafter \nstarring ian holm , sarah polley , bruce greenwood , tom mccamus , gabrielle rose , arsinee khanjian , alberta watson , maury chaykin , caerthan banks . \nproduced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg . \nscript by atom egoyan ( based on the novel by russell banks ) . \ndirected by atom egoyan . \nrunning time : 110 mins . \nrated r . __________________________________________________________ \natom egoyan\'s powerfully meditative \" the sweet hereafter \" is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i\'ve seen this year . \nit not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety , with cold , and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected . \nian holm as the somber , lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople , has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers , he\'s a lion for the wrong reasons : the pain for having lost his daughter ( she\'s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money ) is reflected on the town . \nand in some mesmerizing flashbacks , we witness how she lost her purity . \nit\'s one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i\'ve ever seen . \nbut the most astounding part goes to sarah polly , the peaceful , benevolent girl who , in contrast to the other characters , remains the most mentally stable during past , present or future . \nher ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite , yet near-revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for \" breaking the waves \" . \nboth women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see , truly feel , their wordless , omnipotent love . \n \" the sweet hereafter \" though , is atom egoyan\'s movie and as of now , he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema . \nafter surging to worldwide recognition with 1994\'s \" exotica \" , \" the sweet hereafter \" makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves : an artist . \nhe interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common . \n',1
' \" rebel without a cause \" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . \neveryone feels that they are different in some way , that they don\'t belong in some places and \" rebel without a cause \" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . \nno matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . \nthis is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . \nin our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean\'s jim stark does . \nnot only does \" rebel without a cause \" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . \neach generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . \nthis is because times change and in response people change . \nno matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . \nthis is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . \neven if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . \nin one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . \nthey use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . \nthis scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . \nspeaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . \nthe only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same \ngoes for brando , redford , even deniro . \ni can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . \nwill dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? \nany film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . \neven if \" rebel without a cause \" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . \nthe acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . \nnow , however , the coolness is fading . . . \n',1
'the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \nafter seeing luc besson\'s ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson\'s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren\'t equally as interesting , and are they ever . \nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna\'s pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \ngaulthier\'s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson\'s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \nwhile besson\'s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \nat first this character\'s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra\'s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \nthe story\'s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker\'s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . \nit is a fascinating example of how of one artist\'s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . \n',1
'good films are hard to find these days . \ngreat films are beyond rare . \nproof of life , russell crowe\'s one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe\'s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan\'s character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \ni haven\'t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah\'s masterpiece , the getaway . \nbut enough with the gossip , let\'s get to the review . \nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \nwith no choice available to her , bowman\'s wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil\'s advocate and dolores claiborne . \nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe\'s right hand gun while providing most of the film\'s humor . \nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story\'s characters . \nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \nproof of life is a thinking man\'s action movie . \nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \n',1
'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor\'s effort . \noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" \nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison\'s \'the hurricane , \' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . \nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \nthrough the efforts of that group and carter\'s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \nthe film details carter\'s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \nthe book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra\'s eyes to the injustice that was carter\'s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \n \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . \nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \nit\'s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \nthe actor\'s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\'s length . \nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \nwashington\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \nhe doesn\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \n \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \njewison\'s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \nsadly , though , the film\'s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \nthere is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . \nthe canadians are good . \nthe cops are bad . \nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film\'s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya\'s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . \nlove\'s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \nit\'s too bad . \nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he\'s a racist pig . \" \ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \ncriticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \nfurthermore , much of carter\'s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \nof course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don\'t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . \nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it\'s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . \ncarter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he\'s not the only one . \nwashington makes this film look good . \ndenzel washington\'s \" the hurricane . \" \nsounds pretty good to me . \n',1
'i know that \" funnest \" isn\'t a word . \n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that\'s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i\'ve ever seen ! \" \nso to hell with webster\'s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i\'ve seen in a while . \ni can\'t remember the last time i\'ve seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy\'s farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\'re parodying that \'blair witch\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n',1
'expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you\'ve got baby\'s day out--an agreeably amusing children\'s comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant . \nthe plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old-money home . \nbut the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago ! \nfollowing the path of his favorite story , called \" baby\'s day out , \" baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site . \nwhile baby stays unscathed , the crooks fare worse for the wear . \nthe stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and , of course , suffer multiple crotch injuries . \n ( john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one . ) \nlike he did in planes , trains , and automobiles , john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set-up and extended execution . \nhere , he\'s aided and abetted by a director , patrick read johnson , whose choreography could rival a coen brother . \nbest bit : baby crawling across a busy city street . \nbaby\'s day out has only two emotions--awww and ouch--and the actors play them accordingly . \nforget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon , disposable as mom and nanny , respectively , the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing . \njoe mantegna is a great head stooge , barking lines like \" that little doo-doo machine is my retirement money . \" \nbrian haley has a great scene with a gorilla , while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegna\'s moe . \n * he * is funny . \nneedless to say , twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief . \n',1
'i have to say it . \ntim burton\'s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . \nok , that\'s off my chest . \nno more monkey puns , i promise . \nseriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin\' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . \ni know , i know , i promised . \nand for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton\'s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . \nmark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . \nhe crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . \ndespite being darker than the original , burton\'s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . \nsome of the movie\'s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . \nthen there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . \nthe seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : \" one thing you don\'t want in your house is a human teen-ager , \" he says . \nyou don\'t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . \ntouches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton\'s brand . \nlines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian\'s foot to try righting himself are : \" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . \" \nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \nanother of burton\'s in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth\'s gen . thade . \nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : \" damn them , damn them all to hell , \" he says before expiring . \nthat is the famous line heston\'s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet\'s terrible secret . \nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \nit is a masterful turn . \nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , \" can\'t we all just get along , \" echoing the words of rodney king . \nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton\'s technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \nburton\'s musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \nthe movie\'s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \nhe comes close , but falls short . \notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \n',1

'part one of \" the strangest movies ever made \" series at www . mediajunkies . com \nby scott watson \n[light spoilers , nothing you shouldn\'t read] \nexistenz has been called \" a gooey matrix \" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off . \nthe only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , \" real \" reality . \na major difference is that \" the matrix \" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true . \nand oh what a reality it is . \ndavid cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest . \nmaybe it\'s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre . \ntechnology is organic , but only some of it . \ncars are normal . \ngas stations are the same . \ncell phones are glowing bug like appendages . \nyou jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a \" pod \" ) . \nhigh technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters . \na famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt . \nshe is on the run ( from who , i\'m still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with \" someone friendly \" . \nthat someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) . \nunfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport . \nsort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game . \nluckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one . \nafter a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz . \nthe plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( \" it\'s a sign of the times \" ) . \nbut the plot , while cohesive in it\'s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe . \ncronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap , and it\'s up to you to figure out how all these things work . \nand that\'s the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place . \nyou learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it\'s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you . \nthere are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards . \nalso the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover . \nthere\'s lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station\'s name appears to be \" gas \" . \nit all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix\'s virtual world . . . \noh wait , i already do . \n',1
'by now i figured i\'d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i\'m complaining . \nto call him the \" master of suspense \" is an understatement . \nthe paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock\'s lesser movies , turned out to be one i\'d missed . \nthis one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring . \nthe story opens with the rich mrs . maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband . \nas mrs . paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world . \nto franz waxman\'s stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels . \nstripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband . \n \" a brief skirmish , and you\'ll be lunching at the savoy again , \" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial . \ngregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister . \n \" she\'s no murderess , \" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty . \n \" she\'s too fine a woman . \" \nhis attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd ) . \nunlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama . \ntypical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light . \nshe deflects her husband\'s affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client . \nthe dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs . paradine\'s portrait nearby . \nin the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires . \nto the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs . paradine acquitted because , if mrs . paradine dies , his heart will go with her . \nif she is freed , he will be able to forget her . \nas part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr . paradine\'s valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships . \ncharles coburn plays anthony\'s legal partner , sir simon flaquer . \nand charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield . \nthis being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge\'s house not long before the case begins . \ncourt tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems . \none , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying . \none sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations . \nas the judge\'s wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film\'s only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit . \n ( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ? \nat 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case . \ndon\'t miss it . ) \nin the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom . \nthe great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first . \nwatch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial\'s action . \nas anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr . paradine poisoned himself , mrs . paradine did it , or the valet did it . \nthe end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid . \nthe paradine case runs 1 : 53 . \nthe picture is in black and white . \nit is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested . \n',1
'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\'connell . \nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover \" the book of the dead . \" \nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \ndon\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\'s up to you to decide . \nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\'s skin . \nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \nwhen playing \" george \" in disney\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\'s , didn\'t get much personal attention . \nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \nthe mummy could have gotten an \" a \" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \ni didn\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \n',1
'in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . \ntry too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . \nin simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . \nin the end , he\'s not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . \nthere\'s no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . \nhe chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . \nthe characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . \nsimon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he\'s only two feet tall . \njoe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he\'s ready to know who is father is . \nnaturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . \nin a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he\'s god\'s instrument , and there must be a reason he\'s so small . \njoe doesn\'t quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other\'s only true friends . \nearly on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca\'s new boyfriend , and although the bond isn\'t immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . \nboth platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . \nthe audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . \nfinally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . \nmark steven johnson\'s sense of drama and writing is fantastic . \nthe script is loosely based on john irving\'s novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it\'s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from \'based on\' to \'suggested by . \' \nalong those same lines , it\'s almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . \nby no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . \nsimon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . \nin the present , however , it\'s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . \n',1
'while watching \" shallow grave , \" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens\' \" blood simple . \" \nboth are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . \nthe body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . \nboth films are also flawed , but for different reasons . \n \" blood simple \" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . \n \" shallow grave , \" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they\'d accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . \nthe events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . \nas the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . \nthey are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . \na man named hugo moves into the apartment\'s remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . \njuliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . \nthe three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . \nall of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes \" shallow grave \" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . \nother than the obvious question of why they don\'t report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . \ni will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn\'t give away too much of the plot . \nbroadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo\'s underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . \na police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . \ndavid , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . \ndirector danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . \nwhile i do not consider myself the \" happy endings are automatically stupid \" type , i thought that \" shallow grave \" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . \nthis could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional \" caper \" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . \ngranted , this isn\'t really a \" happy \" ending , but it\'s still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . \ni really shouldn\'t say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . \nyes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i\'d been cheated . \nstill , \" shallow grave \" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . \ni guess i just can\'t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away . \n',1

'capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be . \nmakes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence . \n \" serial killer chic \" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones . \ni\'ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry . \ni wasn\'t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero . \nthankfully , that\'s not the way henry works . \nthe director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work . \nit doesn\'t provide cheap-jack explanations for henry\'s behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him . \nat the film\'s opening , henry\'s friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago . \nin a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers . \nthey are damned together from that moment on . \nhenry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun . \nthe movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there\'s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv . \nthe pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron . \nno preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker . \nin a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment . \nthe movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation . \nhenry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting . \nmichael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well . \nthe producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn\'t see release . \nthe film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was . \ni\'m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of \" victim \" or \" hero \" . \nthen again , probably , so would henry . \n',1
'modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo\'s original tome . \nadapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . \nliam neeson stars as jean valjean . \nas a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . \nprison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . \nhowever , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . \nhowever , he runs up against one man who doesn\'t believe in reform . \ninspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . \nhe has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . \nhe once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . \ntwo women also get caught up in the struggle . \nfantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . \nher daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . \ninstead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . \ndirector bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo\'s novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . \nhopefully you won\'t , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . \nthe movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . \nthe experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . \nneeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . \nthe supporting cast is also extraordinary . \nthe only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . \nthe film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . \nthe novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . \nwhile it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . \nit , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing . \n',1
' \" very bad things , \" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn\'t help but be won over by the material . \nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . \nthe groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . \nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . \nafter a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone\'s terror , she is killed . \nas robert puts it : \" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . \" \nafter a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . \n \" okay , there is only one option now . \nyou can forget about calling the police , \" he says . \nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . \n \" very bad things , \" which is actor peter berg\'s feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , \" there\'s something about mary , \" wanted to be . \nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . \nthe screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . \nduring the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . \nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn\'t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . \nthere\'s more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . \ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . \ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . \nby the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , \" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , \" i couldn\'t help but crack up at how \" balls-to-the-wall \" this film had become . \njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern\'s wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . \nit is at this level that , \" very bad things , \" was so entertaining and surprising . \njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . \nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . \nalthough i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : \" very bad things , \" is not a movie for everyone . \nit is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . \nluckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . \nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and \" safe \" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . \n',1
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit\'s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \nthe lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \nsince then , though , disney\'s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year\'s hercules successively proving less and less potent . \nwith the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox\'s anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \nthe film\'s storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she\'s resolutely smitten , and she\'s such a pure and endearing character that one can\'t help but invest their heart with her . \nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams\' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \nwhile it\'s understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto\'s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia\'s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it\'s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \nis the film\'s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \n ( i\'m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film\'s heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \n ( she\'s the only reason i\'d even consider catching flubber . ) \nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \nhe easily milks his lovable character\'s comic moments for all they\'re worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid\'s big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . \npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars\' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel\'s father , king triton . \nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman\'s untimely death . \nnot only are mr . menken\'s tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman\'s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film\'s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character\'s dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \nmr . menken\'s score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken\'s fine score . \nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson\'s heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film\'s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \nduring the song\'s reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney\'s limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \nthere\'s no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film\'s reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney\'s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox\'s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \nin every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film\'s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film\'s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney\'s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \nbut although disney\'s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it\'s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney\'s modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \n',1
'after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last . \nredford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he\'s proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera . \nordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed . \nwhile the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um , \nrealism , and i\'ve never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing . \nthe horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery . \nscott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi . \ngrace\'s horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad . \nannie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace\'s newly-broken spirit . \neventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed \" horse whisperer \" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind . \neventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom\'s family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer . \nthe horse whisperer is delicately made . \ni dare say lyrical , since to many people\'s ear , that word is synonymous with boring . \nhardly . \nthe horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story . \nscott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p . \nrobert richardson\'s photography casts montana as heaven on earth . \n ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . ) \nthe underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom . \nhe is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse\'s motivation . \nunfortunately , one of the horse whisperer\'s only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford . \ni liked both of them , but i didn\'t necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly . \nluckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn\'t quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters\' complex relationships together . \n',1
'steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for \" the new yorker , \" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . \nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called \" in search of the wily filipino . \" \nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( \'everything being made now is crap\' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . \nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . \nhis accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called \" chubby rain , \" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . \nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america\'s top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . \nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . \nhe sends his cast members ( who aren\'t in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey\'s table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . \nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . \nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . \n ( as if that\'s not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) \nwhen he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble \" white code \" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . \nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey\'s adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . \nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . \nfurthermore , consider the enemies he\'ll make of popular scientologists . \npacing stricter\'s neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . \nmurphy\'s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta \" clearing . \" \nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin\'s invention . \nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . \n ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) \nmartin\'s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder\'s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . \nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin\'s crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading \" cahiers du cinema , \" or martin\'s nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . \nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . \nbowfinger\'s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . \nwe\'re also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem \" chubby rain , \" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . \n ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz\'s last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) \nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . \nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham\'s character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . \nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . \nmartin gets sentimental by story\'s end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? \nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . \n',1

' \" the endurance : shackleton\'s legendary antarctic expedition \" \nin 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot . \n28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . \ndirector george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in \" the endurance : shackleton\'s legendary antarctic expedition . \" \nthe expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . \nas the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . \nfor months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . \nshackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . \nonce on this \" safe \" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . \nhe and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world\'s roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . \nmiraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . \nthis ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . \nin the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . \nthe title of this fascinating documentary , \" the endurance , \" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . \nit is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . \nthe name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . \nit also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . \nwith astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . \nthe filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . \nafter the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . \nconsidering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world\'s harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . \n ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , \" south , \" an interesting companion piece for \" the endurance . \" \nif shackleton\'s original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . \nas you watch the story of \" the endurance \" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . \n ( shackleton\'s amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) \nthere are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though . \nactor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . \nthe nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary\'s first half . \nas the crew\'s adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events . \nhelmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of \" the endurance , \" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition . \ni can\'t think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds . \n \" the endurance , \" based on caroline alexander\'s book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and , even more remarkably , all 28 survivors lived to tell about it . \ni give it a b+ . \n',1

'plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side . \nbut this new guy is not like all the others , he\'s got ambition , he\'s got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . \nviolence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue . \ncritique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the \" great \" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending . \nhere\'s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . \nokay , so it\'s not entirely new , but it\'s definitely original when all put together as done here . \nthe thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . \nit\'s 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! \nyes , it\'s all about the suits , fellas . . . the \nitalian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that\'s ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . \nhere are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . \nbut that\'s not the basis of this movie . \nthe basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other . \nyou know how there are always these \" hanger-on \" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? \nwell , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that \nis , their boss . \nso all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . \nbut this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . \nof course , director paul mcguigan isn\'t trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn\'t over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . \nnope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . \nthe first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he\'s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! \n ( \" look into my eyes ! \" ) \nin fact , the last time that i\'ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers\' miller\'s crossing . \nscary shite . \nbut there\'s an ever better scene than that in this film . \nthis one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man\'s point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that\'s right , he \" does \" the guy in his underwear ) . \nthat scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . \nbut the flick\'s not perfect . \nin fact , i didn\'t mind malcolm mcdowell\'s voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . \nall he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( \" . . . so \ni opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . \" -it\'s \nlike , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! \noverdone . ) . \ni also didn\'t quite \" buy \" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it\'s supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? \ni mean , c\'mon . . . it\'s 30 years , man ! ! \ni don\'t know , somehow it didn\'t work all that well for me . \nbut one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot . \nforget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell\'s narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film\'s stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis . \nincidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it\'s the real deal ! \nnote : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time . \nit\'s also quite violent and i don\'t remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . . \n ; ) \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \namerican psycho ( 10/10 ) - a clockwork orange ( 9/10 ) - donnie brasco ( 8/10 ) - fight club ( 10/10 ) - get carter ( 7/10 ) - godfather ( 10/10 ) - godfather ii ( 10/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) - lock , stock & two smoking barrels ( 8/10 ) - pulp fiction ( 8/10 ) - reservoir dogs ( 9/10 ) \n',1
'at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember . \nthe 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ? \nnot in your dreams ! \nimagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you . \nbelieve it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter . \nthe story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious . \nmajpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert . \nas the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) . \nthey soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces . \nfrequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals . \nas the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it . \n`special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie . \nthree kings is much smarter than that . \nas the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray . \ni personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity . \nthis simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant . \naction sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence . \nthey are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts . \nnot john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) . \ngreat performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director . \nthree kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least . \nhighly recommended . \n',1
'this is the movie not the perfume . \na slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock\'s vertigo . \nit is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader . \nset in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy . \nhis real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes . \nupon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed . \ninspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers . \nbut the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper\'s car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found . \ngrieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop . \nsixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife . \nwhen he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife . \nher name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she\'s working there restoring art that is decaying . \nhe falls instantly in love with her and doesn\'t heed bob\'s warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her . \nsandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him . \nthe surprises to come weren\'t really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow . \nit plays too much like a rehash of the master\'s work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way . \n',1
'it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle , a jim carrey vehicle at that . \nand so it is . \n_the truman show_ is the most perplexing , crazed , paranoid and rib-tickling morality play i\'ve seen since i-don\'t-know-when . \ndon\'t credit carrey . \nit starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago . \nthe story , replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones , is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience . \n ( ironically , it was within these past ten years that \" reality-based \" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture . \nwho knew ? ) \none-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place . \nweir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling . \nit was weir\'s first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame . \nfor example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ . \nthe nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island . \ncredit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey . \ncarrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn \" on \" and act goofy whenever the camera is near . \nnot here . \nhis performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on . \nand although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image considerably . \nplaying one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey\'s life . \nno pun intended . \nbetter in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 \" work the problem , people \" character with dustin hoffman\'s megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian . \nit is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman\'s well being . \nyes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide . \nhe thinks . \nrounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs . \ndalloway ) as carrey\'s true \" forbidden love \" , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role . \nlaura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman\'s wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development . \nthe exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general . \nthere are other little problems with the script . \nare we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ? \nwas there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ? \nhow is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ? \nand couldn\'t christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ? \nthese little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work . \nthe audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman\'s mundane existence for no other reason than it is there . \nthe final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut . \nupon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome . \njust checking . \n',1
'everyone\'s heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene . \neveryone\'s heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . \nand everyone\'s got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance . \ngood ! \nthat\'s what you\'re supposed to do ! \noh , if you are one of the ones who hasn\'t seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven\'t heard about what happens , here\'s your spoiler warning . \ndeliverance was a real shocker for it\'s time ( 1972 ) . \nmajor advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry . \nwhen it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences . \nit was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) . \nbut by today\'s film standards and in today\'s world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn\'t as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g . \npulp fiction ) . \npulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny . \nbut in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter . \nthe story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory . \nthe initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others . \njoining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) . \nthe group\'s first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip . \nthey make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task . \ndrew also has the famous \" dueling banjos \" competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged . \nthe men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way . \neverything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone . \nthey encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them . \ned is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men . \ned nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist\'s back . \nthe other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body . \ndisposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film . \nwhile attempting to make a quick \" paddle for it \" , both canoes tip over . \ndrew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found . \nlewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition . \nthis leaves ed and bobby . \ned decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow . \nthe question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment \" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing \" will have more meaning in the future . \ndeliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i\'m doing it again ) . \nit is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic . \nit\'s definitely one of those \" must see \" movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . \n',1
'if you\'ve ever perused my college comedy diary \" another year in the life of a nerd \" ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i didn\'t get along with my first-semester roommate too well . \nin fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him . \nso when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room . \nthen i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk . \nscratch that idea . \nbut i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal . \nof course , in my case it would be a silent picture . \neven without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? ) . \ni\'m glad i did . \npeter falk\'s performance was actually what made the movie . \nand this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries . \nfalk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you \" columbo \" fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off . \nfalk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid\'s parents die . \nthe movie begins with the mom\'s death and the son moving in with his grandparents . \nafter a couple stops along the son\'s journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave . \nthe surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( \" communists ! \" ) . \nthe movie spans nine more years of rocky\'s relationship with his grandson , and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with--gasp--a woman , and starts spending all his time with her . \nso , in his grandson\'s absence , rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing , achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed . . . \nor am i confusing movie plots again ? \nroommates has an almost epic feel to it , covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die . \ndeath , though , knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie . \nroommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween . \nthe number can\'t be counted on one hand , unless of course you\'re the victim of some hideous genetic mutation . \nand you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie ( no , not duran duran ) . \ni won\'t come out and say it . \ninstead , i\'ll just sit here and hum \" eye of the tiger \" until each and every one of you figures it out . \nroommates plays on all the major emotions . \nit knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry . \nmovies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience , even though this one bombed at the theaters . \nmy point ? \nthere are no absolutes . \nor , another possible point , peter falk just isn\'t such a great box office draw . \neither way , this is still a good movie and you should give it a chance like i did , whether you hate your roommate or not . \n',1
'bruce willis stars as malcolm , an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons . \nthe now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife ( olivia williams from rushmore ) are celebrating his award , shoots malcolm in the stomach , then takes his own life . \nalmost nine months later , malcolm discovers cole ( haley joel osment , in a brilliant performance ) , another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient . \nhe takes on the child\'s case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one , alienating his wife in the process . \nhe soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead , and his life becomes forever turned upside down . \nalthough the first hour is very slow , the sixth sense turns out to be a very powerful and moving film . \ni was expecting this film to be mercury rising 2 , but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending . \nyou\'ll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll . \ni must give m . night shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written screenplay . \nthe cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is . \na lesser cast could have made this film a joke . \nbruce willis portrays his character perfectly , balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully . \nhaley joel osment shines as nine year old cole , showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off . \ntoni collette , looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriel\'s wedding , gives a strong performance as cole\'s mother , who is trying to cope with both her son\'s \" illness \" and the passing of her mother . \nfinally , olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband who\'s not around and flirtations with a co-worker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end . \nit\'s a shame that they show cole\'s abilities in the trailer , because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same , so we already know what\'s going on before most of the rest of the cast does . \nin retrospect though , the forty minute set-up is essential to enjoying the end of the film , so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film . \ni\'m glad that the run of teen-styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare . \nfilms like this , the similarly themed stir of echoes , and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to 1999 . \n[pg-13] \n',1
'richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . \nhowever , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . \ni wasn\'t disappointed . \nit wasn\'t a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . \none thing : what\'s with the title ? \nnot only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn\'t really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . \nin the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won\'t be able to think of or remember it . \nmartin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . \nhe loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . \nonce he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he\'ll get . \nwe soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . \nvail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier\'s father on the tv series ) . \nthere is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . \nwe see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . \nrichard gere does a fairly good job . \nat first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . \nbut we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . \nalfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . \nlaura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . \nher relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . \nthe actor who playes vail\'s investigator ( unfortunately , i don\'t remember his name ) is quite good . \nhis female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can\'t remember where i\'ve seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . \nthe best performance in the film was by edward norton . \nhe was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged \" butcher boy of st . mike\'s \" . \ni was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . \ni liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating . \n',1
'synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . \n ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) \nin the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . \na girl\'s parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she\'s dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . \nmulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . \nten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . \nthe emperor wants to reward mulan\'s valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . \nmulan\'s old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . \nthe disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . \nin disney\'s mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . \nold mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) . \nfearing for her father\'s life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father\'s stead . \nmeanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . \n ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) \nmushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . \nwith the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? \nopinion : east meets west . \ni know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . \nfrom their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan . \ni mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? \nyet this is the case in the disney\'s re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . \nthe end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney\'s best movies ever . \npersonally , i\'m also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . \nmulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . \nkids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . \nand adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . \nand adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . \nbut even the tiniest details reveal quality . \nthe movie\'s art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . \ncomputers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called \'attila\' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . \nand singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . \nbalance is crucial . \na movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney\'s cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! \nthe dream team . \nby the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you\'ve got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . \nit\'s rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . \nit\'s movie for any age , creed , gender , or color . \n',1

'what if one of our cities became the target for terror ? \nwhat can we do ? \nwhat can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? \nwhat basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? \nso far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world . \nit is the land of opportunities . \nit is the land of freedom . \nbut what if it became the new target ? \nthis dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality . \nwhen a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice . \nthe only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : \" release him . \" \nthen all hell breaks loose in new york . \na bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians . \na broadway theater is bombed . \nhostages are taken at a school . \nas the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law . \ndevereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil . \nanother person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities . \nhis staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! \nf moronic feds we\'re used to seeing in movies . \nhubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they\'re willing to reveal . \nbut the attacks escalate . \nthe fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy . \nthe land is under siege . \nthey have lost control . . a \nterror is coming from within . . \nwhat\'s great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life . \nit reflects reality . \nand that\'s why it makes such an impact . \nedward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season . \nthe director manages to tell several stories simultaneously . \nand so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective . \nhe is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) . \nhe takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved . \nthe palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii . \nthere are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the \" greater good . \" \nin the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom . \nwas that what the terror ! \nists really wanted ? \nthis film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially . \nbut to me these protests seem unnecessary . \nzwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys . \nthe script is therefore wonderfully balanced . \nagent hubbard\'s best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american . \nand it is quite often you hear lines such as \" my first boyfriend was palestinian . \nthey seduce you with their suffering \" or \" they love this country as much as we do . \" \nbut no matter how you twist this matter , you won\'t get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority . \nmore to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military . \nand thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! \nway . \ndenzel washington is dashing as always . \nin this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual . \nanette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . . \nbruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand . \nthe film is elegantly shaped . \nthe scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong . \nzwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism . \nhe tightens the intensity as the events progress . \nand when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising . \nit is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich . \nnor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values . \nit is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey . \nit has courage enough to get involved in politics . \nit questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense . \ni must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down . \nbut despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of . \n \" this is the u . s . army . \nit\'s a broadsword , not a scalpel . \nbelieve me , you do not want us in an american city \" - gen . william devereaux , \" the siege \" \n',1
'waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we\'re human . \' \nin the context of events to transpire , joe\'s line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . \ndoes being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? \nthrough the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . \nexpressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . \nin the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . \ndeputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob\'s myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . \nwe see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . \nwhat is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . \nwhat once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . \nto the audience , the deputy\'s quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob\'s delirium crescendos . \nlang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness . \nthe shot\'s composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . \nas the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . \nthe stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . \nbecause the camera does not track the deputy\'s movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . \nas the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . \nthis shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . \nwhile a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob\'s belly distorts the audience\'s spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . \nwe see close shots of people\'s faces , contorted by their rage . \nwith the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . \nin this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang\'s camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . \nin some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . \nlang\'s observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . \nas joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . \nlang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . \nusing his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man\'s volatility and `impulse\' towards inconceivable cruelty . \nreprising joe\' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity . \n',1
'few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker\'s adaptation of frank mccourt\'s memoir angela\'s ashes . \nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \ni\'m somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \nit\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \" i\'m important ! \" \nmccourt\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\'s , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \nas he comments , \" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \" \nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \ntwo of frank\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \ni imagine this doesn\'t sound like much of a plot . \nthat\'s probably because it isn\'t one . \nthese are people . \nthis is their story . \ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \nsupplementing parker\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\'t like or admire him . \nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\'s superb poster . \nit is breen\'s first feature film and he\'s extraordinary as young frank . \nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\'s soul through breen\'s sad eyes . \non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \n * spoiler warning ! \nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \nthe film\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \nhis mother doesn\'t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \ni haven\'t read the book , but i\'m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i\'m suspicious . \nanother thing that\'s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i\'m sure , is also explained in the memoir . \nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela\'s ashes stands tall . \ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \n',1
'accepting his oscar as producer of this year\'s best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \njuliette binoche\'s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film\'s 160 minutes can be taxing . \nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn\'t help but feel that greatness was in the air . \nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \n',1
'the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings . \ninvolved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done . \nhe urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own . \nmarshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base\'s beach in full view of the entire personnel . \nhank\'s reaction is one of amusement . \nhe\'s been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how . \nthe problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn\'t flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she\'s fantasizing about a fictious world where she\'d rather be . \ntypical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered . \nthe mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable . \nfrom hank\'s reports which state his opposition to the army\'s methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama . \ncarly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all . \nthe new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum . \nafter meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat . \ncarly openly flirts with the co . hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool . \narguments ensue . \nthe family becomes even more alienated . \nthe co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb . \nback at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father can\'t deal with their mother\'s problems . \none daughter says , \" he\'s blind and she\'s crazy . \" \nthe other answers , \" they\'re perfect for each other . \" \nit reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co\'s son ( o\'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed . \nshe forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open . \nhank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co\'s wife ( snodgress ) . \nhe confronts the c . o . \nbut not about carly . \nhe is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing . \na fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife . \nhank is arrested . \nwhat follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co . he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation . \ninstead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope . \nhe foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters . \ncarly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time . \nthe film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems . \nthe performances are solid throughout . \njones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife\'s rage . \nhe comforts her and offers protection . \nlange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family . \namy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should . \nblue sky is based on the story of the stagner family . \nthe screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) . \nthe film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 . \nhe had made such classics as look back in anger ( 1958 ) and tom jones ( 1963 ) . \norion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years . \nthe film joins an alread promising fall line-up of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone . \n',1
'my summer was recently saved by two very different movies . \non opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron . \nthen a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman\'s greenfingers even though it didn\'t feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott . \nhowever , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) . \nafter spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield . \nthe picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges . \nat first , briggs doesn\'t want to be there . \nhe\'s used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone . \nhowever , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature . \nthe two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift . \nbriggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers . \nafter the prison\'s governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he\'s awed at what briggs has accomplished . \nand he\'s struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison\'s grounds . \ngreenfingers , which is \" inspired by actual events , \" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that . \ndespite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show . \none renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent . \nof course , love will also rear its head ( no , not \" prison love \" ) . \nto hershman\'s credit , he doesn\'t pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year\'s lame marijuana comedy saving grace . \ni had to keep pinching myself when i didn\'t see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers . \nthe movie deals with people and scores on that concept . \nit\'s wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again . \ngive credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting . \nhis speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman\'s last stand in the shawshank redemption . \nowen\'s bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy . \nwritten by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs . \nmost come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs . \nthe mother can\'t believe what he\'ll do if her daughter \" burns the sunday roast . \" \nnothing is forced in greenfingers . \nthe funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines . \nprimrose and briggs\' relationship takes awkward steps . \neven when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it\'s done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so . \nafter grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america\'s sweethearts and the princess dairies , it\'s an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well . \n',1
'in zoolander , the world\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , \" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? \" \nobviously , the film\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \nit\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\'s model roommates all die in a tragic \" gasoline fight \" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \non the trail of mugatu\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\'s hoping to use mugatu\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \njerry stiller -- ben\'s dad who\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \nmaybe it\'s just because i can\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\'t had sex in two years . \nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \nzoolander\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \n',1
'one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it\'s a wonderful life isn\'t perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results . \nprobably the greatest \" feel-good \" film of all time , it\'s a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow . \non christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . \nyou see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . \nthis one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . \nclarence has got his own problems , however . \nclarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . \nthe bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . \nbut before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey\'s life . \nwe see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother\'s life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . \nwhen the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isn\'t sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . \none christmas , potter gets his chance . \nuncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $8 , 000 of the bank\'s money . \nwithout the money , the bank must close down . \ngeorge is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . \nclarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george . \nthis is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . \nit\'s a wonderful life does have its faults . \nthe movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . \nthe sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90\'s , like something out of a revisionist look . \nall the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . \nthere are , however , endearing moments in all of this . \ncapra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50\'s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . \nthe story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . \nthere\'s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . \nit\'s a little too nice for my liking , at times . \nthere is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . \nbut watching it\'s a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it\'s always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . \ncapra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . \ndonna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . \neveryone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . \nthere is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . \nstewart , however , is the king of all of this . \nhe is sometimes awkward , especially when saying \" merry christmas \" to all objects , animate or inanimate . \nbut he is james stewart , and he\'s lovably delightful throughout the film . \nhave i complained ? \ni shouldn\'t have . \nthis is a really good movie . \nno , this is a great movie . \nbetter yet , this is a phenomenal movie . \nthere is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . \nthis is one of those films . \nit is a \" feel-good \" movie , something people complain a little too much about . \nbut capra\'s reworking of \" a christmas carol \" is the greatest christmas movie of all time . \nthere , i\'ve said it . \ni have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . \nthey all loved it . \nthey loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . \nis it a little too sugar-coated ? \nmaybe . \nno matter . \nthis is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . \nit is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . \nit is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . \nit is frank capra\'s greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . \nfor about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless . \nthe rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless . \ni can\'t get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is . \n',1
'when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! \' \ni was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead . \nwhat makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script . \nthis writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral\' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between . \nhugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings\' . \nhe plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck . \nunfortunately , he is type cast in this role , but fortunately it works well for him in this movie . \nif only he would dither a little less . \njulia knows this role well . \nthe glamorous movie star who is searching for true love . \nthere are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness . \nhow sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with . \nthe writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels . \nhow differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment . \nhow the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice . \n',1
'ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , \nsynopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . \nrudy\'s girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy\'s elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy\'s friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn\'t pay for a bone marrow transplant . \nrudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . \njon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company\'s team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . \nwill rudy defeat leo ? \nwill he enjoy being a lawyer ? \nopinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . \ndirector francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . \nin the typical lawyer movie there\'s one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . \nhowever , coppola\'s movie is deliberately more low key . \n\'the rainmaker\' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . \nin the background rudy\'s voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . \ntwo factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . \nfirst , rudy\'s time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . \nalso , rudy\'s use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . \nthe end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age . \n',1
'finding the courage to face life full-on is a difficult task . \nsummoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job . \nif you\'re a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more

'look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . \nsome sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . \n>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . \nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . \nmaybe that\'s where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? \nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that\'s why there\'s no shortage of movies about this subject . \nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we\'re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we\'re completely unaware . \" \nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra\'s it\'s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \nthe \" road not taken \" approach isn\'t just a plot device , either . \nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \nshe doesn\'t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry\'s infidelity . \njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \nit shouldn\'t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland\'s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it\'s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry\'s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he\'s in . \npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \non another occasion , while laughing at gerry\'s plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" \nbut it\'s not all in the dialogue . \nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \nfor those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . \n',1
'apocalypse now , based on the novel \" hearts of darkness \" , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle . \na long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film . \nin many ways , this debate could go either way . \napocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made . \nin addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years . \napocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l . willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e . kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia . \ncaptain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with \" extreme prejudice \" because he has been deemed a murderer . \nwillard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation . \naccusing someone of murder in this situation is like \" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 \" , as he puts it . \nit doesn\'t make too much sense . \nescorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat . \nthe men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr . clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne ) . \nwillard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big . \nthe men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations . \nbut no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore . \nkilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf . \nsurf . \nthis is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson . \nduvall\'s portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific , and , he provides a number of memorable quotes . \neventually , captain willard encounters colonel kurtz\'s frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look , especially his followers . \none of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard . \nbut willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony . \nkurtz is actually well aware of willard\'s mission , and refers to him as \" an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill \" . \nyet willard is intent on completing his mission , no matter what shocking things kurtz does . \napocalypse now , possibly one of the greatest films ever made , is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war . \na movie that will hypnotize you with it\'s brilliant cinematography , apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war . \ndefinitely on the \" do not miss \" list . \nbe prepared for a very memorable film . \n',1
'casting \" doogie howser \" star neil patrick harris as mind-reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of \" starship troopers , \" a hugely entertaining , mega-budgeted sci-fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven , who\'s making quite a recovery from his 1995 g-string epic \" showgirls . \" \nsure , \" starship troopers \" qualifies as cinematic junk food , but that\'s forgivable when the junk food is this tasty . \neveryone needs a high-calorie change-of-pace from fall\'s onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait , and \" troopers \" does the job admirably despite its flaws . \nfor its first hour , \" starship troopers \" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of \" saved by the bell \" and \" g . i . \njane . \" \nin the distant years ahead , high school grad johnny rico ( casper van dien ) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot , so the couple is broken up . \nbut there\'s temptation awaiting both of them -- johnny\'s is in the form of an old friend ( dina meyer ) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush , while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor ( patrick muldoon ) . \npersonal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes , when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america , killing johnny\'s parents and destroying his home . \nour weakening , lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry , and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens\' home planet , where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good . \nbut the enemy is far smarter , more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for , and after an initial walloping , they must re-examine their strategy . \nthe exposition -- played like a futuristic soap opera -- is silly , but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans . \nonce we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous ( but never boring ) training sessions , \" starship troopers \" really kicks into high gear . \nits last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs , decapitations , disembowelments , brain removal , explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show . \nthe creature design and special effects are amazing as expected , and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic , imaginative high point . \nit\'s nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren\'t too derivative of the titular menace from \" alien . \" \nthese monsters are appropriately terrifying sights , especially the arachnids , a spider-scorpion-crab combo that\'s all sharp talons and even sharper legs . \nthey attack in packs of hundreds , and it\'s a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess . \nit matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying . \nthe occasional dramatic moments -- one cast member\'s death , the final resolution to johnny\'s love triangle -- are botched , a testament to how \" starship troopers \" fails to create any strong , outstanding characters . \nthese bland ken-and-barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm\'s length , but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la \" star wars , \" where even the slightest aliens had definite personality . \nthe acting is decent ( but never spectacular ) ; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory -- smallish roles on \" beverly hills 90210 \" and/or \" melrose place \" -- and it occasionally shows . \nvan dien , for example , is limited but perfectly likeable . \nin smaller parts are the afore-mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny\'s best friend and jake busey ( gary\'s son ) as johnny\'s sidekick ; the latter excels at playing creeps ( see \" the frighteners \" or \" contact \" ) but seems off-kilter as a second banana . \n \" starship troopers \" is based on the novel by robert heinlein , a sci-fi writer who hasn\'t exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994\'s howler \" the puppet masters . \" \nbut the overall familiarity to the \" alien \" trilogy -- and the promise of great gobs of gore -- could act as a crowd-drawer . \nits own possible influence , however , might well work against it when the franchise continuation \" alien : resurrection \" opens in a few weeks . \nwe will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall . \n',1
'weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . \nin the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . \nit certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . \nby now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . \n`seahaven\' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . \nfor 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we\'re given , \' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji\' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . \nthus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . \nin a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . \nthis allows us to comprehend and accept truman\'s world before we contextualize it . \nfor all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . \ntruman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . \nthe surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . \ncinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . \nas well , it employs wojciech kilar\'s piece \" zycie za zycie\' masterfully and beautifully . \nif the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney\'s characterization as meryl , truman\'s \" wife \" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman\'s `father\' , which feels curiously incomplete . \nthere are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman\'s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . \nthey wear buttons asking `how will it end ? \' \ni couldn\'t wait to know myself , though i didn\'t exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . \n',1
'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\'ll most enjoy . \nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\'s true colors begin to shine through . \nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" \nthat\'s not to say the men don\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \n',1
'with stars like sigourney weaver ( \" alien \" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . \nsadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . \nhelen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . \nincidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . \na year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . \ndetective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . \ncopycat \" borrows \" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . \nbut copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . \nmuch of the time wasted could\'ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . \neven so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . \nweaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . \nharry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . \nwhich comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . \ncopycat is a good thriller . \nalthough the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . \nthis worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . \nnice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . . \n',1
'robert altman\'s cookie\'s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . \nit is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . \nas this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . \nfirst we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . \nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . \nwe cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . \nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . \nwe also fleetingly see emma\'s lover jason ( chris o\'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . \nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . \nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . \nshe exclaims \" here i come ! \" \nand then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . \nsoon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . \nconvinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . \nshe makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . \nthe only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn\'t do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . \nmeanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . \nso begins cookie\'s fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as \" a southern spin on fargo , \" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers\' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . \nrobert altman\'s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . \nindeed , most of the characters in cookie\'s fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . \nglenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific \" aunt alexandria \" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . \nthe equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) \nthere is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . \ncookie\'s fortune is such a movie . \ni loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . \ni enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . \ni even liked the trite \" in the south everybody is related to everybody \" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . \ni\'m not sure why cookie\'s fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . \nperhaps it\'s that good ol\' southern charm . \n',1
'while watching wes anderson\'s rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film\'s anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . \nthe young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . \nschwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like \" serpico \" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . \non the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore\'s baseball field ) in her honour . \nunfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max\'s plans to woo her . \nmax is one of the best-written characters we\'ve yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . \nas everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from \" the wonder years \" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . \nhopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . \nbill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven\'t yet seen from him . \nwhile this isn\'t his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . \nwilliams isn\'t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . \nrushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn\'t a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . \nanderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success . \n',1
'with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft\'s square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . \nno doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . \nbut why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? \nobviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . \neverything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . \noverall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don\'t sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . \nbut you won\'t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , \" wow . . . \" \nlike the series of games , final fantasy\'s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . \nit\'s the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien \" phantoms . \" \nwhenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . \nwhile many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a \" zeus cannon , \" dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a \" wave \" using eight collected \" spirits \" to counteract the phantoms and kill them off . \nwhile the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn\'t . \nit\'s unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out . \nperhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script . \nsome could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay . \nnevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes . \nwhy do these aliens feed on souls ? \nif they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? \nwhat is so special about the \" spirits \" that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? \nworse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who\'s doing the talking . \nfor the most part , it\'s bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don\'t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . \nthe only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . \nbut , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you\'re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . \nthere\'s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . \nyou\'d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more . \n',1
'after the press screening of \" moulin rouge , \" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues . \neveryone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images . \na pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it . \nanother enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye . \nwhen one fellow quietly stated \" i\'ve never really been a fan of musicals , \" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn\'t think of it as a musical . \nthere is so much going on in \" moulin rouge \" that \" musical \" seems too small a term to cover it . \n \" moulin rouge \" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o\' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience . \naustralian director baz luhrmann , the man behind \" strictly ballroom \" and \" romeo + juliet , \" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from \" the sound of music \" to \" smells like teen spirit . \" \nsumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , \" moulin rogue \" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the \" random \" setting . \noh , and it has a story as well . \n \" it was 1899 , the summer of love . . . \n \" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , \" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , \" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) . \nchristian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor . \nat once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying . \nchristian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession . \nworking with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named \" spectacular spectacular . \" \nzidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there\'s a catch ?

'an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d\'arc . \nin history jeanne d\'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish . \nshe came in a time where people desperately needed a saint . \na hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness . \ndirector/writer luc besson ( \'nikita\' , \'leon\' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft . \nbesson tries to recreate the person behind the legend . \nhe tries not to show her as a saint or a villain . \nhe shows her as a human being . \nin a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity . \nthe only support and hope is in god . \nat the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers . \nthis terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne\'s mind . \ngod is no longer her support . \nhe has become her obsession . \nshe starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny . \nwith the help of the wise yolande d\'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls . \nafter this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo . \nthe movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere . \nthe film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne\'s thoughts , imagination and conscience . \nbesson\'s visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle . \nbut the film is far from being flawless . \nthe script needs a lot of polishing . \nexcept for jeanne , there are no real characters . \nand although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing . \nas for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task . \nin the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost . \njovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect . \nbut though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( \'being john malcovich\' ) and dunaway ( \'titus\' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance . \nand even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part . \nbesides casting jovovich , besson\'s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting . \nthere are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces . \nand some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the \" three musketeers \" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) . \nthough all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france . \nand thus , there is no sense of realism in this film . \n\'the messenger\' has muscles instead of brains . \nthere is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking . \ndustin hoffman\'s appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise . \njeanne\'s character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained . \nwas she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? \nor was she truly a messenger of god ? \nthe film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious . \nbess o messenger\' is nothing more than a fairly good film . \nit is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater . \nmaybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue . \nit is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv-generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it\'s on the battlefield . \n',1

'the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . \neven pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . \nhowever , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . \ndavis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . \nwith the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . \nneedless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . \nshane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i\'m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it\'s worth , it delivers the goods . \nlike black\'s previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . \nthe humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . \nbut there\'s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . \nwhile ice skating ? \njackson and davis make a good team . \njackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . \nas good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . \nwhat makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn\'t take herself too seriously . \nshe is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . \nthis is not to say that she doesn\'t need work--sometimes she lays on the \" toughness \" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . \nbut should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . \nit seems as if davis and harlin\'s first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . \nanyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss . \n',1
'plot : good ol\' texan kid suddenly gets to play first-string quarterback on his high school team\'s football team , in a town where football is considered religion . \nthe coach is just about the biggest a-hole you\'d ever want to meet , who will do practically anything to win . \nthe good ol\' texan boy does not approve of said man\'s methods . \ncritique : a fun football movie . \nthis film was obviously geared towards the teen market , with mtv behind its production , a big tv star actor in the lead role , rockin\' hip music galore , and plenty of t&a . \nhaving said that , i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie , thought james van der beek gave a solid performance , loved the slick sounds , and yup , loved that t&a ! \ni actually thought this was a comedy going in , but overall , it plays more towards the dramatic , than a comedy . \ni also enjoyed jon voight\'s performance as the stubborn dick coach , as well as many of the other character players on the team . \nthis is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination , but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the \" fun \" game of football , or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and forty-five minutes in the movie theatre ( or in the comfort of their own home , depending on where you watch this stuff . ) \nall in all , i would definitely watch this movie if you like football , play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football . \nyou could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys and girls running around doing their stuff . \nand did i mention the t&a ? \n : ) \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : james van der beek actually started acting after a concussion stopped him from playing football in real life . \nhe is the oldest of three children , and his father is a cellular phone salesman while his mom runs a gymnastics studio . \nhe\'s born in connecticut and received $200 , 000 for his role in this film . \nactor scott caan , who plays football player \" tweeder \" in this film , is the son of famed actor james caan in real life . \nthat\'s right , he\'s sonny\'s son ! \nactress amy smart , who plays van der beek\'s girlfriend in this movie , also played the main star\'s girl in the 1999 film outside providence ( 6 . 5/10 ) . \nscreenwriter w . peter iliff also had a part in writing the screenplays for the 1992 harrison ford film , patriot games , and the keanu reeves surfing flick , point break . \ndirector brian robbins might be best remembered as the \" cool dude \" from the tv series \" head of the class \" . \nhis name was eric mandrian and he generally wore a long , black trench coat on the show . \nthe book mox ( james van der beek ) is reading on the sidelines in this movie , hidden inside the team\'s playbook , is \" slaughterhouse-five \" by kurt vonnegut , jr . the high school fight song played at the pep rally is the texas a&m war hymn . \n',1
'it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . \nhe had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . \nfor those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . \nto achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series\' theme , which is missing in the movie ) \" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space \" , and is monitoring nelson\'s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . \nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . \nthe format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . \nonly two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester\'s sidekick , tv\'s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . \nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . \nfor their big screen outing , the producers have chosen \" this island earth \" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . \nunfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today\'s standards , are less than impressive . \nnelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan\'s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle\'s kingdome , and most of them work . \nunfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite\'s movie theater seem out of place and aren\'t particularly funny , but at least they\'re fairly short . \nthe big question about this movie though is : why ? \ni presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . \nso , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . \nnevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you\'re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . \ngiven its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of \" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies \" it does well . \n',1
'after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \nthe charisma of the two leads ? \neven now i can\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \ni don\'t think any of the romances i\'ve seen have been classified as such . \nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \nit was traditional , magical . \nwe knew it couldn\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\'s direction . \nfrom the very first bird\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\'re in for something sweet . \nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \nreal people don\'t act that way ; real people aren\'t that nice . \nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\' existence . \nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\'s wardrobes . \nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \ndisappointingly , david alan grier\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\'s heart . \nwe already know that there\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won\'t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \nit shows . \nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\'t imagined . \n',1
'one of kyle mclachlan\'s earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) , species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . \nplot : a science-fiction picture set in modern times , this thriller follows the exploits of an \" entity \" from outer space , who likes to inhabit human bodies , use them up until they are completely worn out , and then switch over to the next available receptacle . \nfbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this \" thing \" before it\'s too late . \ncritique : this fast-paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8/10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra-violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock \'n roll attitude . \nthen again , how can you go wrong with an \" alien \" that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? ! \ngranted , the plot isn\'t the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad , find alien , kill alien ) , but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture . \ni wouldn\'t recommend it to those who don\'t like car chases , murders , and bland acting , but for all the rest of you out there , those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again , sitting back , slamming back some salsa\'d nachos , and relishing in the cheeze some call film . . . \nhave a blast ! ! \ntwo scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gore-fest . \nthe opening sequence is one of the most rockin\' scenes to open any action movie , and the subsequent extra-terrestrial \" transformation \" is another eye-catcher . \neven the late 80\'s special effects were okay . \nfollowed by the hidden ii in 1994 . \nlittle known facts : this film was kyle maclachlan\'s first non-david lynch foray into the world of feature films . \nhis first two movie appearances were in lynch\'s wretched dune ( 4/10 ) and the sensational blue velvet ( 8 . 5/10 ) \n',1
'i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . \ni went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . \ni came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . \nthe basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . \nhe\'s now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . \nhe\'s given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern\'s character works through his divorce . \nhis loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch\'s house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . \nduring the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly\'s ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . \nafter a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . \non the way , they run into curly\'s twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . \nfirst of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . \nthe scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . \nthere is some character development during the film . \nthe actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . \nthe movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . \nthe movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . \nhumor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . \nthere are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . \nhowever , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film\'s manipulation of the audience . \nthe film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend\'s butt . \nthis is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . \nthere were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn\'t worry more about water while tromping around the desert . \nsome strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . \nsince the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . \noverall , i\'d say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . \nit may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain . \n',1
'synopsis : retiring detective jerry black ( nicholson ) becomes involved in the case of a murdered girl , and promises her parents that he will find the killer . \nhe purchases a gas station on a route he believes the killer takes , and there befriends lori ( wright penn ) and her young daughter . \nas jerry and lori fall in love , can he do what must be done to fulfill his pledge ? \nreview : at first , \" the pledge \" appears to be just another standard , if well-executed , crime drama . \nit is anything but ; in its final hour , it turns the corner and becomes a riveting , terrifying study of its lead character , jerry black . \npenn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre , but they are just window dressing . \nhis interest here , unequivocally , is jerry , a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes the entirety of the his existence . \nat first , we see this only in small hints ; some of his habits change , for instance , and he suddenly takes up smoking in a big way . \nbut then , when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori , the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus . \nnicholson is fantastic , portraying black with rare subtlety and animus ; jerry\'s gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck , a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from . \npenn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast , too . \nonly eckhart disappoints as jerry\'s replacement , stan ; he never seems entirely convincing , too much a tool of the plot . \npenn\'s direction is astounding , each frame looking as though it is parched -- of water , perhaps , or of sanity . \nit all builds up to a shattering , devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably in the mind long after the house lights have come up . \n',1
'luckily , some people got starship troopers . \nsome people knew it was supposed to be silly . \nfor those of you who didn\'t , how could you miss it ? \nfrom the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . \ni guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don\'t recognize such goofy humor . \nsuch a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned . \nfirst thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up . \nmeet the equivalent of \" beverly hills 90210 \" meets \" mighty morphin power rangers \" . \nfour close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country . \njohnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot . \ndizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it\'s possible she\'s joining merely to follow rico , whom she\'s always had eyes for . \nif you saw these three on the street , you\'d automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie\'s cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of \" seventeen \" magazine . \nthe lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture . \n ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . \nright off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . \nbut a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . \nwith his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . \nwell sorry , rico suave , but there\'s no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . \nthat\'s right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn\'t going to destroy . \nwith a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . \nwhat starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . \nit\'s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it\'s not as recognizably so . \nit\'s a spoof so subtle that many won\'t recognize the spoofery . \nif you deem this as sci-fi/action , you\'re wrong . \nit\'s sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . \ngore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . \nyes , it\'s graphic , but it\'s also brutally phony , and that\'s what makes it such great fun to watch . \nnot since the old \" mr . bill \" skits on \" saturday night live \" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . \npeople were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . \nperhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters\' barbie dolls as young children . \nwith the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it\'s a good chance this is the case , whether we\'re fully aware of it or not . \nstarship troopers has it\'s slow parts , but it\'s truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy . \naside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . \nwhen the spaceship passes a meteor , it\'s quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . \nif you\'re looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . \na beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore . \nthis is brainless heaven . \njust remember not to think . \n',1
'the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it\'s hard to remember which one you\'re watching at any given moment . \n \" mulan , \" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . \nonce again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . \nadd the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . \nbob\'s your uncle ! \nbetter make that walt\'s your uncle . . . \nkids will no doubt go ga-ga over \" mulan \" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . \nmaybe an animated feature without--shock ! \nhorror ! --the \nsongs , for example ? \nor maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? \nhow about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? \nit isn\'t gonna happen . \nlike disney\'s previous entries , \" mulan \" is slow to make its mark . \nthe animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy\'s animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . \nhowever , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . \nhighlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today\'s computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( \" i\'ll make a man out of you , \" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . \nvoiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney\'s strongest female character to date . \nwhen hordes of huns pour over china\'s great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . \nsince mulan\'s father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father\'s armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . \nattracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . \nwong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . \nshe\'s a woman of the \'90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time . \n',1
'razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 . \nofficial release : halloween \nreviewed by vince yim \n`you think you know all about vampires . . . believe \nme . . . you \nknow f * ck all . \' \nwith these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) . \nmade into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being . \nso , what\'s an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? \nwith that out of the way , let me say this . \nthis film is bad . \nthis film is really , really bad . \nyet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable . \nwith all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade . \nstill , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film . \nagreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . \nperiod . \nrazor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film . \nthe film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn\'t sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples\' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) . \nbut aside from that , it doesn\'t stray too far away from horror film conventions . \nthat is , unless that is intentional . \nrazor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese . \nyou can\'t help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle . \nyou\'ll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) . \nyou\'ll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably . \nand then , there\'s the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . \nthe film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you\'ve most likely forgotten the main point of the story . \nbut in case you really care , she\'s been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she\'s leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . \nas much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups . \nalmost destined for cult-status , the film\'s campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film . \nwhile this may not necessarily be the film you\'d want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies . \n',1
'hedwig ( john cameron mitchell ) was born a boy named hansel in east berlin . \nas a teen seeking his \" other half , \" he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g . i . \nluther ( maurice dean wint ) . \nthe operation , performed by a hack surgeon , is botched , and the \" angry inch \" is all that\'s left . \nnow a \" she \" , hedwig comes to america , is abandoned by luther , forms a rock band and falls for her 17-year old lover/prot ? g ? , tommy , only to be rejected by him later , too . \nshe and her band , the angry inch , shadows the now-famous tommy gnosis across the us ( for revenge ? ) , but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in \" hedwig and the angry inch . \" \nfirst time helmer john cameron mitchell , along with composer/lyricist stephen trask , created and starred in their acclaimed off-broadway production that has become the movie . \nand quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs , outrageous costumes , sets and makeup and , especially , a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character . \nmitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for . \ni am , by far , not a big fan of musicals . \nsure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse\'s \" all that jazz \" and \" cabaret , \" but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea . \n \" hedwig and the angry inch \" is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from \" the rocky horror picture show \" and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols . \nthe original songs , by stephen trask ( also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch ) , are full of energy and variety and , even though it\'s not my kind of music , i found every one entertaining and fun . \nthe audience i saw \" hedwig \" with thought so , too . \nthe main attraction to this one-man/woman show is the presence of its star . \njohn cameron mitchell gives a solid , sometimes fun , sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self-enlightenment and love . \nas a young boy growing up in east berlin , hansel is abused by his g . i . \nfather and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that \" mother would make me play in the oven \" where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio . \nlater , as a young man , he meets luther , another g . i . \nand is swept off of his feet . \nthe ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after . \nflash forward to a trailer park in junction city , kansas , and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy . \nfrustrated and broke , she takes on baby-sitting and the odd \" job \" to make ends meet . \nshe also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born . \nshe meets , falls for and loses young tommy , who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation . \njealous and angry , hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommy\'s tours and , with the help of her manager , phyllis stein ( andrea martin ) , is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs . \nhedwig and the angry inch get gigs , not coincidentally , at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing . \nthings finally come to a head , so to speak , in new york city . \nthe popularity of the off-broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready-made audience base for \" hedwig . \" \nthe wit , humor , music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults , but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been . \nit is this one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its \" internationally ignored \" rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role . \nthere isn\'t a lot going on with other characters , though there are amusing little sidebars , like hedwig\'s backup singer/lover , yitzak ( miriam shor ) , deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of \" rent \" as a puerto rican drag queen . \nthe low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film . \nattention to details - hedwig\'s costumes and outrageous \" cabaret \" -like makeup ; the seedy trailer park setting ; and , the kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds , all on what has to be a beer budget . \n \" hedwig and the angry inch \" may not be for everybody , but the energy of the effort , the songs , the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch . \nif you\'re a fan of contemporary , edgy music , it is an even bigger draw . \ni give it a b+ . \n',1
'jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s . \nenterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960\'s series , star trek . \ngone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . \nas usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . \nthis time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist\'s will . \nit turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists . \nof course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . \ninsurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . \nthe film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . \nin this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . \nit doesn\'t do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . \nmany of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . \nthe other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . \nthere are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? \nthe explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham\'s aliens who number only a couple of dozen . \nso the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that\'s plausible . \nbut in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . \nthe other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . \nworf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . \nno problem so far . \nworf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . \nin the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . \nwhat little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren\'t hanging on every word on the screen . \nmy minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . \nwhile many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies . \nthe special effects are among the best for the star trek series . \nthe action is plentiful and well done . \nthis is a very good-looking movie . \nit should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . \nit is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . \nthey interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . \nmost star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . \nif you\'ve always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind . \nstar trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones . \n',1
'when i first saw the previews for ron howard\'s latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . \na show about nothing ? \nsounds like \" seinfeld . \" \na guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? \nsounds like \" the truman show . \" \nwhat is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? \nwhich is why i was pleasantly surprised by \" edtv , \" which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity . \nthe writing , by howard\'s longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus . \nin the hands of a less-experienced director , \" edtv \" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday\'s meatloaf . \nwith their \'true tv\' cable ratings being threatened by \'the gardening channel\' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers . \nprogram director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment . \nthe hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to . \nwhile scouting possible candidates , cynthia\'s camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame . \nbut on watching the videotape , the show\'s producers are more taken with ed than with ray . \nhe\'s cute , he says all the wrong things , and he\'s 100\% usda hick . \ncynthia\'s boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it\'s tough going in the early stages . \nthe most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth . \n \" action shot ! \" \nwags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster . \nyou get the idea . \nbut soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the \'true tv\' cameras are right there to document it . \ned\'s privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media . \nwho should ed go out with ? \nyou can be sure the pollsters have a list . \nnot only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent . \nmatthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america\'s latest phenomenon . \nhe and harrelson look like they really could be brothers . \nsally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed\'s mother , and martin landau is one of the film\'s highlights as al , ed\'s ailing stepfather . \njenna elfman ( from tv\'s \" dharma and greg \" ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting . \neven degeneres and reiner are better than you\'d expect . \nin 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called \" real life \" in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . \nthe scenes of ed\'s family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . \nas with most films by albert brooks , \" real life \" was funny , but absurd . \nthe funniest--and scariest--thing about \" edtv \" is that it is absolutely believable . \n',1
'go\'s is a gloriously slick hip machine . \ndirector liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . \nafter more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . \nthis is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn\'t arrive . \na la tarantino\'s pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . \nthe basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . \nher co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . \nzack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . \nperhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino\'s non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; \npulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go\'s wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . \ntorontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was \" not pleased with \" her turn as the ill-fated cashier . \nin go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . \nhere\'s an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . \nif she doesn\'t want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said \" no , \" not go . \nbut i digress . \ngo is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can\'t help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . \nin that sense , it\'s a departure from liman\'s last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan\'s trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story\'s clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald\'s for their latest commercial ) . \ni wish i cared more about go\'s characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . \nwhen the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . \nyet entertain me it did . \ngo is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . \nfichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . \nunlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable . \n',1
'meet joe black is your classic boy-meets-girl , boy-likes-girl , boy-gets-killed-in-horrible-accident , supernatural-entity-takes-over-boy\'s-body , supernatural-entity-falls-in-love-with-girl story . \nbased on the 1934 film death takes a holiday , meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love . \nwilliam parrish ( anthony hopkins ) is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday . \nhe has built a huge media empire , and raised two beautiful daughters , allison ( marcia gay harden ) and susan ( claire forlani ) . \nwilliam has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots . . . but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality , the one situation he won\'t be able to talk his way out of . \nand he has good reason to fear , for death himself is stalking him . \nhowever , death has a deal to make . \ndeath has taken possession of a man who has recently died ( brad pitt ) , and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living . \nin return , william gets to live a few extra days . \nof course , he agrees . \ndeath , under the human name of \" joe black \" , gets to experience life as a complete innocent . \nhe never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter . \nand he\'s not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love . \nbut , is their affair doomed to an early demise ? \nat nearly three hours in length , meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side , though it never gets boringly lengthy . \ninstead , the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations . \nyou get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere , rather than being hurriedly rushed through it . \nthe romantic angle works well , though , surprisingly , the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter . \nthis is most likely due to anthony hopkins , who once again displays his superb acting skills . \nwilliam is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life , and doesn\'t want to let it go . \nby contrast , claire forlani is merely the romantic interest . \nshe gets to show joe the ropes of love , but is hardly as interesting a character . \nas joe black , brad pitt seems a bit stilted . \ngranted , he\'s supposed to be out-of-place , but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role . \nstill , he is able to hold his own , and over the course of the three hours , his character begins to grow on you . \nthe main character who seems out of place here is drew ( jake weber ) , an ambitious executive in williams\' company who is joe black\'s main rival for susan\'s affections . \nweber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash . \nthis cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters . \nthe supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily , but never distractingly so . \nwe never learn what is the exact nature of death , or why he\'s never done something like this before . \nit actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices/accents . \n ( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . ) \nand the ultimate resolution to one of the film\'s supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial . \nstill , even with the film\'s length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn\'t necessarily expect from a film about death . . . but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow . \n',1
'one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . \nthe purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . \nsometimes the stories are compelling . \nsometimes they\'re not . \nbut , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i\'ve never been bored by any of the enterprise\'s numerous missions . \nstar trek : insurrection is no exception . \nthe film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it\'s the worst in the series ) , but i\'m not really sure why . \nit\'s an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . \nsome say it\'s a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . \nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that it\'s boring . \ni simply enjoyed the film . \ninsurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba\'ku ; the ba\'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . \nof course , these peaceful people can\'t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son\'a , led by ru\'afo ( f . \nmurray abraham ) , to mess everything up . \nthe son\'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba\'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . \nthat\'s when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba\'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba\'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . \nso , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba\'ku in their natural habitat . \nwhen dealing with a series with as much history as this , it\'s not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . \nthis is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . \ninsurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . \nstewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . \njonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . \nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . \nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son\'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba\'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . \nif i have any complaint about the film , it\'s that it tries to take a moral stance when it\'s not very appropriate to do so . \ni don\'t think it\'s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba\'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . \nbetter yet , why couldn\'t they have co-existed ? \ninsurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . \nwith it\'s inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn\'t seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . \ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . \n',1
'i don\'t know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn\'t this one . \nthe popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring . \nin my personal opinion , they couldn\'t be more wrong . \nif you were expecting airplane ! -like \nlaughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment . \nhowever , if you\'re just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see . \nhonest , it is . \nthis story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america\'s airwaves in 1939 . \npenny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner\'s secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment\'s notice , partly due to the fact that they haven\'t been paid in weeks . \namong the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back . \nunfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation . \nwhile trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn . \nmary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i\'m trying to be unbiased so i won\'t tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time . \nalong with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a . \nlaw ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait . \nthe special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn\'t very difficult to do ) in many scenes . \nalthough the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie . \noverall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use . \nsome comments collected from friends : \n',1
'when i first heard that disney\'s next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . \ni was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . \nthat effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . \nwhen i saw the trailers , i was thinking \" hmm . . . \nthis isn\'t bad at all . \nthis just might have potential . \" \nwhen i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . \ni have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? \ni was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . \nphil collins\' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . \nthe score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . \nso , the soundtrack wasn\'t bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . \nthis film could be good . . . \nbut will it be ? \nwhen i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney\'s tarzan is surprisingly decent . \nthe story starts out with tarzan\'s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . \nhowever , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan\'s parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . \nkala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . \n \" it\'s not our kind , \" he says . \nhe agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but \" that doesn\'t make him my son . \" \ntarzan grows up , vowing to be \" the best ape ever \" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can\'t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . \none day , a new animal shows up : humans . \nthis is where jane comes into the picture . \nshe is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . \ntarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . \neven though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . \nclayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . \nworse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . \nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? \ni\'m not gonna tell you , sorry . \nyou\'re gonna have to see for yourself . \nand see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . \nthe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . \nin fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox\'s anastasia and dreamworks\' prince of egypt . \ncould it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? \nthe casting is fairly good . \ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . \nnicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . \nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson\'s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . \nminnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . \ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn\'t have a problem with her . \ni take back my insult on driver . \nit\'s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney\'s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . \non the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . \nhe might not be the strongest character in the film ( he\'s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed\'s vocal work contributes greatly . \nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o\'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . \nshe also has a fiesty attitude ( \" i\'m gonna kill ya ! \" \nshe says , more than once ) . \ni almost sung along with her during one of the film\'s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human\'s camp , via song , er , scatting \" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah \" . \ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she\'s a good singer . \nnot that she was the only funny character in the film , though . \nwayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into \" un-sanitary \" water . \n ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . \nthe songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . \nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . \ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . \nthe story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . \nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \'n sync version of \" trashing the camp \" from the film . \ni heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . \ni was upset that it wasn\'t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \'n sync to see tarzan . \noh , well . . . \noverall , i was enthralled with tarzan . \ni wouldn\'t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney\'s greatest achievements . \ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough\'s tarzan . \n',1

'elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s . \nit is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings . \ninternally , the catholics wage war against the protestants . \nmeanwhile , spain , scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power . \nlittle does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival . \nthe film charts elizabeth\'s tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom . \nas a protestant , she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen . \nbut her half-sister queen mary ( kathy burke ) , deathly ill and unable to conceive a child , pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne . \nmary gives her her blessing on only one condition : that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land . \nonce declared queen , elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault , both by her own subjects ( including the duke of norfolk , played with steely-eyed grace by christopher eccleston ) and by forces abroad . \nslowly but surely , the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom . \nelizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers . \nher closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush , in a perfectly subtle performance ) . \nalso on her side is sir william cecil ( sir richard attenborough ) , her well-meaning but misguided chief adviser . \nwith few people she can trust , elizabeth must prove her self-worth any way she can , even if it means being the iron-fisted ruler she secretly despises . \nblanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth . \nshe portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self-consciousness and shrewd charisma . \nthough not a classical beauty , blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk . \nshe is at home with her character\'s playful tendencies , particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley ( joseph fiennes ) . \nwhether fending off unctuous suitors or \" playing \" the houses in court , blanchett\'s elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike . \nalmost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur\'s visual delights . \nhe and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes . \nrolling green hills , extravagant ceremonial galas , dark and foreboding corridors -- all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation . \nthe castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here . \nthough writer michael hirst\'s script gets a little murky at times , and his injections of humor get a little overplayed , elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing . \nas a whole , the story survives because elizabeth\'s struggle is one which deserves attention . \nby the time she makes her shocking ( but very sensible ) final declaration , we\'re ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen . \n',1
'with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . \nthe fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . \nat first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski\'s sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . \nbut despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . \nit\'s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . \nreeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with \" trinity \" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as \" morpheus \" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . \nneo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . \nmoreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . \nneo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually \" the one \" prophesized to come and save the world . \nreluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . \nthe film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . \nhow exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? \nand if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? \nunfortunately , the matrix doesn\'t provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . \nperhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . \nweaving\'s stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . \nlike robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . \nweaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . \nthe film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . \nit seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . \nin a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . \njust seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . \nhowever , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . \nthe matrix isn\'t a classic . \nits open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . \nit fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . \nit also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . \nreportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . \nunfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . \nthe matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . \njust don\'t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . \n',1
'i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean\'s war picture . \ni still think that \" the bridge on the river kwai \" doesn\'t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute\'s list of the 100 greatest american movies . \nand i think that \" 12 angry men \" , \" witness for the prosecution \" and \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . \nbut i can\'t deny the importance of \" the bridge on the river kwai \" - cinematically and in its contents . \nthe film is set in burma in 1943 . \na batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . \nbut the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn\'t work as simple workmen . \nstruggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . \nafterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . \nhe considers it an opportunity to raise his men\'s morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . \nbut the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . \na flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . \nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . \nand the film doesn\'t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in \" paths of glory \" . \nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . \nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . \nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . \nthe audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson\'s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . \nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . \n ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) \nthat means , the picture isn\'t perfect . \nbut it has a lot of virtues as well . \n \" the bridge on the river kwai \" shows the \" madness \" of war and what it can produce in people\'s minds . \nit shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . \nand lean\'s film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . \nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . \ndavid lean\'s direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . \nhis film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . \nthe film is also well-photographed and has an apt score . \nalec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . \nthe other actors deliver fine performances as well . \ni like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses . \n ( c ) karl rackwitz ( klein k ? ris , germany , 1999 ) \n',1

'it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste . \nindeed . \nwhile perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration . \ni felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps-and despite the final shot\'s ambiguity , i left completely satisfied . \nhenry fool ( \" used to have an ? e\' \" ) arrives at garbageman simon grim\'s house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henry ( martin donovan look-alike ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who has been \" exiled and marginalized \" by the publishing community because of his criminal activity . \nsimon\'s poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high-school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its \" pornographic \" content . \nmeanwhile , henry seduces both simon\'s dependent mother ( porter ) and immature sister ( sundance queen posey ) with philosophical babble ( which is by turns brilliant and inane ) and breathy animal lust . \nthese story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher-student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself . \nhenry fool is sprinkled with hartley-ian flourishes : simon drinks milk from \" udderley\'s \" ; the big teen hang-out is called \" world of donuts \" ; simon wears his garbageman\'s uniform throughout ; the editing style is decidedly elliptical . . . \n ( which is key to the conclusion\'s said ambiguity ) . \nthe performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously \" quirky \" ; the introductory scenes are a chore . \nthese people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren\'t pop slackers . \nthe story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of . \n ( shades of film school . . . ) \nthe finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one\'s patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length . \nhow refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character . \nand unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded . \nthis , hartley\'s seventh feature , is contemplative about \" the artist \" ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon\'s work , and it\'s a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers\' pens . \n',1
'this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . \nothers that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . \nand , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . \nreceiving a summer grant to study \" chemo-electric therapy , \" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . \nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . \nhis main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don\'t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . \nthat he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . \nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . \nthe third view in all this is the artist\'s , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist\'s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , \" why shouldn\'t the same be true of the scientist ? \" \nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company\'s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can\'t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david\'s view but coming at it from a much different angle . \nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \nthat the director\'s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex\'s apartment . \ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david\'s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist\'s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \nwhat is progress ? \nwhat can one expect out of life ? \nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don\'t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso\'s guernica had for him . \nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

'capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers . \nwilhelm furtwangler , then the world\'s greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis . \nwhat were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ? \nhow much did he know about crimes against humanity ? \nthe us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation . \n , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nin my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo\'s sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists . \nszabo\'s follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope . \nit is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them . \nronald harwood\'s screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich . \nmaj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe\'s greatest classical music conductor . \nwhen other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen . \nafter the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes . \nhe secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty . \nfrom there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra . \nas he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation . \nthere is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting . \nperhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed . \nif so , perhaps he can never come to the truth . \nin large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler . \nwhere the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous . \nit has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act . \nwhen it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation . \nperhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is . \nwe are given clues to something but they are never tied up . \nin the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler . \nthe film is basically a stage play . \nthe visual is not very important . \ncorners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location . \nas with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing . \ni rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n[there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice . \nat one point we clearly see arnold\'s desk calendar say \" jan 16 tues . \" \na quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 . \nthe events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 . \na possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ] \n',1
'a sci fi/comedy starring jack nicholson , pierce brosnan , annette benning , glenn close , martin short and other stars . \na warner bros picture \nthe martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie . \nbefore entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like . \nmany people were saying that this film was silly rubbish , and there was no point to it all . \nhow wrong they were . \ni left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema . \nthe story is about martians attacking earth . \nusing ray guns ( hooray ! ) \nthey generally cause havoc around the u . s and other countries . \nnicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion , and also taking advice from his loopy officials . \nbut , basically , its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth . \nthe way people are killed by the ray guns is great , they is a hillarous ( and mildly disturbing scene ) involving a martian lady , a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away , ( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot ) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding . \nbut , most of all , this film is fun . \nthe martians are full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable . \nthe film is a million times better then the dire independance day , and is a real tribute to the tacky \'50s invasion movies . \nthey are is a great score by danny elfman , and lots of laughs . \nthis has to be the best invasion i\'ve seen for a long time . \n',1

'the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn\'t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . \nbille august\'s high-profile adaptation of victor hugo\'s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . \nfor those not familiar with hugo\'s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . \nafter serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . \nimmediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . \nthat he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean\'s prison camp , on his trail . \nthematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . \nyears after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . \nvaljean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . \nthe \" father \" and \" daughter \" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . \nthe decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year\'s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla\'s sense of snow . \nhe and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . \nproduction designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . \nneeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush\'s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . \nthe younger members of the cast fare less well . \ndanes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . \nas technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . \nwhile i was touched by valjean\'s relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . \nnot even reaching the \" touching \" level is the cosette-marius pairing . \nmy only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others\' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius\'s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . \nher presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . \neven so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex . \n',1
'john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it\'s good side and it\'s bad . \nit\'s held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that\'s pretty satisfying . \njames woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie . \nthe good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence . \nthe bad : no scares . \nyes that\'s right , even though being directed by one of horror\'s most cherished directors , \'vampires\' is the least bit scary , if not at all . \njames woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the \'master\' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight . \ndaniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn\'t that funny . \nin the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy . \nof course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death . \nafter throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it . \nthey kill almost all of jack\'s team , leaving only a few alive . \nsheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire . \nshe is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek . \nthey have to fight they\'re way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects . \n\'vampires\' definately could have been done better . \nthe make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had . \nit to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to \'fright night\' with the mix of violence and comedy . \njohn carpenter does a great job of directing this film . \nhe eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable . \nthe script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud . \ni much enjoyed \'vampires\' with a few exceptions . \nit\'s one of those films you see but don\'t take to heart . \nyou enjoy the time you spent and go on . \nthe recently released \'psycho\' is the same way , it\'s not as good as you\'d hope but it is fun and entertaining . \n\'vampires\' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer . \n',1
'the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone\'s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \nthis developed hatred is before the film\'s hero , ness , is even introduced . \ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \nthe film only gets better from this point . \nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930\'s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone\'s army . \neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \nalso very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . \n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \n',1
'i\'ll be the first to admit i didn\'t expect much from the emperor\'s new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald\'s happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume . \ni was dead wrong about all of those things . \nthe emperor\'s new groove is funny . \ndamn funny . \nand the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones . \nthe script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing . \nthe animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over . \nthe humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us . \nthe story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia . \nhere\'s the plot ; try to follow along . \nset in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor . \nwhen kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her \" assistant \" kronk ( seinfeld\'s patrick warburton ) change him into a llama . \nkuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco\'s water world theme park , to save him . \nthen the fun starts . \nfor the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination . \nyzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl . \nthe dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) . \ndavid spade and john goodman\'s character interactions make you feel like you\'re watching an old hope/crosby film . \nspade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times . \nneedless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days . \nthe best part about the emperor\'s new groove is how audacious the film is . \nthe sheer weirdness factor is very high . \ncross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah\'s boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal . \nsimply put , the emperor\'s new groove is one of the best children\'s films out for this holiday season . \nkids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue . \nthat\'s a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it . \n',1
'whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . \nhe made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs . miller \" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \" popeye \" ( 1980 ) . \nthe same holds true for his most recent film , \" the gingerbread man , \" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . \nby the time \" the gingerbread man \" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . \nthere\'s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o\'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn\'t feature a great showdown in a courtroom . \ninstead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \" the gingerbread man \" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman\'s trademark full-frontal female nudity . \nthe central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham\'s other lawyer heroes . \nhe is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . \nrick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . \na reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn\'t hard to surmise that rick\'s womanizing had a large part in it . \nwhenever he\'s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it\'s because he\'s been \" screwing around . \" \nafter an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn\'t lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . \nhe drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . \nrick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . \nit was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \" weird \" stuff like that . \nas another character puts it , dixon is \" a few beers short of six-pack . \" \nrick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . \nhe succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory\'s begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . \ndixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . \nfrom there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . \naltman\'s cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . \nif it isn\'t night-time , at least it\'s raining . \ngu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . \na great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . \nin the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . \naltman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \nbut , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . \n \" the gingerbread man \" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . \nhowever , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . \na great deal of the credit for the film\'s success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . \nhere , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . \nrick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \nwithout it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick\'s pain and frustration . \nthe supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in \" schindler\'s list \" ( 1993 ) . \ntom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . \nit doesn\'t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film\'s one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \nwhile \" the gingerbread man \" isn\'t in league with altman\'s greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \nsome critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don\'t make money . \naltman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \n',1
'ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? \nyou remember , he was the title character in that 70\'s sitcom , \" welcome back kotter . \" \nalways trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife\'s tuna casserole . \n \" so , \" you ask , \" where is he now ? \" \nmr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker . \nthat\'s right . \ni\'m not sure if it\'s his main source of income , but from what i\'ve heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time . \nand there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . \nyou silly goose . \nwell , gabe kaplan isn\'t in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler\'s life . \nbut rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . \nsorry about the segue , or lack thereof . \nmatt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . \nhe\'s been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . \nhe goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . \nin the beginning of the film , he\'s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play . \nmike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . \nmike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . \nmonths later , he\'s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . \nwhen mike\'s best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . \nalthough mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . \nto make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . \nthis is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . \nrounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . \nthe card clubs mike and worm frequent aren\'t very glamorous at all . \nthere\'s a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \nwe\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \ned norton\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\'re worth . \njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \nhe\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \nshe\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\'s reactions instead . \na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\'t find time for humor . \nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \n \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \nluckily , we\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\'s going on . \nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \nit\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \nwait ! \nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \nhang on ! \npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \nokay , i guess that\'s enough . \noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\'s mother . \n',1
'eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . \ncoincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox\'s animated film anastasia was released . \nyou know disney , they can\'t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old \" masterpiece \" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . \nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . \nthey still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . \nbelieve it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . \nit took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom\'s friends for a couple weeks . \nthey had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . \nby the time i got back home , i promised myself i\'d never see the movie . \nbut promises are made to be broken , especially when you\'re looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . \ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . \nthe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it\'s disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . \nit also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . \ni never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . \nthe heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . \nshe skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . \nshe\'s also dealing with feelings she hasn\'t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn\'t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . \nher father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the \" savage \" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . \nwhat\'s a king to do , though ? \nthe girl\'s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn\'t deter her . \nariel saves the prince\'s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . \nshe makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . \nyou know she\'s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . \nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl\'s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . \nshe\'ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she\'ll fall asleep forever . \nit\'s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the \'50s . \nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl , \" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \n',1
'synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . \nfarquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle . \ngrudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) . \nreview : one memorable aspect of disney\'s \" aladdin \" was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents . \n \" shrek \" does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy\'s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass . \nall the same , \" shrek \" does represent murphy\'s best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines . \nfor instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , \" now i\'m a flying talking donkey ! \" \nand despite its many contributors , the script for \" shrek \" is full of such comic gems . \nmyers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) . \n \" shrek \" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain . \nthings do go somewhat astray during the film\'s middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie\'s greatest strength . \nbut even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology . \n',1
'the rocky horror picture show \'special edition\' ( 1975 ) \nstarring : tim curry and susan sarandon \ncult films are never mainstream . \nthe casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out \'what the hell is that ? \' . \nfans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the \'hidden jokes\' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they\'re insane . \nthe rocky horror picture show , recently re-released in a \'special edition\' to video , is the mother of all cult films . \nperiod . \nlike some other cult films , most notably little shop of horrors , the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it . \nthis movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend\'s wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it\'s raining . \nthey go to a castle to try to use the phone . \nlittle do they know that the castle is owned by dr . frank n . furter , a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons . \nthe acting is pretty good overall . \ntim curry ( home alone 2 , legend ) is over-the-top as frank n . furter . \nit\'s interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon\'s ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet , the girlfriend of brad majors . \neven the singer meatloaf is in it ! ! \nthe songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way . \na sampling of titles range from damn it , janet to touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me . \nall the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing . \nbarry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon , but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience . \nmeatloaf sings like meatloaf . \nthe new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version . \nsadly , the songs are tacked after the credits- kind of defeats the purpose . \nif you want to see a different film , watch this one ! ! \n',1
'warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film \" fail-safe . \" \nif you haven\'t seen the film yet , proceed with caution . \nnutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . \nstill powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . \n-------------------- \" fail-safe \" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes \nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet \nreview by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- \nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn\'t have a winning side and a losing side . \nin a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . \nthe idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . \nthis is the theme of sidney lumet\'s \" fail-safe , \" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \n \" fail-safe \" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . \nthe premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . \nfive u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . \nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . \nsuddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . \na great deal of \" fail-safe \" \'s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia\'s borders--at any cost . \nthe plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . \nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . \ngeneral bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . \nthe events in \" fail-safe \" are fascinating because they\'re anything but predictable , but the real reason \" fail-safe \" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . \na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states\' role in all of it . \nmost of this is through the film\'s use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president\'s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . \nmany of the film\'s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . \nearly in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of \" strategy \" in a nuclear assault to \" minimize \" casualties . \n \" what\'s the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? \" \na guest asks impatiently . \n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \nthe problem with groeteschele\'s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o\'herlihy ) has often recommended . \non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \nis it wise ? \nis it even logical ? \nno , not really . \nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film\'s most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \none of groeteschele\'s \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it\'s merely absurd . \nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia\'s home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \nthe irony here is groeteschele\'s own mechanical theorizing . \nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn\'t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \njust how will the soviet union\'s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet\'s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn\'t possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o\'herlihy\'s character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film\'s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \nnevertheless , under lumet\'s direction and walter bernstein\'s intelligent adaptation of burdick\'s and wheeler\'s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \nit\'s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele\'s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \n',1

'when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space . \nit really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . \nbut weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet . \naustin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i\'ve had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks . \nif all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? \n-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex . \neven more to this movie\'s credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery . \nthe original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody . \nall of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america . \nironically , powers\' \" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! \" \nhas almost become an icon of the late 90s . \nthus another installment was inevitable , but it\'s also undoubtedly welcome . \nthe spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life . \nit brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones . \naustin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you\'ll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen . \nhe enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again . \nsurprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin . \nhe gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie . \nperhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately . \ninstead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe . \nthe spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that\'s okay by me because the original left us wanting more . \nby the time that one was over we haven\'t had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers\' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites . \neven by its conclusions , i\'m still not sure i\'ve had my fill of bits like \" do you smoke after sex ? \" \n \" i don\'t know , baby , i never looked . \" \nthis may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny . \ni don\'t know if i\'ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious \" just the two of us \" rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named \" mini-me \" . \ni don\'t have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort . \nindeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did . \nbut as far as i\'m concerned , that is enough . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ; \n',1
'ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python\'s spanish inquisition \nsynopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? \nbelieve it . \nsliding doors is a love \'what if\' story . \nthe gimmick is that it\'s really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . \nin the beginning , likeable gal \'helen\' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . \nso she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . \nhelen doesn\'t know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . \nthe film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . \nin story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . \narriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \nthis leads to a life where helen moves out . \nhelen\'s winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . \nin story two , helen experiences a different fate . \nshe misses the train , never meets james , and doesn\'t get home early enough to discover gerry\'s infidelity . \nin this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . \nwill the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? \nopinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . \nat last here\'s proof that there\'s still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . \nsliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . \nnot only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it\'s also easily gwyneth paltrow\'s best recent performance . \nwhen helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a \'shagging wanker , \' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she\'s talking about ! \nnor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . \nnobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , \" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! \" \nwhen helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn\'t take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she\'s supposed to be recovering from heartache . \nand handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn\'t the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . \ninstead he\'s a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . \nanother example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the \'hospital miracle\' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . \nin other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local . \nthere are minor inconveniences . \nsince sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it\'s occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . \ndistinguishing between the two stories isn\'t a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . \nbut in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it\'s slightly confusing . \nalso , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . \nbut these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . \npossibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? \nsliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little \'philosophy of fate\' thrown in . \nmonty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ? \n',1
'truman ( \" true-man \" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey\'s character in this film . \npresident truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . \n \" truman \" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . \nand burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . \nif hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv\'s world , the world where our protagonist lives . \ncombine all these names and concepts into \" truman burbank , \" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . \ntruman leads the perfect life . \nhis town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . \nhis idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . \nthe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . \n . \n . \nbut then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? \nthe next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . \nhe is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . \nwhen the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . \nhis suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . \nthe world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . \nthe elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . \na grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . \ntwo security guards grab him and throw him out . \ntruman is really suspicious now . \nit gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . \n \" it\'s best not to think about it , \" she says , trying vainly to change truman\'s memory . \ntruman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . \nat every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . \nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . \nyou know by now that truman\'s life is the subject of a television program . \nhis actions are \" real \" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . \ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . \nmeanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman\'s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . \nit\'s sort of like westworld told from the robots\' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs\' point of view . \nwe root for the captive of the cage-world . \nour protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \nthe story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \nalthough these questions came to mind , i don\'t think the film itself asked them . \nit certainly didn\'t address them or try to answer them . \ni was particularly disappointed that the film didn\'t deal more with the trauma of learning one\'s life is a tv show . \ncarrey\'s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman\'s pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film\'s pacing . \nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \nthe two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn\'t see it that way . \nperhaps it\'s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn\'t , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \nbut on its own terms , the movie is well made . \nsight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show . \nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . \none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \nthe music is well-chosen and scored . \nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman\'s world is still beautiful and perfect . \nwhen the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \nphilip glass\' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman\'s scenes of suspicion and awakening . \n ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \nand the pacing of the story was brisk . \nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman\'s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn\'t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \nthere\'s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \nit\'s a quick , straight shot to the movie\'s end . \nin terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol\'s gattaca . \nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . \nnevertheless , i look forward to niccol\'s next film , whatever it may be . \n',1

'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \nto be fair , i must admit that i\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \nperhaps it\'s because most of those i\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \nsurprised ? \nwell , so was i . \ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \nand so it goes . \nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \nlet\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \naction . \nthere\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\'s to be expected . \nhowever , this isn\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \nthere\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\'s father\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \nit\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \nthe picture is crisp and clear . \none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\'s to be expected in this type of film . \nif you like this kind of movie , you\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \n',1

'virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . \nsince \'dark city\' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . \nthe most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . \nall the films released after it , have been less successful . \ndavid cronenberg\'s existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . \nand when \'the thirteenth floor\' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . \ni admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . \nit was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to \'the thirteenth floor\' . \nhowever , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak\'s latest picture . \nmatrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood\'s action and effects with an intelligent story . \nexistenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . \n\'the thirteenth floor\' is somewhere in between . \ninstead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , \'the thirteenth floor\' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . \nin a near future . . . on \nthe thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . \nright after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . \ndouglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . \na beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . \nthe first \" download into simulation \" is impressive . \nit is the creator\'s first visit to his world , his creation . \nin order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone\'s identity , become another person . \nthis is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people \" wake up \" in unknown places and strange things start happen . \nthey start to doubt in their own sanity . \nthese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their \" users \" and creators with their sanity and their lives . \nit is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone\'s fantasy . \nwith an appealing ( \" blade runner \" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . \nour modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . \nthe thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . \nthis contrast demonstrates a wish for change . \nvirtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . \nto some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . \nfor others - a way to start over and \" correct \" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . \nvirtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . \nat least that\'s how it is all beginning . \nbut when you\'re waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . \nthis , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . \nsome important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? \nwhat is thought ? \nwho are we ? \nif these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . \nthey are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . \nthe visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . \nkirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . \nthere are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose\'s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . \na rather unusual thing about\'the thirteenth floor\' is the almost complete lack of special effects . \nthere are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . \nthis is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . \nthis is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and \'dark city\'-fans will be pleased . \nthis film is interesting and inspiring . \nit has everything existenz doesn\'t , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . \nand then there is a happy end which , like in \'dark city\' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . \nthe plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and \'dark city\' . \nwith this in mind , \'the thirteenth floor\' doesn\'t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . \n',1
'much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of \" lolita , \" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it\'s important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit . \nwhen seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well , \nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution . \nwhat\'s even worse is that seeing this \" lolita , \" especially the first time and if you\'re familiar with anything \" lolita , \" is admittingly very anticlimactic . \nthis is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it\'s really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : \" flashdance , \" \" fatal attraction , \" and \" indecent proposal \" ) , at least besides \" jacob\'s ladder . \" \ni\'ve seen this \" lolita \" twice : the first time , i wasn\'t so blown away . \nit seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting . \nthe second time , not really thinking about how i\'ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i\'m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally . \nthe story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it\'s such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . \nthe story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it\'s not trash for the perverted but because it\'s about human obsession with things that are out of one\'s reach . \nits protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . \nthe character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can\'t live without . \nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . \nthe focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . \nthe tone of the book is a comical one , but it\'s also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . \nhumbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . \nwe get a sense that perhaps it\'s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . \nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . \nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . \nthe story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . \nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . \nthe opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn\'t done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? \nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn\'t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . \nin that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . \nthe studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and \nwhen you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . \nthe censors wouldn\'t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . \nlooking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we\'ve read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it\'s really impossible to compare them . \nthey both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . \nand although it\'s true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it\'s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . \ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won\'t say that here . \nhowever , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . \nit doesn\'t have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . \nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads . \njeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . \nhe\'s droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . \nhe brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . \nand when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he\'s her prisoner for as long as he lives . \nand dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . \nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . \nit\'s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . \nwhen he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . \nthere are two other minor characters in the film , one who\'s a road block in the beginning , and the other who\'s a reappearing threat to the relationship . \nthe former is charlotte , lolita\'s mother , played by melanie griffith . \nin the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . \nand she\'s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . \nas played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she\'s about half of them . \nit\'s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . \nand even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she\'s nothing more . \nthe other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . \nlangella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . \nquilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . \nlangella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . \nas you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . \nthis version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening . \nthe camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . \nthe acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . \nmore importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . \nby the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn\'t regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have . \n',1
'for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro . \nif the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house . \nthat extra motive doesn\'t make happy gilmore a funnier movie . \nit doesn\'t really add any genuine emotional depth , either . \nin fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . \nbut sandler\'s philosophy seems to be , if it\'s a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? \nthat is endlessly refreshing . \nin the wedding singer , sandler is right on track . \nthe fact that he\'s a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story . \nwhat kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important . \ndavid spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm . \nhe could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact . \nbut sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character . \nhe seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family . \nrobbie hart ( sandler ) doesn\'t just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing . \nhe is exactly the man you would want at your wedding . \nthe day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) . \nrobbie takes it hard . \nhe doesn\'t sleep , he doesn\'t eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings \" love stinks \" at a wedding . \njulia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to . \neventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia . \nhe really likes her , but she\'s engaged . \nher fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn\'t deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand . \njulia seems to like robbie too , but she can\'t leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her . \nyou know the story . \nyou\'ve seen it a million times before . \nthere\'s always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it\'s the same story . \nand sometimes , it works . \nthe wedding singer works . \nfirst of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective . \nactually , it\'s not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one\'s own romantic tension . \nsandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love . \nbarrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with . \nsparks don\'t fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other . \nsecond , their love is mature . \nthey are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they\'re a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material . \ninstead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with . \nat a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by . \nthe repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child . \nthe ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie . \nother critics liked this movie in part because of the \'80s soundtrack . \ni liked it in spite of the soundtrack . \noften , the music and references felt forced . \nfor example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to \" get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . \" \n ( ha ha ha . \nget it ? \ndavid lee roth did leave van halen ! ) \nor how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie\'s chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove . \n ( that\'s exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) . \nunfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding . \nthat\'s not to say the movie isn\'t funny . \nscreenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination . \nherlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style . \nlet\'s hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over . \nwith barrymore\'s charm and sandler\'s heart , it was hard to go wrong . \n',1
'i\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\'t do that . \nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\'t quite do that either . \na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\'s \" dr . \nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\'t do that . \nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \nstill , even with the cia\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \ni think it\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\'t even real ? \nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \n',1
' \" gattaca \" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it\'s a genre picture that doesn\'t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . \nthe movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . \nthis allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they\'d like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . \nthose made the old-fashioned way are labeled as \" in-valids \" and confined to the lower rung of society . \nvincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . \nfed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . \neveryday , he watches as \" superior \" folk make his fantasy a reality . \ndetermined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . \nhis counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . \nfor a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . \nbecause of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she\'s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn\'t know is a lie . \nbut on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . \ntwo ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate\'s loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent\'s eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent\'s cover and derail his goal . \neven if \" gattaca \" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film\'s look is dazzling without ever being flashy . \nfirst-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama \" the truman show \" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . \nan opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . \nniccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . \nwhen it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . \nethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . \nhis chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting\'s clinical chill . \nas the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it\'s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . \nin \" gattaca \" \'s series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . \nthings get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent\'s relationship with his brother comes back into view . \nthe big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . \nstill , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it\'s successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it\'s a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it\'s a futuristic fable without blood and guts . \neven its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . \nalthough it\'s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , \" gattaca \" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . \n',1
'the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man\'s life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . \nthematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni\'s neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . \nthrough a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . \nlife * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . \nliving in 1930\'s italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \nalthough dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . \nunfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . \nit is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie\'s theme of family love becomes the strongest . \nalthough prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son\'s happiness . \nnow , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . \nbenigni\'s performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . \nthe supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . \nlife is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . \nin certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a \" saturday night live \" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie\'s second half the script\'s circular nature becomes admirably obvious . \ncharacters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot\'s outcome . \nin all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first \" artsy \" film . \nlife is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . \n',1
'>from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) \ncomes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida\'s south coast . \nplot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . \nshe happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . \nthe counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . \nas the story unfolds , we find that many things aren\'t exactly as they seem ( that\'s as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . \ncritique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . \nmind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes \" one too many \" twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . \nand besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even \" explained \" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it \nreally does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . \nother than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her \" good girl stereotypical \" role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . \ndenise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood\'s jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn\'t lead to lawsuits . \nbacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . \nsprinkle the story with a bunch o\' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you\'ve got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . \non the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , \ni almost forgot bill murray\'s exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . \nmurray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . \nlittle known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she\'s also born in guelph , ontario . . . go \nhoser ! ) \ndirector john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . \nkevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called \" six degrees of kevin bacon \" . \n',1
'what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . \nsometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . \nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes . \nterence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . \nunlike this year\'s saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . \nwhile that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . \nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . \none message is not necessarily more correct than the other . \nit just depends on one\'s point of view . \nin malick\'s film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll\'s cinematography is beyond lush . \nthe setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? \nin saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . \nin the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . \nthey are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . \nall that separates them is war . \nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . \nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . \ndispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . \ninstead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . \naside from that , malick\'s direction is stunning . \nthe tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . \nsean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . \npenn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . \njohn travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . \nultimately however , the thin red line\'s interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . \nit has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . \nhas no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? \nwhat malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking . \n',1
'when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . \nwhen the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . \nwhen han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . \ncool . \n_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . \nwas it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? \nhave we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? \nit sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . \ndetermined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . \nit is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . \nwhen lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . \nbut the joy in a film like this is in the little details . \nfor example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . \nif he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . \nit means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . \nit means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . \nhomer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . \nhere he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . \nthis is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . \nhe is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . \nbut he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . \nthrough coal-mining . \nbecause of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . \nthe revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . \nwe don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . \nthe paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . \nso _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . \nand this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . \nbtw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . \nanother commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago . \n',1
'the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . \nin this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . \nthis movie closely resembles a james bond flick . \nit has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . \nkilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . \nthe movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . \nas a young boy , kilmer\'s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . \nthat is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . \nhe refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . \nthis leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . \nkilmer\'s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . \nduring a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . \nonce his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . \nwhen he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . \ndr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . \nthis new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . \nthe only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . \nthis presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . \ntretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . \none of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . \nthey are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . \nkilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue\'s character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . \nwhen the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer\'s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer\'s alter-ego , a traveling artist . \nyet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . \nshue\'s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . \nwhen she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . \nthe saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . \nthe sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . \nalong the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . \nthese moments are almost always thanks to kilmer\'s extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . \nall in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . \n',1
'capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . \nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetback\'s baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that\'s the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . \na young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . \nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that\'s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we\'re not used to seeing on screen . \nthis is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . \n ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) \nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded . \nsweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . \nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . \nin other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . \nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( \" by an all-white jury \" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it\'s hardly surprising why . \nthere\'s a good deal of sex in the movie , but it\'s handled in a way that\'s unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . \nin one scene , sweetback visits a friend\'s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . \nwe\'re not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . \nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles\' hands . \none scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . \nanother note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one\'s own mind . \nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows . \n',1
'while alex browning ( devon sawa ) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris , bad omens seem to surround him . \nas soon as he buckles into the plane , he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take-off . \nwhen the vision begins to come true , alex bolts for the door , dragging several students and a teacher in his wake . \nthe plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted . \nhe becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community , and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die . \nalex and another survivor , clear rivers ( ali larter ) , investigate the suspicious \" suicide \" of a friend , and a mortician ( tony \" candyman \" todd ) clues them in to the truth : alex interrupted death\'s design by saving people who should have died in the explosion , and death will want to claim its rightful victims . \nin order to save himself and the others , alex will have to figure out death\'s new plan and thwart it . \nof the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the \" scream \" audience , \" final destination \" is the best so far . \ntalented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula . \nwe\'ve seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one-by-one by a faceless slasher , but reddick cuts out the hockey-masked middle-man and makes the villain death itself . \nfirst-time feature director james wong made the most of that premise . \nevery scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding , reminding us that death is everywhere , can come at anytime . \neveryday objects and events vibrate with menace . \nthe most amusing harbinger of doom : john denver\'s \" rocky mountain high , \" which is played several times in the movie before someone dies . \n ( the link is that denver died in a plane crash , and the song includes a line about fire in the sky . ) \nthe performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror . \ndevon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , \" idle hands , \" gives a frantic and convincing lead performance . \nkerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex\'s whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane . \nsmith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence . \nseann william scott , who\'s also in theaters right now in \" road trip , \" plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter . \ntony todd\'s one-scene cameo is delicious but all too brief . \nbottom line : watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between , but this destination is worth visiting . \n',1
'there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason . \n \" good will hunting \" is about one of those people . \nthe will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let\'s face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius . \nhe can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino . \nand he works at mit . . . as the janitor . \none day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( \" breaking the waves \" \'s stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete . \nthe next day , it\'s already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it . \nso lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove . \nand , duh , it\'s done again . \nof course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will . \nbefore lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy . \nafter going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , \" afternoon delight \" ) . \nfinally , lambeau\'s old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up . \nturns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not . \nit also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge . \nand that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction . \nis it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? \nshould this guy be forced to do something he doesn\'t want to do ? \nthis appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . \ni\'m not saying \" good will hunting \" is a bad film at all . \nit\'s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . \nthe acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . \nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will\'s love interest , skylar . \nthere are tons of individual moments that i adored . \ni loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . \ni liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . \nthere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . \nand there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . \nlike the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean\'s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn\'t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . \nhowever , the main flaw of the film is there\'s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . \nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they\'re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . \ntake for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . \nwe hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . \nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . \nalso , will\'s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . \nwe see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . \ntheir relationship never goes beyond \" just best friends , \" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . \nmaybe it was just me . \nand it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . \nand , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . \nwe never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it\'s there for plot details that anything else . \nminnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . \nthe writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . \nsure , it feels overstuffed , but it\'s extremely enjoyable . \nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . \ni think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . \nwhile this is probably director gus van sant\'s most conservative film ( you\'d hardly know it\'s the same director of \" to die for , \" the only van sant film i\'ve seen , really ) , it\'s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what\'s this \" best picture \" deal ? ) . \nand if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone . \n',1

'unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi\'s lover at the time ) freely admits that he \" couldn\'t care less about the truth \" but was more interested in capturing \" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \" \ndespite violating nearly every rule of \" legitimate \" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he\'s funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \" it\'s about women not wanting to look like cows \" ) to mary tyler moore ( \" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \" ) to style ( \" it\'s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \" ) . \nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \nit\'s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi\'s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience\'s perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \nwhile unzipped isn\'t an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \nwhen the designer declares that \" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that\'s beautiful and liberating , \" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \n',1
'life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless . \nit combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . \nit\'s an italian film , but don\'t let that discourage you . \nsubtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . \nlife is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . \nthe year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \ntheir romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she\'s already engaged to another man . \ncan guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? \nwhat do you think ? \nhowever , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . \nthe fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . \nunable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . \nhe pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . \nas you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . \nas a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . \nas a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . \nroberto benigni\'s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin\'s , and it is easy to see why . \nhe is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero\'s \" triumph of the underdog \" spirit . \nlife is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . \nhowever , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . \nwith life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . \nit\'s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i\'ve had at the movies this year . \n',1

'while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year\'s masterpiece fight club . \nboth films consist of a predominately male cast . \nboth films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . \nand both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . \nwhile boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . \na generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . \npaying homage to oliver stone\'s 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . \nas is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . \nboiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . \nanother similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . \nsome people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . \nif you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . \nif you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . \ngiovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film\'s narrator , seth . \nafter dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . \nhe agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . \nlearning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . \nafter stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . \nat this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . \nribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth\'s dad . \nthe two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . \nthe transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . \nthe supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . \nben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . \nthe energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . \nthe only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . \nthere is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . \ndue to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . \nthe movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn\'t funny enough to make it a comedy . \nin having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . \nit doesn\'t seem to know which category to fit itself into . \none satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . \notherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . \n',1
'after a stylistic detour with mrs . \nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph\'s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \nuntil mrs . \nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \nin short , rudolph has created a world that it\'s worth spending two hours in . \nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \nall she\'s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she\'s ovulating . \nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they\'re no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won\'t allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn\'t take long before they\'re lounging together , naked , in her pool . \nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it\'s an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it\'s a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it\'s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it\'s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \nlara flynn boyle , who wasn\'t impressive in rudolph\'s equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph\'s most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film\'s humor , and there\'s hardly ever a moment when she doesn\'t steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \ni don\'t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director\'s earlier productions . \nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that\'s the real reason to see this motion picture . \nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \n',1
'until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie . \nforget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i\'ve seen so far this year . \neven though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there\'s a not drop of blood to be seen . \nluckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton\'s first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001 . \nso , there\'s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place . \nrobert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash . \nhis newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere . \npowell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he\'s released and ben is hanged . \nbut finding the money isn\'t easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren\'t telling . \nthe hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time . \nhow many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? \nwhat about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? \n ( no , i\'m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . ) \nyes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter . \npowell\'s \" love \" and \" hate \" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) . \nand powell\'s black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino\'s early visual style . \nseeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact . \nyou can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club . \nhe plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears . \nhe\'s like the senior class president with an evil streak . \nif i ever need to stay awake , i\'ll just picture him crooning , \" leaning . . . \nleaning . . . . \" \nany actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah . \nand credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop . \nit\'s a testament to both men that they\'re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we\'re more scared by what we don\'t see . \nscreenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who\'s haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act . \nthe only lapse is the movie\'s third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) . \nher showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns . \nhowever , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it\'s still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun . \ndo yourself favor and don\'t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater . \nnote : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie . \nthe highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters\' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile . \nhours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling . \nscreened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) . \n',1
'steven spielberg\'s \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . \nfirst , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . \nsecond , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \nlast , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \n \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . \ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti-slavery \" movie . \nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn\'t already know about it . \nfortunately , i turned out to be wrong . \nfor one thing , spielberg\'s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders\' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . \nand some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . \none scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . \nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . \nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . \nexposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . \nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . \nthe biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . \nthrough cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . \ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \n \" what kind of country is this , where laws \'almost\' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \nspielberg\'s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque\'s angry outburst in the court room . \nstill , there isn\'t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can\'t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \nthis summer\'s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \n \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . \nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \nhowever , i can\'t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \n',1
'driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story . \nit\'s a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film . \nbut if you\'re patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy . \ndriving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry\'s pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago . \nthe play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union . \nuhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn\'t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta\'s history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city\'s oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it\'s about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke\'s good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \nwe\'ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie\'s gentle humor . \nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy\'s loving and patient son . \ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy\'s housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie\'s pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he\'s shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film\'s dramatic moments . \nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \n',1
'eric rohmer\'s \" pauline at the beach , \" is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally . \nthe film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) . \non the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) . \nwhile pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) . \n \" pauline at the beach , \" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story . \ninstead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn\'t for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . \nthis is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969\'s \" my night at mauds , \" and 1971\'s \" claire\'s knee \" ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote . \n \" pauline at the beach , \" is a film worth seeing . \n',1
'not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . \nlike bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters\' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . \nalso like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters\' ravished and wracked faces . \nand the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman\'s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . \nall that is missing is a discussion of god . \nwhich is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . \nin fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . \nnonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film\'s rhythms . \nonce the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . \none such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . \nthough leigh may have adopted some of bergman\'s stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple\'s strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any \" style \" at all . \nwhereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . \nthe effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . \nit is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . \nmuch has been made of brenda blethyn\'s performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . \nthere are a few missteps . \nfor one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . \nthis leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . \nand occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . \nfor all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . \nit is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . \nin fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . \nthere is even a sweet but significant irony in the film\'s unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . \nnonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . \nthough there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . \nneedless to say , it is also very depressing at times . \nbut for many of us , of course , so is life . \nand though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better . \n',1
'david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head . \nit is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . \nthe story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . \nthe world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are \" hiding \" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world . \nallegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group . \nas they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun . \nshe flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard . \nunfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged . \nto inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her . \nthe events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn\'t exist , as the \" players \" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot . \nhere the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game\'s perspective . \ni don\'t intend to reveal more of the film\'s premise , which is structured as a computer game , with \" tasks \" that the characters must complete to win the game . \nreleased after \" the matrix \" and \" dark city \" , \" existenz \" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films . \nhowever , \" existenz \" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own . \na combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made \" the matrix \" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . \n \" existenz \" has a completely different atmosphere , resembling \" dark city \" , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining . \n \" existenz \" has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . \nafter the engaging beginning , it starts to falter . \nwhile i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour . \nand indeed , \" existenz \" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another . \nbut the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes . \nand jet the film fails on several issues . \nprobably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life . \nthis is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg\'s script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown . \nexistenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies . \nit is not a world worth sacrificing your life for . \nit\'s a cold , dark place where the \" players \" are forced to interrelate with unreal characters , eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will . \nit doesn\'t look like a place worth even thinking about . \ndavid cronenberg has been the creator of \" the fly \" , \" videodrome \" and \" the dead zone \" , so it\'s not so hard to guess that \" existenz \" is a violent and gory film . \nbesides the regular murders of innocent people , the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium . \nscenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can\'t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures . \nthe way i see it , this is the film\'s crucial failure . \nit is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time , space and problems of our everyday life do not exist ; a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . \nbecause of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . \nduring the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . \n \" the matrix \" , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . \n \" existenz \" does not . \nit is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . \n',1
'your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people , who hop in and out of bed with each other . \nwritten and directed by neil labute , who\'s first film , \" in the company of men \" was simply marvelous , disappoints a bit here with this one . \nthe story involves two couples ( ben stiller & catherine keener and aaron eckhart & amy brenneman ) , an artist assistant ( nastassja kinski ) , and an egotistical women abuser ( jason patric ) . \nthe character\'s names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie . \neach of the characters has their own sexual style and they don\'t seem to \" merge \" together well . \nso the group experiments behind their respective partners back . \nthere are some hysterical scenes , one involves jason patric , aaron eckhart , and ben stiller\'s characters . \nthey are all in a sauna , talking about their best \" lay \" , when jason patric\'s character makes a surprising confession . \nthe whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted . \nthe enjoyed this movie , although it seemed a tad lengthy ( even though it only runs 99 min . ) . \nthe film\'s cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener , aaron eckhart , and jason patric . \ni would not recommend this film , to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit . \nit did seem to offend people , more than half of the people in the theater left during the film . \nalthough your friends and neighbors doesn\'t have the power of labute\'s earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny , while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relationships . \n',1
'do film critics have morals ? \nare there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? \nnaturally we don\'t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . \nsecondly , and along the same line , we can\'t prejudge a film because of it\'s stars , director , etc . the difference ? \nwell , in the first one , we\'d go into a film thinking it\'s going to be dumb or it\'s going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i\'m not expecting much ) . \non the second hand , we\'re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal \" grudge \" against the film company ( it\'s made by disney ? \noh , it\'s just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey\'s in it ? \nit\'s gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? \ncan\'t be that good ) . \nthis is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . \nmake sense ? \nok , but what about comparing ? \nisn\'t that kind of along the same lines ? \nwhen we compare a certain actor or director or even composer\'s credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? \nsure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? \nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? \ni think it is , and i\'ll tell you why . \na good critic should be able to view the film from the \" average joe ( or jane ) \" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . \nsometimes that can be tough . \n \" the acting was superb , but i was bored \" or \" i loved it ! ! \nit was sooooo cheezy ! \" \nmight be used to describe a film . \nthese are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . \nbut which is more important ? \nand which is better ? \nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? \ngetting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we\'re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . \nevery average person out there who\'s interested in this film is likely to ask \" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? \" \nand so , as a critic , i\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \ntarantino\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \n ( we\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\'d hope , he posts jackie\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \nordell won\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \ncoming into play is another 70\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \nmax\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \nalso involved is ordell\'s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\'t need a de niro to play him . \ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\'t as awesome as the first time . \njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\'t think he\'s quite as irreplaceable . \nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \njackson could\'ve remained tarantino\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \nthis is grier\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino\'s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard\'s novel \" rum punch \" . \nfor those movie-goers , don\'t expect another pulp fiction and you\'ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90\'s film- making . \nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we\'re still reminded that this is tarantino\'s movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn\'t pulp fiction at all . \nit\'s good , but it isn\'t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won\'t satiate true fans . \nif you can realize that this isn\'t going to knock your socks off , then you\'ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \n',1
'elmore leonard has quickly become one of hollywood\'s favorite authors . \nout of four film adaptations in as many years , the witty and inventive out of sight gives get shorty a run for its money as the best leonard adaptation around . \ngeorge clooney stars as jack foley , a nice bank robber . . . you \nknow the type , he uses his charm and his wits rather than a gun . \nbut even charming guys end up unlucky , and jack ends up in jail . \nbut not for long . \nhe plots an escape with the help of his best friend , and fellow robber , buddy bragg ( ving rhames ) , and their slow-witted pothead associate , glenn michaels ( steve zahn ) . \nbut jack didn\'t count on u . s . marshal karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) . \nappearing at the right place at the wrong time , karen gets involved in foley\'s escape attempt and the subsequent manhunt to bring him in . \nhowever , karen develops a rapport with jack foley , and finds that she begrudgingly likes the guy . \nbut , can love prosper on opposite sides of the law ? \nor can karen straighten out jack before he goes too far in pursuit of just one last crime . \nclooney , who has had a string of solid , but never stellar , film roles , delivers his best performance to date . \nhe blends into his role here perfectly as the risk taking jack foley , who\'s willing to gamble everything on the chance that karen sisco might be his true love . \njennifer lopez does an excellent job as well . \nshe actually has a trickier role than clooney , as a woman who has to balance her emotions with her sense of duty . \nshe and clooney develop good chemistry together . \nthe film boasts a superb ensemble . \nsteve zahn gives a hilarious performance , and steals nearly every scene he\'s in . \ndon cheadle is appropriately sinister as a violent ex-con who may or may not be teaming up with foley . \nalbert brooks is enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much for his own good . \nout of the cast , only dennis farina seems underused as karen\'s ex-lawman father . \nsteven soderbergh gives the film sharp and stylistic direction . \nwith an affectation for freeze frames , he delivers a unique take on the film\'s action and love scenes that places out of sight a notch above routine crime films . \na recurring series of flashbacks makes the film seem more complex than it actually is . \ndevoid of its bells and whistles , out of sight is actually a fairly straightforward crime story . \nhowever , there are only a few spots in the film that seem bare , and they pass quickly . \nwith smart dialogue , good characters , and an excellent cast , out of sight easily smoothes over the rough spots in the plot and delivers on both the action and romantic fronts . \n',1
'this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . \nthere are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood\'s most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . \nthis is the best we\'ve seen from disney since \" beauty and the beast \" ( 1996 ) . \nthis film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . \nin the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their \" lives \" . \none day , andy broke woody\'s arm off , while playing with him . \nwoody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . \nlater andy\'s mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son\'s room . \nsince one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . \nalthough his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . \nthe cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , \" woody\'s roundup . \" \nif he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . \nso , after andy\'s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it\'s up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . \nand so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . \nthere are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . \nmeanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . \nthey offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . \nhe is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . \nthe problem is , if woody escapes from al\'s clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . \na real effort is made in the technical department . \nthe animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the \" cinematography \" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . \nlighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie\'s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on \" jurassic park \" and \" star wars \" . \nthe film ends with the \" failed takes \" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . \nthese outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . \nbut what in the end makes \" toy story 2 \" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . \nit is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . \nit is not difficult to predict that \" toy story 2 \" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . \nunexpected because the first film wasn\'t much more than a demonstration of special effects . \nbut mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn\'t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . \nbut here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . \nthis is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . \noff course , this is not \" antz \" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you\'ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . \nwhether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . \nmy choice would probably be \" the iron giant \" , but ( along side with \" american pie \" ) this is the comedy of the year . \ni almost lost my hopes for disney , but \" toy story 2 \" proves that disney hasn\'t lost their ability to entertain . \n',1
'i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price . \nas the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking . \njason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school\'s clubs and organizations ( i . e . \nthe fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion . \nthis stunt , building an aquarium on the school\'s baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) . \nhe funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross . \nrosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross . \nherman manages to destroy max\'s bike , while max cuts herman\'s brakes , and it goes on like this . \nbut eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can\'t stand in the way of two people in love . \nthe academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn\'t an accident ) . \nit maybe wasn\'t best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray\'s absense from the ballot is a complete snub . \nthe entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it\'s fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic . \nthe cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well . \ni hope rushmore can overcome its\' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers . \n',1
'he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother . \nshe inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus . \nhe has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother\'s phrases . \nhe is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door . \nhe is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit . \nhe is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears . \nhis father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion . \nunsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way \" his \" boy has turned out . \nhe is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts . \nsoon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest . \nbubby\'s relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable . \nthe father\'s arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom . \nbubby intuits from his father\'s arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind . \nso far , so good . \nthe first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant . \nthe movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby\'s hermetic two-room universe . \nit follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins . \nit is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby\'s , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes . \nhe observes what it might be like . \nthe intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch\'s eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack . \nfor thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own . \nthen de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers . \nour unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives . \nhe is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) . \n . \n . \nit goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once . \nde heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again . \nthe scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby\'s experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother\'s walls , bubby dons a priest\'s collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel . \nthe manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby\'s mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him . \nalthough de heer\'s touch is at times overbearing , bubby\'s salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope . \na hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . \nhe returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . \ninnocence triumphs . \nbubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . \nit\'s a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn\'t be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain\'t like other movies . \n',1
'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \npatrice lumumba\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\'s and 60\'s . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\'s life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n',1
'ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood \nsynopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel . \nin the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham\'s snobbish adopted daughter , estella . \nthe gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class \" gentleman . \" \npip leaves for london with \" great expectations \" to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella . \nbut life has a way of complicating things . \npip becomes an arrogant s . o . b . \nuntil he learns just who his secret benefactor is . \nin this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) . \nbut soon the focus of finn\'s life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment . \nestella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man-hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage . \nthis causes estella to \'fear the daylight\' of relationships , but finn thinks it\'s just a case of snobbery . \nwhen finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist . \nfinn leaves florida with \" great expectations \" to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella . \nwhat will happen to all of finn\'s \" great expectations ? \" \nopinion : if you\'re looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no further ; you\'ve found one here . \nethan hawke is romantic lead . \n ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites . \nhe romanced julie delpy in before sunrise . \nhe romanced uma thurman in gattaca . \nnow in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . ) \nhawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film . \nmeanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella\'s whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate . \nanne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably . \nthe difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease . \n',1

'there\'s good news and bad news about mulan . \nthe positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . \non the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . \nbut mulan is a step in the right direction and disney\'s best animated feature since the lion king . \nafter giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . \nmulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . \nthat\'s what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . \ncartoons . . . \nmeanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . \nsince mulan\'s a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . \nshe pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . \nthat\'s chinese culture for you . . . \nso imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father\'s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . \nthe movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . \nit should have been called g . i . \nchang . \nmulan calls on her ancestors for help . \nthey decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . \nvoiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . \nmurphy\'s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they\'re going to have . \nyou ain\'t never had a friend like mushu . \nspeaking of songs , mulan doesn\'t have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . \ndisney songs about war probably wouldn\'t go over too well ( \" heigh ho , heigh ho , it\'s off to war i go . . . \" ) , and the ones they do have aren\'t memorable . \nthe best of the bunch , sad to say , is \" be a man , \" the requisite basic training montage song . \nyes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . \nsung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , \" be a man \" accompanies footage of mulan\'s platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . \nit makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that\'s ended badly ? \ni only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . \nfor the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . \nall she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . \nthe deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . \nbut she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . \nas a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . \ni saw the movie yesterday and i don\'t remember the man\'s name . \notherwise , mulan is a good movie . \nthe animation of the characters themselves isn\'t as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . \neddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . \nhell , george \" mr . sulu \" takei does a voice in mulan . \nyou get the sense disney said to themselves , \" alright , let\'s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . \nwho can you think of ? \" \n \" well , there\'s mr . myagi . . . \" \n \" good . \" \n \" and mr . sulu . \" \n \" perfect . \nwe\'ve got ourselves a movie now . \" \nsoon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind . \n',1
' \" it\'s not good to know too much about someone , charlie , \" charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin . \ncharlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her \" soul mate \" as she calls him since her mother gave her his name . \nthere\'s a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east . \nmark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt . \nand to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . \nthe story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police . \njohn gay\'s script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . \nkaren arthur\'s direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense . \nwhen supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma , they don\'t know about his nefarious activities . \nhe showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway . \ntwo mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the \" average american family , \" but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background . \ncharlie , who first welcomed her uncle\'s visit , begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters . \nthe picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers . \nthe beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other . \nshe wants him to leave , and he doesn\'t want to go , what with a local , rich widow as a prospective victim . \nwill charles kill charlie first , or will she get him out of town . \nharmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped . \nwith a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth\'s sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . \nmy only quibble is the director\'s awkward staging of the final scene on the train . \nis hitchcock\'s version better ? \nof course . \nis this one worth watching as well ? \nactually , yes . \nshadow of a doubt runs 1 : 40 . \nit is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up . \n',1
'as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you\'ve got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . \ni am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world\'s biggest paid commercial for america online . \nand i wonder : is that so bad ? \nwell , the commercial part is . \nas for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i\'ll be okay . \nto paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act . \nthey are both wonderful , but for all of hanks\' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he\'s suitably obnoxious . \ntom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he\'s going to get the girl : the only question is how ? \nmeg ryan , america\'s high school sweetheart , can act . \nshe\'s had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don\'t , get the movie-- fantastic ) . \nbut , i like her best when she\'s , well , perky . \nshe is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . \nsome people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don\'t really know . \nall i know is that i just like them both . \nthey have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that\'s really hard to resist , and i\'m not going to even try . \nthey\'re just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . \nhanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . \nhere , the setup is a little different . \nkathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children\'s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . \nshe is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . \nshe is also having an affair , of sorts . \nyou see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . \nthey have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . \nny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . \nfox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children\'s bookseller named \" shop around the corner \" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . \nevery morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight \" to the death ! ! \" . \nit\'s a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . \nit also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no \" let\'s have sex tonight \" mantra , if you\'ll excuse my bluntness . \nthis is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . \nhmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan \" hook up \" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . \nyou know it\'s going to happen , the question is now ? \nthankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . \nit\'s all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . \nhanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . \nhe is , i believe , america\'s greatest actor . \ndoes he show it here ? \nnah . \nbut he\'s still tom hanks , and she\'s still meg ryan . \nwhich is what this movie boils down to . \nit\'s pure confection . \nall the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it\'s all really sweet . \nthere are some immense flaws , like pacing . \nthe last third of the movie really doesn\'t work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it\'s slow . \nonce hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . \ni even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . \nthe other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . \ne-mail ? \nwhen my kids are my age , i don\'t know what we\'ll be using . \nbut hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . \nthey just work together , and it\'s nice to see . \nit gives you , well , a smile . \nthe script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . \ni was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . \ni\'ve always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . \nyou see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . \nmovies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i\'d rather not think about that . \ni always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . \nand i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . \nhanks was the driving force behind one of the year\'s best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . \nhe\'s also half of the glue behind the year\'s best example of pure entertainment . \ntom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . \nit\'s a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . \nit may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . \n',1
'in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can\'t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . \nthis is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . \nold friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . \nthrough process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . \nwhat results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit . \nafter all , old ned won\'t miss it . \nrather than divulge the later twists and turns , i\'ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . \nbannen and kelly are a perfect pair . \none slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . \nboth getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . \nwaking ned devine may even be seen as a \" full monty \" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene . \nwaking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . \nthe performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . \nthere is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture . \nwriter/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . \nscripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception . \nperhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . \nhad i held off on my year\'s best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year\'s finest films . \nit is light , but thought provoking and sweet . \ni can\'t think of anyone who shouldn\'t see ( or wouldn\'t enjoy ) this film . \n',1
'i feel no hesitation in saying that \" there\'s something about mary \" is the best film that i will see all year . \nfrom the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . \nit is that good of a film . \nwhen gene siskel said this about \" fargo \" only a few months into \'96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . \nhow could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? \nbut after seeing the farrelly\'s hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . \nonce in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . \nand you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . \nnow for the shocker ; \" mary \" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( \" pink flamingos \" obviously notwithstanding ) . \nthe movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . \nforget \" blazing saddles \" , \" animal house \" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , \" monty python\'s meaning of life \" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly\'s assault on the senses . \nin fact , this may even be the funniest film i\'ve ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is \" monty python and the holy grail \" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . \nbut as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of \" mary \" ; it has a huge heart . \nyou see , the farrelly\'s are truly gifted filmmakers . \nthey don\'t just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . \nthey also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . \nit\'s funny , though . \nif you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . \nbut believe me , it is anything but . \nben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . \nafter he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . \nearly brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from \" scream \" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . \nin one of the film\'s funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won\'t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . \njump to the present . \nafter years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . \nhealy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . \nadmittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . \nafter all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? \nsomehow , the farrelly\'s pull it off . \nthe performances here are also right on target . \nas ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . \nand cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary\'s brother . \nno other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . \ni know he won\'t be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . \nas good as the actors are , though , it\'s the directors\' movie all the way . \ni guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg\'s wwii epic \" saving private ryan \" . \nand yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . \nbut which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can\'t breath for minutes at a time ? \ni\'ll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . \nthere is just something about \" mary \" . \n',1
'the rich man\'s wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn\'t be enjoying yourself . \nbut somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things . \nnot that it\'s bad , it\'s just that it\'s been done before ; and better , in my opinion . \ni realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it\'s probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ? \nthat\'s basically how i felt about this movie . \ni mean , it\'s not very good , but it\'s not completely bad either . \nthe wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) . \nshe is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you \nknow , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn\'t give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) . \nthus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) . \nnear the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods . \nonce there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i\'m still not quite sure what line of work he\'s in ) . \nmaking the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars . \none night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) . \nthey have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal . \nafter learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to \" take care \" of the problem . \nmanaging to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband . \nbut then one night , cole shows up . . . \nand here is where the fun begins . \nfrom this point on , it\'s going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects . \nthis is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out . \nand for the most part , they\'re right ; the rich man\'s wife has nary one original bone in it\'s body . \nbut who cares ? \nif you\'re looking for good ol\' dumb suspense movie , you can\'t do much better than this . \nand if you suspense buffs aren\'t already sold , it has a killer of an ending too . \n',1
'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\'s the x-files . \nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\'s representative to another species . \nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \nthe two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80\% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \nthe film\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\' part more than anything else . \nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \ncontact doesn\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \n',1

'why do so many children\'s films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \ntoo many of those who write or direct for children\'s movies assume that the kids just can\'t handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \n \" the iron giant , \" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as \" the simpsons \" and \" king of the hill , \" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \n \" the iron giant \" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that\'s enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \nrealizing he can\'t just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can\'t keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth\'s house as a lodger . \nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \n \" the iron giant \" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn\' t talk down to its audience . \nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \nit\'s very similar to the spielberg classic \" e . t . , \' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of \" the iron giant . \" \nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg\'s film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one\'s ability to choose one\'s own fate . \nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won\'t give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after \" tarzan \" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you\'re watching a cartoon . \nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \nthe characters\' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv\'s \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn\'t ditched ) . \ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won\'t mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \nthe film isn\'t only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \nit\'s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \nthe film even takes some jabs at america\'s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \nit\'s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it\'s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \n',1
'synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife . \nleonard has only a few clues to the murderer\'s identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier . \nbecause of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself . \n \" memento \" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination . \nreview : \" memento \" is the sort of movie i wish i\'d written ; i can think of no higher praise than that . \ni am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this . \nan instant film noir classic , \" memento \" is virtually flawless . \nthe script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity . \nalthough the idea of starting at the \" conclusion \" of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the \" start \" is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence . \n \" memento \" is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre . \nand it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively . \nnolan\'s direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite \" memento \" \'s challenging gimmick . \nand to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion . \npierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano\'s teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality . \n \" memento \" may be the year\'s best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 . \n',1
'i\'ve noticed something lately that i\'ve never thought of before . \npseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \ni\'m not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we\'re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient\'s transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \nseth\'s adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it\'s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \nit\'s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \nthe two aren\'t very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual \" intelligently ditzy \" romantic comedy roles , and it\'s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . \nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . \nit\'s a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn\'t know quite how to get to it . \nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . \nbased on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . \nmost movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . \nnonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . \n',1
' \" living out loud , \" is the type of motion picture we don\'t often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . \njudith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . \nshe is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . \nshe cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . \njudith\'s life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . \nboth of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . \n \" living out loud , \" which was written by richard lagravenese ( \" the bridges of madison county \" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . \nthe three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . \none highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . \nsometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . \none sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . \nan older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . \nas the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . \ninstantly , we realize this was simply in judith\'s mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . \nholly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . \nhunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993\'s \" the piano , \" for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . \nshe finds the right note for each scene and holds it . \nand devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . \nusually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play . \ntopping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith\'s role model . \nanother joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , \" happy \" ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . \nthe last shot is an especially powerful image . \nnothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . \nthe relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . \nas we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . \nand as , \" living out loud , \" which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for . \n',1
'up until about a year ago , john travolta\'s career consisted of those \" look who\'s talking \" movies ( notice how they never called them look who\'s talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . \nbut somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . \nweird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named \" size isn\'t everything \" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . \nbut now travolta\'s back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . \nfour words : contract with the devil . \nand this has nothing to do with newt gingrich\'s \" contract with america . \" \nno , satan is much more humane . \nanyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . \nhow do i know ? \ni own the document in question . \namazing what you can buy at those collector\'s shops for a few hundred dollars , isn\'t it ? \nget shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . \nhe goes to collect some of the mafia\'s money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . \nsure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that\'s beside the point . \npalmer is determined to get hackman\'s next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . \nit doesn\'t take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from \" who\'s the boss ? \" \nto speechless . \nit works in this case , unlike \" who\'s the boss ? \" \nalthough it\'s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . \ncomplicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman\'s other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta\'s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . \nget shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . \nthis movie doesn\'t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i\'ve seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . \nget shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . \ni\'m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . \nare you getting this , shorty ? \n',1
'towards the middle of \" the sweet hereafter , \" a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight . \nthen , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field . \nit pauses for a moment before the \" field \" cracks under the bus\' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time . \ncompare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of \" titanic , \" when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you\'ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films . \nthe scene in \" the sweet hereafter \" epitomizes all that\'s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan\'s film . \nit\'s not sensational . \nwe don\'t see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about . \nthe bus doesn\'t explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces . \nit simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake . \nit\'s a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance . \nusing a non-linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy . \nfourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief . \nthe catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit . \nstephens , who \" doesn\'t believe in accidents , \" functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath . \nwhile stephens\' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss . \nhis self-destructive , drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years . \negoyan\'s attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry . \nmychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for \" the ice storm , \" contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles . \nequally impressive is paul sarossy\'s cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room . \n \" the sweet hereafter , \" while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go . \nit\'s a film of generous subtlety and emotion . \n',1

'notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . \nthe first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . \nif you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . \nstarring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan \nexotica is a film that grows on retrospection . \nexotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . \nall of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . \nthe director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . \nexotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . \nat the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . \nthe out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . \nsimilarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . \non a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . \nbut perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . \nexotica is very much worth seeing . \nit opened to critic\'s praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . \nin canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . \napart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . \nthe spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . \nbut if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . \nanalysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) \nwhat is behind the complex plot in exotica ? \nfirst , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . \nthe lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . \nthen we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . \nin that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other\'s people lives through a silver screen . \nexotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . \nexotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . \nin exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . \nsecond , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . \nthe strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . \nthe niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . \nthe pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . \na chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie . \n',1
'-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \nmatinee is not like that . \ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \nwhile mant ! \nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \nserves mostly as dante\'s homage to the b-films he loves . \nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \nthis isn\'t a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \nenjoy ! \n',1
'for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america\'s finest actresses . \nin her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison\'s largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well . \nthe film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina . \nthrough voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn\'t survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident . \nthat\'s just the beginning of her troubles . \nbone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come . \nanney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident . \nanney\'s brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill . \nglen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( \" when are you gonna make your daddy proud ? \ni\'ll tell you when - never ! \" \nhe\'s told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper . \nwhen anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour . \nthings turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment . \nwhile set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today\'s society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other . \nthe real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance . \nher work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone\'s performance stands up well . \nleigh\'s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she\'s not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character\'s moods in and out of explosive rage . \none can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away . \nof the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker\'s performance . \nthere\'s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance . \nstill , it cannot be denied that anne meredith\'s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power . \nhuston\'s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone . \nher sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective . \nhuston\'s talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile . \nthe film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience . \nperhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing . \n',1
'i\'ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . \nthe part of jeff \" the dude \" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . \nthe dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . \nhe\'s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . \nafter much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . \nthe dude assumes that these \" collection agents \" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . \nthe millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . \nhe wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . \ndude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . \ncomedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . \nit is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . \nnot only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . \nall the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . \neach person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . \nthe characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . \nit\'s not what they do that\'s funny , it\'s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . \nworth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that\'s jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who\'s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as \" vaginal ; \" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . \naside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . \npeople lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . \nthey sound natural . \ntaken with fargo , the coen brothers\' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . \nethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he\'s also good at technical directing . \nhe and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . \nperhaps \" beautiful \" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . \nbut the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . \nall around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . \noutstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . \n',1
'it has happened again . \na movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed . \nit is involving , suspenseful . . . \nit even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus . \nbut in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie . \nthe sixth sense is that movie . \nstarring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle . \neight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people . \nnot just in dreams . \nand not just as lifeless bodies . \nhe sees them walking around like regular people . \nand he sees them all the time . \ndr . malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him . \nhe recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself . \nif crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest . \nbut first he needs to gain cole\'s trust . \nthe boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . . \nnot crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . . \nabout his \" secrets . \" \ncrowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy . \nbruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development . \ncrowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won\'t communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn\'t some truth behind what the boy sees . \nmr . willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona . \neleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance . \nhe demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro . \nit is fine work for one of such a tender age . \nkeep your eye on this young man . \nthe supporting cast is also quite effective . \ntoni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can\'t understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe\'s once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe\'s ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor\'s failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable . \ntwenty-eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film\'s full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it . \nit is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended . \nin giving the sixth sense a favorable \" three star \" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading . \nthere is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the \" living dead . \" \nthe concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself . \nthe first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , \" thou shall not surely die , \" a direct contradiction of god\'s admonition . \nthat same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages . \nscriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . . \nan event which has not yet occurred . \ntherefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall sound . \nand then , you\'ll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens . \n',1
'every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . \ni don\'t necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i\'m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . \nusually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . \nit has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . \nthat\'s a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . \nwhat\'s more , it\'s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . \nprincess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside . \napparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) . \nher banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . \nthis development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall . \nhowever , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo . \nas a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . \nit takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing . \nbut it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . \nhe is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . \nwhile hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . \nhe also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a \" sensation \" at court . \nin one of the film\'s best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance . \nit is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in \" sensations , \" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . \nsocial commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . \nthe performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . \nher supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls\' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . \nonly john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess\'s identity . \nthe story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . \nit is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn\'t given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . \nwhen it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . \nprincess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . \nstill , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . \nit is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . \n',1
'since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller \" blood simple , \" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . \ntheir films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . \nin \" the big lebowski , \" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning \" fargo , \" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude . \nthe dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood\'s most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high . \nthe dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties . \nhe has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks . \nhe smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in . \none day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money . \nthe main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here . \nsuffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money . \nby the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski\'s daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in \" fargo . \" \n \" the big lebowski \" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers\' earlier efforts . \nit shares their previous films\' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies . \n \" lebowski \" has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made \" raising arizona \" such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of \" barton fink \" ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded \" the hudsucker proxy . \" \nthe film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , \" barton fink , \" \" the hudsucker proxy , \" and \" fargo . \" \ndeakins always gives the coens\' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude\'s main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball\'s point of view . \nif \" fargo \" was the coen brothers\' most restrained effort in years , \" the big lebowski \" marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking . \nit is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end . \nthe coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely \'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism . \nwith joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out . \ntheir talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light . \nthe coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it\'s not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet . \n',1
'if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tried his damnedest to play it straight , he wouldn\'t have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in \" i went down . \" \ngleeson , who\'s not dissimilar to the late \" saturday night live \" alumnus in terms of physical attributes , plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film . \nbunny is sent to county cork to \" retrieve \" one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french ( well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle ) . \nbunny is to accompany git hynes ( peter mcdonald ) , recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies . \nthat tom french is a mean bollocks . \nhe wants frank back . \nand a small matter of some ? 25 , 000 that tom\'s wife was supposed to have given to frank . \nfor this he won\'t break anyone\'s thumbs . \nmaybe . \ninventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach , \" i went down \" follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs , dimly-lit pubs , and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble . \nmcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , \" the butcher boy . \" \neven if you can\'t comprehend half of what they\'re saying , gleeson and mcdonald together make \" i went down \" a trip worth taking . \nthe film is in many ways reminiscent of another \" little \" independent feature , 1991\'s \" highway 61 . \" \nthat film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson\'s tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that\'ll make you laugh out loud . \nwitness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company . \nthat sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in \" highway 61 . \" \nwhat\'s also charming about \" i went down \" is how the relationship between buddy and git develops . \ntheir trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it\'s handled is neither sappy nor labored . \nthe only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom . \nit\'s a little too hollywood , and what makes \" i went down \" so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies . \nsure it\'s gritty--make that grubby--but it\'s also pretty goofy . \nalthough \" i went down \" emphasizes the comedic elements of dis-organized crime , there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter . \ndon\'t let these deter you , though ; \" i went down \" is a little gem . \nit\'s only playing at one philadelphia-area theater--and i suspect it won\'t be there for long--so catch it while you can . \n',1
'plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he\'s devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . \ncritique : i\'m a sucker for movies like this . \na young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . \nin the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . \nhis entry and adaptation to the whole \" rock \'n roll \" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . \nalthough i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . \nmetal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn\'t that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . \nthat\'s not to say that you won\'t like this film if you don\'t like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . \nbut the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . \nwow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film\'s original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . \nhe is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . \nhe came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . \naniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn\'t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . \ni was also impressed by some of the \" real \" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . \nit\'s to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . \njust for the record , i\'m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it\'s a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . \noh yeah , and for those who dig the \" heavier \" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! \nyou see . . . dreams \ncan come true . . . \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \nalmost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) \n',1
'in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer . \nthe film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year\'s 100 million dollar grossing scream . \nwhen the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up . \ndid it live up to the first film ? \nthe answer is no . \njennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before . \nshe has been so upset since the incident . \nnightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on . \nshe know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle . \nkarla\'s boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food\'s mekhi phifer . \nfreddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie\'s boyfriend from a year ago . \none morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil . \nof course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas . \njulie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie . \nafter they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island . \nit starts off as the weekend of their dreams . \nsomething just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie\'s life though . \nben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn\'t letting anyone survive this time . \nwill ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? \njennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances . \nbrandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film . \nyou could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive . \nmatthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story . \nlet\'s start with settle . \nmatthew is completely fake in this film . \nyou could not believe a word coming out of his mouth . \nyou could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn\'t as good as the first one . \nhe does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn\'t clear up the scars he already left on the film . \nfreddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was . \nhe is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place . \nwe don\'t see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did . \nmekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place . \nthe plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie . \ni like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better . \nthe cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful . \nthere are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel . \nthe sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film\'s . \njennifer love hewitt\'s song , \" how do i deal \" is also played for about thirty seconds . \ni still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film . \nthe first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes . \nthe last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film . \nbefore this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares . \nthat is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes . \ni think the reason this film wasn\'t as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident . \nhe made them suffer for what they did . \nin the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like . \nhe doesn\'t stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after . \nhe had to go after karla , will , and tyrell . \nif the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense . \nthe bottom line- not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand . \n',1
'star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review \na review by jamey hughton stars ) \nstarring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g \nwith all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film . \nthe movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together . \ncan george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ? \nyes . this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity . \nbut that doesn\'t mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment . \nthe phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history . \nthe tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film . \nthe vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding . \nthe phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects . \nafter we\'re treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams\' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan\' . \nthey are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo . \noh , but enough about that . \nthe prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture . \nas you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader . \na spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter . \nthis particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you\'ll ever see . \none of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception . \ni loved sebulba , the rat-like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) . \none character who has been subject to criticism is jar-jar binks , a member of the gungan race . \njar-jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief . \nyes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics . \nthere is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses . \nthe final light-saber battle , between the jedi\'s and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold . \njabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances . \nlucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness . \none can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode\'s i and ii . \nwhen they arrive , you\'ll know where to find me . \n',1

it\'s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren\'t for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . \n \" a bug\'s life \" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it\'s g-rated and not totally over kids\' heads like \" antz \" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that\'s completely innocent even when it\'s also remaining perpetually clever . \n \" antz \" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and \" a bug\'s life \" is more for general consumption , but it\'s also more entertaining . \nit broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we\'ve never seen before , and it\'s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in \" antz . \" \nit\'s also light and clever . \nthe visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of \" antz \" at least a worthy contender . \nthe characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . \nthe lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from \" antz , \" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . \nand for the romantic lead , we don\'t get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn\'t even come around until the very final frames . \nnot that the plot\'s really any better than the one in \" antz \" - it\'s basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . \nwhen flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season\'s donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won\'t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . \nhe runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . \nthese bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . \nthe writers lightly touch on each bug\'s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . \ngrasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . \na small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . \nthe bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" \nand a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . \naround this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . \nmeanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn\'t do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug\'s life \" pulls it\'s final punch , out clever-ing \" antz \" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money\'s worth of entertainment . \nstill , it\'s no \" toy story . \" \nthat film , maybe above any animated film i\'ve ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . \nit proved that it didn\'t need to brag about it\'s cutting edge technology to really soar ( it\'s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . \nyet \" a bug\'s life , \" as well as \" antz , \" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you\'re gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they\'re not working under the same roof . \n',1
'the happy bastard\'s 30-second review \nnotting hill \na cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies . \none day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly . \nsure , there are points of turmoil , such as putting up with grant\'s slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike , anna\'s pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ) , and , on top of all that , those damn press . \nit\'s a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy , very different from , say , a stubborn father or \" not the right time \" like as seen in usual flicks . \nroberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress , and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl . \nin short , a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs , particularly provided by spike . \none tee-shirt really says it all about him . \nin an attempt to turn on a woman , he shows the front of the shirt , which says : \" you are the most beautiful woman in the world . \" \non the back ? \n \" fancy a f * * k ? \" \n',1
'an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80\'s . \nsevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte , who are on the lookout for love . \nalice is mousy , shy , intellectual , charlotte is bitchy , out-going and fun . \nwe join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures , and men , all to the background of the local disco . \nwhit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story . \nalice and charlotte are both well written characters , and the actresses who play them aren\'t bad aswell . \nsevigny delivers an honest performance , and makes the audience feel for her character . \nbeckinsale plays extreme bitch personified , yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable . \nthe huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining . \nthe dialogue is sharp and well written , with many funny set pieces . \nfor example , there\'s a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters . \nthe disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun . \nthe direction is good , bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes . \nbut their are slight flaws with the movie . \nfirstly , although it is supposedly set in the 80\'s , the characters are very , very 90\'s . \nthe way they dress and act have a very 90\'s feel to them . \nalthough the male hairstyles look slightly 80\'s , frankly the 80\'s atmosphere just wasn\'t conveyed , which is a shame . \nalso , as mentioned above , the film is too long , and some parts do lag . \nthe charm of the characters do help these moments , but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter . \nthe plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust , which seemed out of place in this movie . \nfinally , their are almost too many characters in the film , and despite the running time , the film never really spends enough time on them . \nsome of the characters are very slight , which is a shame . \nthe conclusion , while funny , is also surprisingly weak , and certainly not strong enough . \nbut despite these qualms , the last days of disco is a funny , warm movie , which is certainly worth seeing , and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80\'s . \nworth a look . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n',1
'the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \nit\'s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \nthese two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \nduke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \nhe leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \nfear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \nit doesn\'t , even in the beginning--while the pair\'s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \ndirector terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we\'re laughing , we\'re laughing at them rather than with them . \nthey spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \nthe black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it\'s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \nall this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \nthankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . \nnow it\'s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \nthe social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \nin many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam\'s most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \nyet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke\'s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \nunlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \nduring the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn\'t seem to approve , doesn\'t do anything to stop it either . \nby the time this scene takes place , they don\'t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \nduke seems to realize at some level that he\'s become something he doesn\'t like , but he\'s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \nthere\'s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \'60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren\'t usually very pleasant . \nunlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who\'s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \nin its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it\'s sad and regretful , but i think it\'s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \nindeed , duke himself admits at one point that he\'s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \ni\'m not sure if he\'s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . \n',1
'reflecting on \" bedazzled , \" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind . \nif hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way . \nwith her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . \nit\'s practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down . \nher next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please . \nto aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring \" steve the copy guy \" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills . \neugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way . \nyet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he\'s a lovable oaf . \nhe wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o\'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him . \nhowever , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball\'s chance in hell . \n \" dear god , \" he prays . \n \" i would give anything to have that girl in my life . \" \nguess who then shows up ? \nshe makes an offer that is too hard to refuse . \n \" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . \" \nthere\'s even an escape clause . \nif elliot\'s wish doesn\'t go exactly the way he likes , he need only \'beep\' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over . \nthe remainder of the film consists of elliot\'s various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison\'s love . \nbut when he makes sweeping statements such as \" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison \" , he\'ll soon learn that the devil is in the details . \nfor example , ( and we\'ve seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he\'s a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else . \napparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul . \nhis other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life . \nsoon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal . \ngiven the mischievous nature of the devil , \" bedazzled \" has many amusing moments . \na lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance . \nhe ably assumes various personas . \nhis funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world . \nallison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her . \nhurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one . \nit\'s clear that she\'s having a good time with it all . \nyet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story . \nbut that would be playing with fire . \nwhat they\'ve got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is . \n',1
'this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960\'s under the same appellation . \nmind you , most people ( including yours truly ) who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series . \nthe movie is really a stand alone in that regard . \nthe family robinson . . . lost in space . \nplot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future . \na colonization process , if you will . \nthey are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip . \neventually , their trek goes awry , and all are \" lost in space \" . \n \" how do get back to earth ? \" \nis the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic . \ncritique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5/10 ) from the summer of 1997 . \nit\'s a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance . \nadmittedly , there isn\'t an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line . \nhaving said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average . \nyou really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls . \nunfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? \nyawn ! ) . \nthe acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend\'s matt leblanc who shows us all that he\'s definitely more than just a pretty face . \non the down side , the family riff-raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time-consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for \" trying \" to develop characters in a sci-fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he\'s \" evil \" , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long . \non the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is \" paralyzed \" during the hyper-drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that \" somehow \" they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very \nodd . . . . . ) . \noverall , if you\'re a big sci-fi fan , check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative , and if you\'re not , i would still suggest seeing this movie , but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts . \nlittle known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7/10 ) out of the top spot at the box-office after 15 straight weeks at number one . \ngarry oldman is british , and was once married to uma thurman for about six months . \nmimi rogers was tom cruise\'s first wife . \n',1
'armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . \nstories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . \narmageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you\'ll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . \nbut i loved every freaking minute of it . \nbelieve me , i\'m just as shocked as you are . \nhell , i don\'t even know why i went to see it in the first place . \nthe previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . \ni\'m sorry , but \" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! \" \nisn\'t quite the tagging that\'s going to sell a movie . \nit isn\'t too wise either to market the film using the movie\'s stupidest lines ( \" beam me up scotty \" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . \ni mean , let\'s face it ; armageddon\'s previews rival the truman show\'s as being some of the worst of the year . \nneither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . \nof course , you all know the story . \nwhen the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us\'s top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . \nin the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . \nbelonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who\'s always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g\'s . \nalso , there\'s the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . \nhe kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . \nthen on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can\'t quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . \nbasically , that\'s about it . \nas i said , this is hardly a film about plot . \nit\'s another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . \ncase in point : nasa doesn\'t know that there is even an asteroid on it\'s way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? \nanother example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . \nhow pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! \nwant another one ? \nokay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing \" leaving on a jet plane \" , and soon , all the rest join in . \ndid michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? \nbut naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin\' time at the movies . \nand don\'t get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . \nso even if you don\'t win one of mcdonald\'s free tickets , it\'s still definitely worth checking out . \n',1

'linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma\'s lead is nothing short of inexplicable . \nshe\'s still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who\'s lost her faith . \none night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany\'s bedroom . \nhe is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . \ngod would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . \nbethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the \" prophets \" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith\'s films thus far . \nat some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) \" thirteenth apostle \" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . \nit\'s a wild ride . \nthey\'re in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . \nloki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . \nat one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . \nit\'s a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , \" how corrupt are you ? \" . \nwings of desire this ain\'t . \nsince debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . \n ( chris rock is this film\'s only weak link-between jokes , he\'s wooden . ) \nhis no-frills visual style hasn\'t changed much over the years , though ( dogma\'s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . \ndogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . \nas well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . \nany movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma\'s pacing goes slack . \na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we\'ve heard enough . \nbecause his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki\'s bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . \nsure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . \nlike tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . \ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! \nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan \" catholicism wow ! \" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . \ni bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . \nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . \nit\'s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . \nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ\'s , martin scorsese\'s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis\' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture\'s content but to rumours and heresy . \nthere\'s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . \n ( not one of them had watched it . ) \nevery single person refused . \nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith\'s bethany and scorsese\'s jesus are hollow shells without their faith . \nin fact , dogma\'s denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that\'s worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . \n ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don\'t belong to . \nnow that\'s powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . \nit\'s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . \nmy religion is movies . \nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they\'re attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . \ni therefore feel that , although i\'m no bible-thumper , i\'m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . \n',1
'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\'re portraying , it\'s fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \nit\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\'ve seen all year , and that\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain\'t evil . \nit\'s just sad . \" \nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\'t leave them alone . \nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\'t regret it . \nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \nit\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i\'ll bet she\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \nshe was strictly an actress . \nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \nemotion . \nsadness . \nstrength . \nwatching the strong sethe , who\'s so afraid of the past that she\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \nshe makes it real . \nthat\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \nin fact , i\'d wager to say that the fact that it\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \nwhile oprah\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \nit doesn\'t necessarily move as though they\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\'s the point . \nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \njonathan demme\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \nthere\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \nact like a baby . \nthrow things . \nstumble around . \nchew food with your mouth open . \ni do think there\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\'s loss of reality towards the end . \nit\'s not that newton isn\'t great : she\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \nit\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \n',1
'in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural \" rush hour \" - to the tune of about $250 million . \nyou don\'t mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" \nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . \nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \ni\'m never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \nsurprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \nthe makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" \nfirst and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan\'s artistry in fight choreography . \nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \nchan\'s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \nthe combo of chan\'s flying feet and fists with tucker\'s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . \nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \nlone doesn\'t chew scenery or make pronouncements to \" get lee and carter , \" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \nzhang zi-yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky\'s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn\'t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . \ndirector ratner and the original \" rush hour \" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . \ncinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives \" rh2 \" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . \nproduction design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . \nthe rest of the techs are of the same high quality . \ni\'m surprised to even say that \" rush hour 2 \" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . \nit takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . \ni give it a b . \n',1

'one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there\'s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \nthis piece of work is 100\% intensity . \nit\'s uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \nit\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\' wife ) . \nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \nit\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\'t give that away . \nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \nif they didn\'t , it would be one short movie ! \nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \nwe see a lot of blood , but it\'s not especially violent . \nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in \" pulp fiction \" . \n \" se7en \" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don\'t eat food during this film . \nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he\'s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \nspacey doesn\'t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn\'t receive billing in the opening credits . \nhowever , it\'s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \nthis character is so well written that it\'s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \n \" se7en \" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it\'s often a little too depressing . \nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \nfortunately , we don\'t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \nit\'s better to imagine what paths they will follow . \nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \nit\'s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren\'t going to cure themselves . \n \" se7en \" raises some tough questions and it\'s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\'s \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) . \n',1

'airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making . \nafter all , it\'s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . \neven if most people don\'t recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . \nbut although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! \nremains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . \nin the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . \nfilms like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . \nthere was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . \nand so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . \nthis time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . \n . \n . \nit had to do with bad fish . \nairplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . \nunable to stop living in the past , ted\'s world fell apart . \nhe spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . \nin a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . \nunfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity . \nin the midst of it all , something happens . \nsomeone gets sick . \nthen another . \nthen another . \nsoon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people . \n . \n . \nand when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? \n ( gee , i wonder ) \nof course the main draw here is the non-stop \" whiz-bang \" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . \nalthough i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . \nthe most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . \nhe\'s a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . \nin a film like this , you\'re not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can\'t complain about the amateurish quality . \nwhat you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . \nthis character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . \ni don\'t know why he was put in there , and i don\'t think anybody will find a good excuse . \nand when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . \nyou gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . \naside from that , airplane ! \nis really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . \nit would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven\'t seen it . \nand if they ask what the plot is , just tell \'em \" it\'s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that\'s not important right now . \" \nif you\'ve seen the film , you\'ll understand ; - ) \n',1
'i didn\'t realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what\'s g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself . \n \" the celluloid closet \" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades . \nit\'s brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant . \nit tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen . \nregardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they\'re not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be . \nthe movie itself is rated r - and for good reason . \nit contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex . \nas with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all . \nbut , that\'s the movie . \nnow back to the preview . \nprior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times . \nthere was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone \" boning \" someone , but the last i knew that wasn\'t one of the seven words you can\'t say on tv ) . \nexcept for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing . \nhmmmmm . \nwhen i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from \" the handbook \" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain \" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone . \" \nhello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day . \nbravely , i pursued . \n \" i\'ve seen that trailer , oh . . . \nprobably half a dozen times , \" i gulped . . . \n \" and i don\'t remember that scene . \" \n \" well , \" she chirped . \n \" it\'s there . \nour little eyes are trained to see that . \" \nno really . \nin the words of dave barry , \" i am not making this up . \" \nthey are \" trained \" to \" see that ? \" \nwhen someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ? \ngosh , i certainly don\'t mean to question the mpaa , or \" the handbook \" . \ni would , however , like to suggest that it\'s they who are in the closet on this one . \nand the light ain\'t good in there . \nbut , having seen \" the celluloid closet , \" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i\'ll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise . \nthe point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society . \na point well made in this candid and honest film . \nnow , i could go off on the mpaa\'s ruling that a trailer must contain \" no homosexuality or lesbianism \" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i\'ve watched straight people do in trailers . \ni just don\'t feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious . \ni\'ll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria . \nlet the ratings reflect not subject content , like \" sex \" and \" violence \" . \nlet them reflect attitude content . \nin the future , i\'d be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped . \nthen i\'d truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time . \n',1

'almost a full decade before steven spielberg\'s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both \" anti war \" and \" pro-soldier \" , john irvin\'s hamburger hill proved it could . \nlost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone\'s platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as \" too militaristic \" . \nit\'s hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons \" chose to show up \" for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what \" the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn \" became to wwii movies . \nhamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch . \nthere is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears . \nand the climactic final assault on the \" hill \" in question is visually confusing . \ngristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered . \nand in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and \" newbie \" , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat . \nthe acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as \" seaman jones \" in mctiernan\'s red october . \nif you\'ve seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg\'s vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach . \n',1
'as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? \nalso demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don\'t often find in american films . \nthis japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school . \nintrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei . \nmeanwhile , sugiyama\'s wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband\'s trail . \nin a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings . \nin shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls . \nneither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival . \nsuo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them . \nan opening prologue in shall we dance ? \ngoes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety . \nit\'s a forced message in a story which doesn\'t need such a culture-specific angle . \nthe dance school in shall we dance ? \nplays the role of a singles\' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities . \nmost amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama\'s co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba . \nsugiyama\'s awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps . \nit\'s a delicate performance with a huge heart . \nshall we dance ? \nis a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit . \nsuo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution . \nit is here that shall we dance ? \nfeels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis . \nsuo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together . \nthat\'s the real joy of dance shall we dance ? \nconveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt . \n',1
'based on the boris karloff\'s classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . \nrecap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . \nproblem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . \nwalking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . \nthe visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . \nthey pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . \nthe computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . \nunfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . \non one hand , it is a fast paced action film . \non the other , it\'s a frightening horror film . \nand on the side , it\'s a hilarious comedy . \nideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . \nthe problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . \nif they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep\'s entombment , that would be impossible . \nand then there\'s the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . \nwhile really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . \nreplace the sword with a chainsaw and you\'d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . \nwhile entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . \nbut at least it\'s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . \non the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . \nbut i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn \nthe sound down ! \nwhile a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you\'re not careful ) . \nwhen they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , \" end of days \" , it was so loud i couldn\'t make anything out . \n',1
'for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and \" high art , \" the son\'s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . \nwritten by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . \nslow is the best description for the film at first . \nit takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . \nfather and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . \nthey laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . \nyou get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . \nbut suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . \nthe family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . \nthough the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . \nthough nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn\'t come across as a vanity piece . \none might wish he hadn\'t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character\'s reactions so predictable . \nwhat saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . \nthe potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . \nyou start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . \nyou remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . \neven better are the role reversals that take place within the household . \nwhile giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . \nnot only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she\'ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . \nthese scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . \nrespectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . \nself-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . \nthough giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . \nmost films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . \nin contrast , the son\'s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . \nit\'s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . \n',1
'no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . \nevent horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i\'m sure many who have watched this will agree with me . \nit is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . \nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . \nthe story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . \nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man\'s lifetime . \nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . \na search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . \nthe designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . \nevent horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . \nwhile in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . \nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! \ni can\'t stand this anymore ! \' . \nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere\' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror\' . \nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience\' of event horizon . \ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \n',1
'insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute\' indians that doesn\'t seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \nthe aforementioned `ute\' indian tribe that packer\'s group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \nstone\'s humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt\' or revealing what\'s underneath his muff cap . \njason mchugh\'s character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \nas i mentioned before , parker\'s songs are very catchy . \nyou\'ll be hard pressed to get `it\'s a shpadoinkle day\' out of your head once you\'ve heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \nother songs you\'ll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you\' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper\'s song\' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard\' ( the rousing finale ) . \nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut\'s songs are . \nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \nas for the dvd . . . \nwell , that\'s a different story . \nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \nthe musical ! \nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \nspecific extras . \nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i\'ve ever seen on any disc . \nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven\'t scratched the surface of the extras . \nthere\'s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \nit\'s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . \nkudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time . \n',1
'i\'m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . \nwhen tim burton\'s twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it\'s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . \nand when it doesn\'t work , it\'s just dull . \ni\'m not even sure it works more often than it doesn\'t , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! \nis brilliant . \nmars attacks ! \nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer\'s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman\'s thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \nit\'s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \nit\'s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton\'s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove\'s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house\'s \" kennedy room , \" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it\'s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \" they blew up congress ! \" \nand plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . \njim brown and tom jones are the film\'s vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . \nalso on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen\'s everyone says i love you ) . \nthe real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they\'re fantastic . \nwith bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante\'s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton\'s little monsters are more inventive . \nthe film\'s raison d\'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . \nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . \nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it\'s earned . \nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! \nwas in production long before that film\'s release . \ncinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas\'s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! \nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . \ncronenberg\'s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won\'t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! \nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare . \nthis is not a nice movie . \n ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) \nby setting the film\'s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton\'s invasion epic suggests that the world we\'ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . \nthe victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie\'s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . \nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . \nultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year\'s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . \n',1
'every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody\'s surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \nmtv films\' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \nthe plot is deceptively simple . \ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \nmr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \nand paul\'s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \nyou can\'t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \nthe similarities are staggering : \ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe even gets a bee sting . \nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe gets several bee stings . \nand so on . \nwhat happened ? \nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn\'t been fully formed yet ? \neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul\'s anti-social sister , tammy . \nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he\'s had since then . \nwitherspoon is a revelation . \nit\'s early in the year , it\'s a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \nand once campbell\'s character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you\'re won over . \none thing that\'s been bothering me since i\'ve seen it . \nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn\'t like tracy\'s determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \neven so , there\'s no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \nthere\'s a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \n',1
'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning . \nfrom my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet\'s script was actually a masterpiece . \nthe spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer\'s complete attention . \nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative \" process \" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his \" process . \" \nthrough his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross\' boss mr . klein . \nplayed by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . \nthe most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott\'s joe ross . \nthe character\'s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . \ndavid mamet\'s script is so interesting because we know people don\'t actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . \nhis beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . \nthis is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . \n',1
'_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction . \nif you haven\'t heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven\'t seen it -- well , i suspect you\'re in a small minority ! \nfirst thing\'s first ? is it all it\'s hyped up to be ? \nwell , yes ? and no . \nit\'s a good film , and there\'s a lot to like about it , but it\'s not without its problems . \nwhen i saw the first trailer for \" titanic \" , it was when i went to see \" bean \" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain\'t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! \ni mean , what\'s happened to hollywood\'s script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? \ngads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? \ni was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn\'t alone in that respect . \nit\'s when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who\'d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! \ni didn\'t see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , \nso i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn\'t think i\'d enjoy it much . \ndid i ? yes and no . \nmainly yes , i\'m happy to say . \nthe first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i\'ll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron\'s directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the \" human \" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . \nthe film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a\' course ! \n : - ) ) . \nwell , it\'s an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . \ndoes it work here ? \nin script form it doesn\'t add all that much to the story . \nwhat does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . \nher presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . \nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . \nit\'s an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack\'s \" rescuing \" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . \nin fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . \nit\'s engaging , touching and very enjoyable . \nthere\'s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it\'s not going to be a happy ending . \nwhich leads us to the second half of the film . \nwe all knew it was coming . \ni\'m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he\'s stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . \ni think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . \nthe iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . \nand it is an hour . \nmy goodness , we don\'t miss a second of that hour ? \ngratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today\'s standards , i\'m sure there\'s been far worse produced under the banner of \" entertainment \" in other films . \nbut i certainly wasn\'t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . \nnot that i\'d expect the word \" understatement \" to be part of cameron\'s vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as \" terminator 2 \" and \" aliens \" ) . \nis it overdone ? \ni thought so . \nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . \nno , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn\'t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film\'s second half . \nstill , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! \nyou really couldn\'t help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose\'s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . \nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . \nthe bit where rose lets go of jack\'s hand , while promising she\'ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . \ni loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . \nso , we\'ve established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . \nhaven\'t mentioned the script . \nplot-wise it\'s ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i\'ve a feeling that\'s to the actors credit if anything . \nas for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . \nit\'s a period drama . \nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . \ndid they really use phrases like \" goddamn it ! \" \nback in the turn of the century ? \ni doubt it . \nwould someone talk like this : \" do ya love the guy or what ? \" . \ni doubt it . \nis such dialogue as \" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now \" not just a bit ? clumsy ? \nyes it is . \na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . \nstick with directing , dude . \nbut its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . \nstar of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn\'t she win that oscar ? ! \nafter all , they were throwing oscars at \" titanic \" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . \ndirecting-wise cameron does a spectacular job . \nlike i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . \ni haven\'t even mentioned james horner\'s beautiful score . \nutterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! \n ; - ) \ni\'ve finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! \njust leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? \nhell , don\'t talk to me about oscars . \nbloomin\' farce . \nit was deserving in a number of departments , though . \nlast question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? \nnope , i don\'t think so . \nit\'s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i\'ve ever seen , but i don\'t think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . \nand as for the fact they\'re reportedly making a \" titanic 2 \" ? well i guess that\'s typical hollywood for you ! \n',1
'fritz lang\'s first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . \njoe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . \nhe is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can\'t save up enough money to marry her . \nshe takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . \nbefore she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . \na year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . \ndriving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . \nbut the deputy sheriff \" buggs \" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . \nhe accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . \nthe sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . \nlocked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . \nin the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . \nfueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can\'t get through to the prisoner\'s jail cell . \nthe sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn\'t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . \nsomehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . \nkatherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . \nthe next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . \njoe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . \nhe thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . \nan ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . \nkatherine , not knowing he\'s alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . \nthe defense claims that it can\'t be a charge of murder without a corpse . \nthe trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn\'t have been at the jail . \nthe sheriff also lies , saying he can\'t identify anyone in the mob . \nbut proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . \nas for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . \nin the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . \nwhen the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . \nkatherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . \nbut don\'t blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . \nmgm couldn\'t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . \ninstead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . \nto lang\'s credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . \nhis portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . \nyou couldn\'t help get the feeling that the citizens didn\'t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . \ntheir reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren\'t going to be convicted . \nlang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . \nhe does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . \n',1
'the ring is probably one of the creepiest movies i\'ve seen in years . \nbut then again , i\'ve always had this phobia of asian born horror films . \ni remember when i was a kid i was scared as hell with those green faced , long-haired floating ghosts donning their white gownseuuugh . \nthe ring really brings back those memories and its grips me long after the movie has ended . \nunlike the horror films coming from the west , i\'m pretty much used to the gore and visual effects , so much so , they become rather bland nowadays . \nthere\'s really no scary movie from the west for a long time . \nif you have something in mind , please tell me . \nthis japanese flick is supposed to be based upon stories written by `the stephen king of japan\' , which is also ( i heard ) televised over the air in japan . \nthe film revolves around a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to the person who watches it , one week prior to viewing . \na journalist and her husband , stupid enough , tests the so call `urban legend\' and ends up having a week before she meets her doom . \nshe and her husband then goes on a search for the origin of the videocassette , to get to the root of the whole curse with the hopes of freeing themselves . \nthe ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today . \nvisual subtlety , minimal music and an intriguing plot puts the audience within an aura of suspense throughout the entire film . \nvery well done indeed , especially for a film that does not have a single trace of violence and gore . \nnow , thats something budding horror film-maker wannabes should consider looking into . \njust an idea of how visually powerful the film is , it is in japanese and subtitled in chinese ; both of which , i can\'t understand at all ( ok , i had a friend who gave me a gist prior to watching , but he revealed very little ! ) . \nthe twists in the plot , leading to an unforgettable climax ( will definitely leave an impression on the audience ) will have you at the edge of your seat . \n',1
' \" you leave little notes on my pillow . \ni told you a million times i can\'t stand little notes on my pillow . \n\'we are all out of corn flakes - f . u . \' \nit took me three hours to figure out that \'f . u . \' was felix unger . \" \n--- a frustrated oscar madison ( walter matthau ) running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger ( jack lemmon ) , in the odd couple . \nthe classic neil simon comedy ( based on his own stage play ) about suicidal felix ( lemmon ) , who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar ( matthau ) to stay with him in his apartment after felix\'s wife throws him out and files for divorce . \nthe hook : oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way , while felix is an obsessive/compulsive neat freak . \nthe two men , despite their friendship , instantly clash . \nmovies just aren\'t as delightfully funny as this one is . \nevery line of neil simon\'s dialogue flows like comedic poetry , and all the actors are just perfect in their performances . \nlemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix , but it\'s matthau who shines brightest as oscar , whose world is being invaded and rearranged , mostly against his wishes ( the type of character i always enjoy identifying with ) . \nand who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti ? \nthe best thing about the film ( and this is a testament to the quality of the writing ) is that it\'s a comedy with substance . \nthese two men , even while at each other\'s throats , genuinely care for one another as friends . \nwhen they clash , it isn\'t cartoonish hatred being displayed , but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co-exist . \nmovies nowadays , take grumpy old men for example , just don\'t have that extra spark there . \nthese days it\'s just animosity for the sake of comedy . \na television series followed ( starring jack klugman and tony randall ) , which i\'ll admit i\'ve never seen an episode of in its entirety , and neil simon even scripted the sequel , the odd couple ii , which was released in 1998 . \nneither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though . \nit\'s one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films . \n',1
'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \nthe film is based upon the comic book series \" the flaming carrot \" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \n \" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \nthat is until they aquire \" invisible boy \" ( kel mitchell ) , and \" the bowler \" ( janeane garafalo ) and \" mr . splein \" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \none was paul reuben . \nno matter how disgusting or revolting \" mr . splein \" may be , you still can\'t help but laugh . \nit\' so incredibly moronic , it\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \ntheir parts were so limited , they\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \nit forgets about money making , because it\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\'s proceeders , and that\'s what works . \nstupid ? \nmaybe , but for once i\'m not disappointed . \nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \n',1
'the question isn\'t why has grease been reissued . \nthe answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie\'s 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount\'s coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity . \nno , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? \nthe answer is not an easy one . \ngrease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the \'50s , embodying all the cliches of that era . \nthe music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited . \ntravolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening . \nbut grease didn\'t break any new cinematic ground . \nit was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider . \nwhat grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history . \nok , let\'s not be a spoilsport . \ngrease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi\'s jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers . \nit\'s nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it\'s sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career . \nhe could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly . \ncinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur . \nbetween grease and 1996\'s evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand . \ntwo reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded . \ntoday , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen . \ntoday\'s audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed . \nsecondly , a lack of talent . \nperformers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone . \nmost singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts . \na good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world . \nhe danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles . \nso , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose . \nif audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals . \nperhaps not original musicals such as singin\' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years . \nat one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber\'s cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna . \nso , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals . \nlet grease be the word that sparks this revival . \n',1
' \" the fugitive \" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . \nit takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that\'s totally believable throughout . \nthis isn\'t an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . \nharrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . \nthe entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . \nwe constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble\'s perspective . \nhints are dropped from various times of the night kimble\'s wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . \nwe don\'t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . \nin fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble\'s innocence ourselves . \nthe film doesn\'t spend much time on the details of kimble\'s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . \none of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . \nbut it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . \nthis movie is so incredible because it\'s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . \ntommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . \nfrom the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . \nkimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . \nmost of the film deals with richard\'s complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . \nford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy\'s script and davis\'s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . \njust watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . \nwe know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . \nmeanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . \nat one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . \nhe leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . \none of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . \nthere is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . \nthey are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . \nthe final act concludes with another terrific chase . \nrichard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . \nthe man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don\'t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . \nmaybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . \nwe\'re so relieved when justice is served . \nit\'s not the plot is that makes \" the fugitive \" great , it\'s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . \nwatching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . \nif only hollywood could produce more movies like this . \n ( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : \" nick of time \" ] \n',1
'you know you\'re in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question\'s most normal character . \nsuch is the case with \" the big lebowski , \" joel and ethan coen\'s first venture since their \" fargo \" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods . \nthere\'s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because \" lebowski \" is an effort that makes words like \" strange \" and \" unusual \" seem like an understatement . \nthanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success . \nthe central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) . \none night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that\'s supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude . \nonce the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long . \nsoon , though , lebowski\'s trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help . \nit seems bunny\'s troubles are related to a line of work she\'s kept secret from her husband -- she\'s actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn . \nthe dude , now on lebowski\'s payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself . \nchaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski\'s ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) . \n \" the big lebowski \" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that \" fargo \" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , \" lebowski \" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . \nthe movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does . \nthe coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . \nwhether we\'re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , \" the big lebowski \" is immensely lively . \nthere are those who will dislike this film , but not because it\'s boring . \nthe cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they\'re given . \nbridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn\'t the cleanest guy around , but you\'d still follow him to another movie . \ngoodman merits 1998\'s first oscar consideration , as walter\'s manic temper is one of \" the big lebowski \" \'s many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . \njohn turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . \nsam elliott\'s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . \nand some will recognize peter stormare -- \" fargo \" \'s silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who\'s really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star . \nonly in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . \nthese flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it\'s hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . \nwithout a doubt , \" the big lebowski \" is the best film so far this year . \nsure , we\'re only three months in and the competition ( \" deep rising , \" \" desperate measures , \" \" the wedding singer , \" etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it\'s still the gospel truth . \nmaybe during next awards season , \" lebowski \" won\'t be a far cry from \" fargo . \" \n',1

'originally titled \'don\'t lose your head\' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . \ntwo english fops , the \'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned\' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . \ndue to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . \nffing becomes known as \'the black fingernail\' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . \nafter the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen \'the big cheese\' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . \n ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) \nonce at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . \nhe tells her his identity and gives her his locket . \nwhen camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! \njacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . \nthey pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . \ndesiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . \nffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the \'chateau neuve\' , and a climactic sword-fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! \na more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on-form cast . \nsid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert\'s thick-witted crony . \nother acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . \nalthough it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better-than-usual script . \ndefinitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch . \n',1
'garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men , who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there . \nshandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle . \nafter a few disastrous \" mating \" attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won\'t have sex again until she gets married . \nthe leader of harold\'s planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the \" joys \" of married life . \ndespite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? \nis a very funny movie . \nthe plot ( which the film wisely doesn\'t linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well . \nthe material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead . \nbut he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it\'s his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive . \nplus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? \ncould have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling\'s character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) . \nwe never see anything though , it\'s all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness . \ni\'m glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of \" less is more \" . \nthe talented supporting cast certainly adds to one\'s enjoyment of this film . \nannette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) \ndoes a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor . \nshe even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of \" high hopes \" for a lengthy period of time . \nben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino . . . \ngood lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy . \neverything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality . \nwhat planet are you from ? \nis available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . \nthe disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions . \nalso included on the disc as extras : a decent making-of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film\'s original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) . \nwhen i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . \nhow great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it\'s own isolated track ? \nwell as it turns out , it\'s a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review . \nkudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc . \nwhat planet are your from ? \nwas unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video . \nthis fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it . \n[r] \n',1
'let\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\'s worth . \nwouldn\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \" investments \" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n',1
'the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid\'s point of view is , in a word , \" dark \" . \nyou wouldn\'t expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson\'s novel , but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal . \njekyll/hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate . \nmary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman sentiment of the times . \ndirector stephen fears\' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them . \nthe lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie : it almost appears to be filmed in black and white . \nthe direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid . \nscenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry . \n ( except there\'s no red , of course . ) \nthe look is so moody and melodramatic that you\'ll be shocked when you leave the theater . \ni saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward . \noften the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts . \nhere the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless . \nhis alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience . \ntwo parts that make up a whole . \nneither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable . \nthe differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude . \nwhen we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands . \nroberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles . \nboth are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film . \nthe only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents . \nlife and color maybe , but this is not close\'s best role . \nshe seems little more than a cardboard cutout character . \na beautiful film in its own dreary way . \nyou\'ll appreciate the filmmaking craft , but don\'t expect to leave in an upbeat mood . \n',1

'it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . \nno major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . \nthe americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . \nsmall wonder that hollywood\'s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on . \nthere\'s little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government\'s been long worried about the younger people getting \" americanised \" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . \nthe people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex . \ndoes pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? \nlarry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net . \nbut even with such actions , americans remain undecided . \nthe oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . \nwhat they have ignored is actually a great picture . \nwoody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . \nand he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . \nthe latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . \nedward norton plays their jerky lawyer . \nthe relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who\'ve had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . \ngod\'s damnation . \nbut in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . \nfriedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . \nto go beyond good and evil . \nthis is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . \nbecause it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . \nbut i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . \nthere are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . \nthis movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . \n',1
'\'pleasantville\' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood\'s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed \n ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) \ncast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t . \nwalsh , jeff daniels \nmpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements \ngenre : drama \nin my opinion : \nin short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . \nreview : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . \nthe town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . \nthere is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . \nput simply , it\'s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . \nj one big note however is that it is only a 50\'s sitcom that airs in reruns on an \" oldies \" tv station ? or is it ? \ni had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . \ni found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . \nbut it wasn\'t until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy \" dollar theaters \" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . \nit is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some \" healthy \" immorality is not a world at all . \ninstead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn\'t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . \nthere is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . \nnow i\'m not saying that\'s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . \nbesides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . \nthe visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . \nafter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it\'s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . \na truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . \nthat said , the plot goes as such . \ndavid and jennifer are two very 90\'s high school twins with the typical \" relationship \" outline of don\'t-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won\'t-mess-with-yours . \nthey demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . \ndavid is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . \nbut when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . \nnevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . \nand , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . \nnot only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . \npeople got hurt . \nthey cried . \nthey became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that\'s when their physical world turned colors as well . \nthis can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . \ni hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we\'ll never know what we could have done better . \nuntil the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr \n',1
'i don\'t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it\'s something i used to wonder about when i was younger . \ni can\'t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i\'m pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . \nthe truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . \nsince birth , he\'s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . \nall the people in truman burbank\'s life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . \npeople watch truman\'s life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . \nrevenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman\'s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . \nthe sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . \neven if you haven\'t seen the truman show , you\'ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . \nif anything i\'ve written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . \neither way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you\'ll probably think it sucks . \nit begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial \" eat me \" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . \nbut weird things start happening . \na stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . \nwe learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . \nthe death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . \nsimilar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman\'s best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he\'s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he\'d ever do is hurt him . \nas truman\'s trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . \nthere\'s even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman\'s existence . \nthe key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . \nand it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . \nhe\'s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . \nmost fundamentally , it\'s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person\'s life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . \nthe most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . \nsure , the most interesting tv genre of the \'90s has been reality programming and jerry springer\'s popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . \nand when news shows use hidden cameras , it\'s done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . \nbut merge the two and you\'ve got the truman show . \nright now , it\'s implausible -- i mean , the fcc won\'t let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they\'d let you broadcast every detail of a man\'s life to the entire world without his consent ? \none day , though , it could happen . \nand , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . \nyou know they would . \n',1
'the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane . \nbilly , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble . \nchristopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books . \nhe thinks he\'s a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports . \njack , played by peter boyle , thinks he\'s jesus . \nand finally , there\'s stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases . \nthe dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium . \nduring a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan . \nthe movie\'s charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast . \nthe four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another . \nhenry and jack , for example , fight over who\'s going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game . \nthe actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other . \nmichael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity . \nas the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh . \nalthough stephen furst\'s catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing . \nwhile keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it\'s christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special . \nlloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance . \nhis body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character . \nlloyd\'s brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character . \nthe dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise . \nthe characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot . \n',1
'when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? \nthere have been several recent political films that didn\'t do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? \nbulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ? \nit\'s a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story . \n ? \nbeatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ? \nhe hasn\'t slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . \n ? he\'s not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he\'s definitely bonkers . \n ? it\'s the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . \n ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ? \n \" you mean , \" one lady asks , \" the democratic party doesn\'t care about the african american community ? \" ? \n \" well , \" he shouts , laughing , \" isn\'t that obvious ? \" \nthe story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it\'s a bad thing to make decisions when you\'re suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . \n ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . \n ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth\'s no-nonsense \" truth in politics \" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he\'s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . \nbeatty\'s work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? \nhis script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? \nhere is a man who\'s reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? \ni like that the film doesn\'t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? \nsome of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? \nmuch of the film is completely absurd , but that\'s the fun part about it . ? \nit\'s an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? \nwhat adds to this feeling is beatty\'s portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . \n ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he\'s always funny , but he\'s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . \n ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . \nthe supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? \nberry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? \ndon cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? \noliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he\'s very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . \nis bulworth offensive ? ? \ni suppose some may see it that way . ? \ni wasn\'t offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? \ni think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? \nthe film isn\'t perfect , of course -- the ending didn\'t quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? \nbut these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? \nbulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ? \n',1
'there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . \nin the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year\'s stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . \nat least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . \nshe has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn\'t seem like it\'s much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . \ndrugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the \'good life\' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . \nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . \nin this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . \neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . \nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud\'s grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . \nit is written by the director\'s brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . \nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . \nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don\'t know what to make of the relationship . \nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother\'s loose attitude and wants to go home . \nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \nit seems only that bilal\'s charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \nthis scene didn\'t make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \nbut i doubt that . \nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a \'normal\' girl . \nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \nthe family\'s travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn\'t comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \nthe film\'s weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn\'t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \nthe film\'s strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn\'t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she\'s at . \nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \nand , after all is said and done , who\'s to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \n',1
'it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . \nafter having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . \none gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . \nthere is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people\' . \nin fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) . \nso what are the lessons learnt : 1 . \ndon\'t take your children to class reunions . \n2 . don\'t leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second . \nmichelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres\' and ? one fine day\' . \nmy comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively . \nwhoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop . \nlastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind . \n',1
'when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . \nfrom the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they\'re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don\'t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say \" i\'ll be right back , \" etc . ) . \nwhen i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . \nhow hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . \nwas this wes craven\'s remedy from making \" real \" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? \nit just seemed cheap to me . \nthen i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude . \nscream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it\'s also a pretty scary movie . \nif you\'ve seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen . \nthis is part of the fun of watching scream . \nthe movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers . \nto those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film . \nthere\'s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though . \ni have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics . \ntheir opinions on the film were so different but both very positive . \nfrom these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . \nfilms that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream . \nthe low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990\'s . \nthis influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson\'s creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors . \nscream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson . \nwithin the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie . \nmainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you\'re dead meat ) . \nnot only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . \nthe script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction . \nin this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience\'s satisfaction and amusement . \ni hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies . \ni will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream\'s perfect subtlety . \nhowever my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . . \nso who knows . \n',1
'not since oliver stone\'s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \nwhile fincher\'s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997\'s the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob\'s breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy \" tourist \" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don\'t ask-- you\'ll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn\'t feel good . \nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \nhe moves into tyler\'s squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are \" don\'t talk about fight club . \" \narmed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . \nresentment creeps into jack\'s heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . \nfunded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . \ntheir initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . \nit is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . \nit is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . \nit\'s a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . \nfight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . \nin the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . \ni\'ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don\'t spring up here and there , and i\'ll be even more amazed if fincher isn\'t vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . \nthey needn\'t bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher\'s elaborate attempt at a joke . \ntyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . \nin this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won\'t . \nhopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won\'t spoil the joke for the rest of us . \n',1
'even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection . \nthe similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . \nit would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . \nanother more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . \nthis is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . \nwhat helps final destination is its unique premise . \nunlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it\'s the grim reaper . \nthis being already has predestined when and how you will die . \naccording to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . \nwhat is unique about death is that it\'s already dead , so you can\'t really kill it . \nthe only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? \nthis dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . \nalex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . \nalex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . \nshortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . \nhowever , death isn\'t through with them yet . \nit gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . \nthe plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . \nsome scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . \ncreativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . \nsure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter\'s character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . \nalso director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . \nhe knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won\'t win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . \nthe myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . \nand from this , i had a great time watching the movie . \n',1
'to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . \nthe mouse factory\'s latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . \nmulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn\'t seeking her prince charming , \nmulan\'s motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . \nthe story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . \nthe emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . \nmulan\'s crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . \nmulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . \nyet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . \nthe movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . \nwong as shang , mulan\'s commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan\'s proud , but loving father . \nalso adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan\'s ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . \nhis fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it\'s a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . \nthe movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan\'s are winners . \nthe music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . \nthe overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . \nmulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . \nat about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . \nmulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . \nalso , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . \nit would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n',1
'the word \'rest\' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all . \nwhat does takes place is more based on character development . \nthe film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid . \nwhat they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at . \nnick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana . \n ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . ) \ncarol is nick\'s ex-girlfriend and beth\'s best friend , sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in . \nobviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there\'s a lot of things left out . \nit\'s not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn\'t mentioned . \nand why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn\'t seen them for many years . \nset in a small ( fictional ? ) \ntown in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings . \nthe name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future . \nparticularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . \nnot an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i\'ll keep an eye on her in the future . \ninteresting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated \'barntill ? ten\' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it . \n',1
'anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . \nit\'s true beauty comes from it\'s subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it\'s between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . \nanna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . \nwith son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . \nmongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country\'s future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . \nanna function is to help provide that link . \nthe core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . \nfoster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . \nshe is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . \nit is one of foster\'s strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . \nshe brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . \nit\'s a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut\'s monarchy . \nwhen she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . \nchow-yun fat\'s king mongkut is every measure of foster\'s anna , perhaps even more so . \nthis is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . \nhe is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . \nit is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . \nprecious time is stolen from the movie\'s 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king\'s concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . \nit strikes with the subtlety of siam\'s fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . \nsome may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . \nalthough a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . \nanna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . \nit shows a seduction of intelligence . \never mindful of each other\'s positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . \n',1
'i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video . \nit really scared me , and i didn\'t want to go see it . \nhowever , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . \ni didn\'t get a chance to do so , until now . \nthe film , disney\'s 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . \nit has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . \nthen , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . \ntaran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper\' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . \none day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen\'s thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . \nan evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . \ntaran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . \nalong the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings\' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . \nwhen he hears hen wen\'s squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king\'s castle from far away . \ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \nthe three manage to escape the horned king\'s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen\'s trail . \nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks\' , to a whirlpool . \nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . \ntaran agrees , much to eilonwy\'s horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . \nbut ? the cauldron can\'t be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . \nthe only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . \nthings take a turn for the worse when the horned king\'s henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . \njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king\'s castle just as it self-destructs . \nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain\' . \nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \nthe trade is made ; gurgi\'s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \nbringing this book to the screen was the studio\'s fondest dream . \nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \nmany of the studio\'s old men had retired or died . \ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied\' from lloyd alexander\'s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney\'s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart\' and `unmemorable\' , compared to other disney animated features . \nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \nthe failure of the film grounded the studio\'s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio\'s reputation . \nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn\'t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \nthe people who had seen the film didn\'t think so . \nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn\'t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! \' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn\'t . \nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn\'t expect much at all . \nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn\'t think the film would ever be such a good film . \nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? \nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? \nthis doesn\'t seem like all of the above . \ninstead , it\'s a classic in its own right . \nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \nthere\'s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story\'s hero . \nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \nthere\'s a likeable character here ! \nnot that he\'s the only likeable character in the film . \nthere\'s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don\'t quite hit it off at first . \nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film\'s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren\'t quite as well rounded as they should be . \nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \nelmer bernstein\'s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \noverall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . \nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . \nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney\'s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . \nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \neven though it doesn\'t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . \nthat better chance has finally come . \nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney\'s most proudest achievements . \ni can\'t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?

'natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree . \nboth films glamorize \" outlaws , \" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers . \nboth relate the story of a couple liberated by love . \nbut where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant . \nwhere bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological . \nwhat bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores . \nwhat bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill . \nto examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields . \nfor the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed . \nthis mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity . \nbrahma created . \nvishnu preserved . \nand siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma . \nthe following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i\'m forced to say it for clarity\'s sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics . \nyour plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers . \ni think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena . \nmuslims kill christians . \nhindus kill muslims . \nchristians kill pagans . \njews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged . \nreligion is an orgy of killing . \nthe institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn\'t been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable . \n \" the state is the divine idea upon earth , \" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc . \nwell , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ? \nlet me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . \nconsider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . \ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . \nduring the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . \n ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . \nin the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . \nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) \ncatholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . \nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . \nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . \nthis is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . \nas further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . \nour culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . \nwe can\'t help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . \nmickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . \nit is a straightforward liberation through sex . \nas some good patriarch once observed , \" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . \" \nm&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . \nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \n \" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , \" as mickey says . \nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . \nwe are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . \n \" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans \" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . \nbeyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . \nwe have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . \nwho else has found it ? --the \nman of today ? -- \" i \ndon\'t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn\'t know either the way out or the way in \" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . \nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \nfor example wayne gayle\'s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i\'d be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he\'d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \nlet me exemplify what i\'ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin\' head i\'ve ever had in my life ! ! ! \" \nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn\'t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \nit\'s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \nas the attendant approached he took on mickey\'s character in the eyes of mallory . \nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \nthe style of the movie is a whole \'nother matter that i won\'t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \nthese can\'t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : \nmickey to mallory : \" one of these days i\'m gonna be cummin\' for you , \" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . \nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . \nat the time they haven\'t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . \nthe two of course go hand in hand . \nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . \nmickey during his marriage to mallory : \" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . \" \nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . \nit reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . \nthis is what mickey means by \" creator of my universe , \" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . \nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . \nscagnetti\'s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant\'s mouth . \nthe indian sage releasing mallory\'s father , who was reincarnated as a snake : \" old man , go be a snake , \" after telling his \" snake story \" that ends with \" bitch , you knew i was a snake . \" \nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , \" you killed life ! ! ! \" \nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didn\'t see themselves as killers of life . \nthen what were they killing up to that time ? \nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . \nin other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . \nthe butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . \nit of course symbolizes rebirth . \ndr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : \" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don\'t give a damn . \" \nthis is reminiscent of nietzsche\'s whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . \nmickey : \" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . \" \nmickey ( again in his interview ) : \" me and you , we are not the same species . \" \nnotice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . \nmickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . \nthe wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . \nmickey : how ya feelin\' ? \nwayne : fucking great ! \nmickey : you got the feelin\' ? \nwayne : i\'m alive . \ni\'m alive for the first fuckin\' time ! \nwhat an incredible transformation this is . \nhe got the feeling and he couldn\'t contain himself . \nwhat a feeling . \nthat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . \nmickey when almost caught in a dead end , \" think , think , think , think . \" \ngo figure it out . \ndwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . \nhis whole attitude can be summed up with , \" destroy them ! ! ! \" \n',1

'saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . \nstarring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the \'greatest war movie ever made , \' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . \nit may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it\'s certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . \ntom hanks stars as a captain who\'s troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . \naction , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . \nafter the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . \ni\'m not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . \ntom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . \nthis time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . \noccasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . \nedward burns , looking a lot like armageddon\'s ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she\'s the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . \nspielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . \nand what battle scenes they are ! \nthey\'re truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . \nthe battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . \nthe gore and violence isn\'t spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . \nthis film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . \nother factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90\'s film making . \nthe cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william\'s is also superb . \nit is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . \nbut while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there\'s one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . \nit is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . \nthe film never really makes any profound statements . \nthis is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . \nstill , the script could of been a lot better . \nthankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . \nsaving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the \'greatest war movie\' due to it\'s weak acting . \nthis film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it\'s rewarding and extremely worthwhile . \nit really shouldn\'t be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it\'s first hit movie . \n',1
' \" last night \" could have an \" aka \" tagged on the end of it that says , \" it\'s the end of the world , and we feel fine \" . \n \" last night \" is about just that . \nthe last night of planet earth\'s existence . \nthe world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . \nhow scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . \nnor is the event itself . \nthroughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening . \nin doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . \nhe\'s attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . \nthe film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . \nmckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . \nthe film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . \nthere\'s mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . \nher husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . \nfinally , there\'s mckellar\'s friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . \nmckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i\'ve seen in a film in months . \nthese people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . \nwe can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . \nrennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . \nhe exudes such charm and likeablity , it\'s not surprising that we\'re rooting for him to get what he wants . \nbut for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . \ni knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . \nhis insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . \nhe doesn\'t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone\'s going to die , he should immediately find some companionship . \nhe realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . \nmckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . \nmy only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . \ni really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . \ni appreciate the fact that mckellar didn\'t want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . \nhowever , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth\'s destruction is , he\'s left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . \nanother problem is we never see anybody panicking . \ni would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds . \ninstead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it\'s new year\'s eve . \ni just didn\'t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . \nno one had the urge to \" rage against the dying of the light \" . \ndespite these small problems , \" last night \" is one of the best movies of the year . \nas opposed to the moronic \" armageddon \" , \" last night \" treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . \nand bruce willis never shows up to save the day . \n',1
' \" he\'s back , and it\'s about time . \" \nwas the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don\'t care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . \nthe motto was well chosen . \nthe series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . \nas good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . \nis it the acting ? \nhell , no ! \npaul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who\'ve played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . \nhe looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . \ndaphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor\'s first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . \nyoung yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i\'ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . \nthe only problem with the acting is eric roberts . \none time he had to say to mcgann\'s doctor , \" i always dress for the occasion . \" \nbut he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , \" i always . . . \ndress . . . \nfor the occasion . \" \nyou need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who\'s also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . \nexecutive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . \ni dunno who thought of casting him , but if they\'re reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! \nhe rides on his sister\'s coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . \nis this problem the kisses to the past ? \nthey have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they\'re good . \nis it the script or the movie as a whole ? \nthe script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . \nso what is it ? \nsimple : no plot . \nthe master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . \nthe doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee\'s help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn\'t close it by then . \nvirtually no plot . \ni was told the movie would\'ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . \nthat shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would\'ve gotten a four star rating out of me . \n',1
'all those who were offended by there\'s something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . \nand while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . \namerican pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . \ni must question the studio that releases a movie like this . \nthe producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . \nsome have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . \namerican pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . \nit is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . \namerican pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . \njim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . \njim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . \' . \nof course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . \nthere are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . \namerican pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . \ni loved the young cast in this movie . \nconsider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . \nbiggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . \nbut in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television\'s sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim\'s uneasy father . \nscenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . \nafter levy discovers jim\'s new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . \nbut i never used baked goods . \' \nit is performances such as his , and bill murray\'s in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . \nthere are some less-than-original aspects of the film . \na bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we\'ve seen before . \nif weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother\'s dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . \nsecondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . \nbut at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it\'s own , biggs asks his buddies why he\'s going through so much pressure for something that\'s `not very important anyway . \' \nand so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . \nin it\'s own way . \n',1
'bob the happy bastard\'s quickie review : \nthe mummy \nbrendan fraser\'s stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . \nfraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . \nit\'s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . \nbut who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can\'t get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . \nfraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . \nbasically , it\'s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . \nhis plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . \nof course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising\'s kevin j . o\'connor ) and some \" americans \" . . . and \nguess what ? \nyup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . \nfire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep\'s plan begins to unfold . \nok , so it\'s not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . \nthe special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn\'t half bad either . \nthe action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . \nno , it\'s no phantom menace beater , but if you\'re looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won\'t find a better film under wraps than the mummy . \nif this doesn\'t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will . \n',1
'the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster \nthe big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \nthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . \nwhen those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . \nwhen the life is that of jeff \" the dude \" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of \" what\'sgoingonaroundhere \" . \nthe marvelous sound of \" the stranger \" ( sam elliot ) \'s voice-over introduces the film . \nat least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . \nthe dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the \" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world \" , although he\'s not so much slothful as he is relaxed . \nspending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn\'t have much of a life , but he\'s having a good time . \nwhen asked what he does for fun , he responds \" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback \" . \nlebowski\'s passion is bowling . \nwhen he\'s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . \narriving home one night , he\'s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . \neven worse , they urinate on his rug . \nthe problem is that the dude doesn\'t have a wife . \nhis assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . \nthe \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . \nthe next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake\'s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . \nthe carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it\'s virtually the only object there . \nwhen he\'s denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . \non his way out , he runs into lebowski\'s trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton\'s favorites for a thousand bucks . \nthe penniless dude wisecracks that he\'s heading for the cash machine . \nlater he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny\'s kidnappers . \nthis begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . \nthe kidnappers are impossibly inept . \nthe dude and his cronies are even worse . \nevery plan goes awry . \nyou can almost see lebowski\'s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . \nthat\'s the story , but to tell the truth it doesn\'t much matter . \nthere could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . \nthe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . \nthe dude\'s bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you\'d see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they\'re not quite what they seem . \nwalter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . \neverything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . \nwhen a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won\'t admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . \ndonny gets precious few words in between walter\'s screaming and the dude\'s rambling . \nwhen he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . \ndonny is \" out of his league \" and doesn\'t \" have a frame of reference \" . \nthe film is peppered with people for whom the term \" character \" would be an understatement . \nthe big lebowski\'s daughter maude , an avant-garde \" vaginal \" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . \nthe kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . \nbunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . \nmost impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . \nas the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . \nthe camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with \" jesus \" ( pronounced with a \" j \" , not an \" h \" ) embroidered on the pocket . \nhe addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . \nhis tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . \nbridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . \ni can\'t think of anyone else who could have done a better job . \nbuscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . \nthe more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he\'s one of the treasures of our time . \nit\'s odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr\'s television husband . \nmore like the coen\'s \" raising arizona \" than their hit \" fargo \" , \" the big lebowski \" demands an open mind and even more open eyes . \na mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . \nthere\'s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . \nwalking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . \non further examination , i wasn\'t sure exactly what it was . \n \" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it\'s not going to be what you expect \" ? \n \" when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling \" ? \nmaybe there\'s no real message . \nperhaps it\'s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world . \nmaybe that\'s enough . \n ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about \" the man in the iron mask \" starring that favorite of 14-year-old girls of all ages . \nredman@bvoice .

'america has finally gotten what it\'s needed for years : a compassionate sincere president with impressive ethics and charisma . \nregretfully it\'s only a movie . \npresident james marshall ( harrison ford ) is fed up with terrorist activities . \nteaming up with the russian government , he orders a strike force capture of alexander radek , a reactionary general ready to re-unite the soviet union under his fascist reign . \nduring a celebration dinner , marshall announces to the world that he will send troops to fight oppression wherever it exists . \n \" it\'s your turn to be afraid , \" he declares . \nreturning home on air force one , he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally . \nultra-nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov ( gary oldman ) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released . \nmarshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule ( which clinton says doesn\'t exist in real life ) but refuses , preferring to stay and fight . \ndirector wolfgang peterson ( \" das boot \" , \" in the line of fire \" , \" outbreak \" takes the over-used \" die hard \" theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold-your-breath intensity . \nif you can take your eyes off the screen , steal a look at the audience . \neveryone is totally engrossed . \nthe two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it . \noldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder -- he does it so well . \nwhen he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead , you know that he\'s over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become . \nyou are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time . \nwhen korshonov executes passengers , there is a frightening reality to it . \nthe guns in this film are deadly weapons , not cartoons . \nharrison ford has done one role for several years . \nhis mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here . \nmarshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job . \nrealistically , he\'s a man afraid , but not afraid to act . \nford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero . \nindiana jones in the oval office . \nhe and oldman\'s archetypes match up perfectly . \nthe other roles also go to accomplished actors . \nglenn close as the determined but unsure vice-president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she\'s not quite ready for . \ndean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority ( \" i\'m in charge here ! \" ) \nis her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance . \nof course the politics are all wrong . \na cowboy president ( even down to his name ) with big guns shoots his way through problems . \nmuch like the american collective memory of jfk\'s camelot , the image is wondrous if you don\'t look too deep . \nthe pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film , but they work here . \nno matter what political spin you put on the story , the movie is an outstanding one . \ni left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country\'s future : not a common belief nowadays . \nnow if we only can get ford to run for president . \njust because one actor didn\'t work out as chief executive doesn\'t mean that a different one couldn\'t . \n ( michael redman has lost count of how many years he\'s been writing this column -- 21 years . . . 22 years -- while watching the sunflowers outside his window swaying in the cool breezes . ) \n',1
'the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate . \npeople are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . \nafter a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . \nthe basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . \nthe things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . \nthe plot in this movie really isn\'t that important to the thing though . \nthis movie has very good special effects , for the most part . \nthe techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well . \nbruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city . \none day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . \nthis movie is about what happens . \nthe plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . \nalso there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . \nsome characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag . \nbruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . \nthe movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . \nit is one of those sci-fi films where you\'ll be saying \" cool \" followed by a \" what the hell ? ! ? ! \" . \ni give the fifth element . \n',1
'i can sum up first strike in one word : awesome . \nnever in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan . \nfor the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he\'s ever appeared in , he should be awarded greatly . \nthe same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan\'s rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well . \nhowever , first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three , for the simple reason that practice makes perfect . \nhis last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great . \nlike rumble , this film is about the mafia , the former kgb . \nnow chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men . \nthe trailer for the film sums it up quite well . \nfirst strike is action-packed , but the fight scenes are so fast and furious , they almost have a witty , italian-like humor to them . \njackie chan is a regular comedian . \nwell , he\'s no eddie murphy , but he can really crack you up . \nfor example , he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him , as he claims to be the korean 007 ( that\'s secret agent james bond ) . \neven the plot to this film improved above the others , as a sort-of twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame . \nbut never fear , as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident . \nwith some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy , first strike is a sure-fire hit that\'s guaranteed to draw some major , world-wide attention . \n , \n',1
'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \nit\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\' 1988 film wings of desire . \ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\'t a rip-off of its source material . \nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \nthat\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , \" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . \" \n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \nsince i love this film so much , i\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\'t perfect . \nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \nhe\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \nhe\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \nit\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \n',1
'back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie \" antz \" . \nthe film was critically acclaimed , and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office . \nagain in 1998 they released their traditional animated film \" the prince of egypt \" and it named an instant classic , and became a huge hit as well . \non a winning streak , they released \" the road to el dorado \" and it wasn\'t as big as they hoped , but still did ok , then they had the fantastic \" chicken run \" in the summer . \nnow in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films . \nshrek ( mike myers ) is about a loving , green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself . \nsurrounded by fairy tale characters , he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone . \nthe ruler of duloc is the short , heartless lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) , who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures , if they are captured and arrested . \nof course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver , but one of those creatures is donkey ( eddie murphy ) . \na regular donkey , except he talks and has a definite attitude , after his owner tries to disown him , he escapes into the woods , and runs into shrek . \nlord farquaad however , has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek\'s house . \nto get his property back , and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) so lord farquaad can be a king . \nshrek wants his property back , but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona . \n \" shrek \" is such an amazing film , that while watching it you can\'t help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can\'t make movies like this . \nthe animated graphics are so great , that they look every bit of realistic . \ni saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be . \ni must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year . \nthe voice talents are brilliant as well , with the comic genius mike myers . \nin the past he has been a wayne , an austin , and a person married to an ax murderer . \nnow he is shrek , not only does he do the voice talent . . . but he is shrek . \nwith his irish accent , and he lovable personality , shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart . \neddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s \" mulan \" does another bang up job here , and he is the comic relief in the film . \nthe tones of his voice , the lines he utters , and the jokes he gives , he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in \" aladdin \" . \nthe always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well . \nshe is very funny , and her character fits her to a t . of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow , who is personally one of my favorite actors . \nhe as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time . \nat times i was so amazed by the computer graphics , that you can\'t help but just start looking at backgrounds . \nthere is many hidden jokes in the film , and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera . \n \" shrek \" is a definite kid film , but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy . \nthere are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won\'t get , but the parents will be laughing . \nbelieve me though , everyone will be laughing the entire way through . \nin the end , \" shrek \" gives a very important message to it\'s audience to enjoy and be who you are . \neverybody out there is beautiful in their own way , even though it may be inside . \nthere\'s not many words that can praise \" shrek \" enough , but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now . \n',1
'you don\'t have to know poker to like \" rounders , \" but it might help . \nthat a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of new york\'s cardshark underground astoundingly doesn\'t limit its accessibility , even for those who can\'t tell royal and straight flushes apart . \n \" rounders \" \' success , then , is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with . \nthe dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp , but you don\'t have to speak the language to understand the words - a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show . \nmatt damon , fresh off his \" good will hunting \" hot streak , is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott , a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling . \nbut after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high-stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb ( john malkovich , deliciously hammy ) , he shifts his focus to scholarly matters , leaving his true area of expertise far , far behind . \nthings change , however , when mike\'s old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend\'s superlative skills to help him pay off the debt . \nthat \" rounders \" \' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn\'t hinder its potency . \ndirector john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs \" red rock west \" and \" the last seduction , \" gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm . \ndamon and norton bring so much to their roles that they\'d be worth catching even if \" rounders \" ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . \nany sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . \nif only the other character interaction was as successful , \" rounders \" might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year\'s best films . \ncurrent \" it girl \" gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike\'s girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective . \njohn turturro\'s aging mentor and famke janssen\'s tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time . \nand as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that\'s mostly a plot device - he\'s on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for \" rounders \" \' moral . \nthat moral , by the way , is \" our destiny chooses us , \" and it\'s something of a surprise when \" rounders \" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be . \nin the end , \" rounders \" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture . \nthe road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be . \nhere , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren\'t cut out for the cards . \nscreenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that\'s often generalized by movies ; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene . \ninside every adventurous filmgoer , there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting , and that\'s the precise allure of \" rounders . \" \nit ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we\'ve seen before , because the final destination is a satisfying one . \nin the end , \" rounders \" holds a winning hand . \n',1
'after hearing reviews for woody allen\'s upteenth movie in history , \" celebrity , \" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of \" manhattan , \" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . \nwoody allen\'s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( \" manhattan \" really is one of the best-looking films i\'ve ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city\'s best areas , etc . ) , a fan can\'t help but feel visibly moved . \nthe film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word \" help \" being spelled with an airplane . \nbeethoven\'s 5th blasts on the soundtrack . \nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it\'s all rather lovely to look at . \nand then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film\'s hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something\'s wrong with her life or whatever . \nit\'s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year\'s \" deconstructing harry \" came awfully close ) . \nwhat the hell has happened to him ? \nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \n \" bullets over broadway , \" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \n \" mighty aphrodite \" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \n \" everyone says i love you \" was more of a great idea than a great film . \neven \" deconstructing harry \" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . \nif anything , the reception of \" celebrity \" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it\'s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it\'s him . \n \" celebrity \" is , yes , a good film , but it\'s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . \ninstead of creating the great woody allen world , he\'s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . \nand he\'s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . \nit\'s like \" la dolce vita \" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . \nwoody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . \nmuch has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh\'s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o\' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . \nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character\'s flaws to be more apparent . \nwoody\'s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he\'s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . \nbranagh\'s allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we\'re still not sure if he\'s really a good person or not . \nhis character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . \nwe then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . \nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie \" but with a deep personal crisis \" ) . \nas such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . \nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is \" polymorphously perverse \" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of \" la dolce vita . \" \nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . \nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . \nwhile lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( \" i\'ve become the kind of woman i\'ve always hated . . . and \ni\'m loving it . \" ) \nwithout doing a thing . \nthe result is a film of highs and mediums . \nthe mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don\'t exactly work but you can\'t help but pat allen on the back for trying . \nbut other places are really great scenes . \nthe opening . \nthe sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn\'t ended . \na banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . \nand , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they\'d never look at him the same way . \nhe ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him . \nthey go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . \nallen\'s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i\'d almost recommend the film . \nalmost . \nbut what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it\'s a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it\'s still a smart and insightful film . \nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it\'d be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . \nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they\'re really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis\' character . \nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm\'s length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . \nbesides , it\'s witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen\'s : that great woody allen feel . \nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen\'s oeuvre , it\'s merely a blip ( no \" annie hall \" but it\'s no \" shadows and fog \" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice . \n',1
'the idea at the center of the devil\'s advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- \" the last humanist \" . \nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , \" vanity -- by far my favorite sin \" . \nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( \" lemme givya a piece o\' inside wisdom on god . . . \" , \" i have a million names . . . \" ) , as john milton -- the devil . \nthe main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam\'s the time bandits . \nbut the film , is something else , something original . \npart of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn\'t try to become any profound study of power . \nthis is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . \nit is also entertaining . \nthere is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind\'s eye . \nthe final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen\'s fargo . \nthe central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james\' the turn of the screw , and oates\' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . \nits nice to know that things like this are still being made . \n',1
'there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie\'s end . \non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that\'s fallen into the same category over the last few years . \nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who\'s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \nat times , however , zeik\'s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise\'s computer disk . \nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie\'s open . \nconsidering these factors it\'s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it\'s another good bet this month . \nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it\'s definitely worth the visit . \n',1
'susan granger\'s review of \" legally blonde \" ( m . g . m . ) \nit\'s a \" pretty in pink \" / \" clueless \" coming-of-age story for the new millennium as elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend ( matthew davis ) . \nthe girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : \" if i\'m going to be a senator by the time i\'m 30 . . . i \nneed to marry a jackie , not a marilyn . \" \ndetermined to prove she\'s as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country-club connecticut , elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty . \nonce there , this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) . \nin the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there\'s wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving . \nfirst-time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who\'s joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon-to-be-published novel by amanda brown . \nthe supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink , her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" legally blonde \" is a frivolous , funny , feel-good 8 . \nfilled with ditzy blonde ambition , it\'s a movie for high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see . \n',1
'with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late \'90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically . \nfor the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer\'s incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards . \nlola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day . \nit seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn\'t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed . \nthis gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies . \nso she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she\'ll be able to obtain the money and save a life . \n>from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like \" sliding doors on steroids . \nwith a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something . \nindeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious . \nvery much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film . \nthe way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer\'s movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) . \nthematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash . \nwhile you are watching , this will not matter . \nrunning a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . \nit is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n',1
'time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe . \nthis map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time . \nthe supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map . . \nduring the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen . \nbut , according to randall , they are just \" borrowing \" it . \nkevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling . \nhe joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies . \ntheir first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding . \nfrom here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself . \neventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery . \nkevin accidentally saved the king\'s life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son . \nbut the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic . \nmeanwhile , the evil genius ( david warner ) is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness , attempting to find a way in order to bring the men , and the map , to him . \nwhen randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness , which supposedly contains \" the most fabulous object in the world \" , the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes , as he is convinced that they must travel there . \nonce inside the fortress of ultimate darkness , it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive . \ntime bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone . \nwith a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone . \nterry gilliam , however , does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film , although this does not affect the film that greatly . \nand finally , if you liked labyrinth , you\'ll love time bandits . \n',1
' \" the celebration \" is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant . \nyou know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you\'ve heard about it before , you just can\'t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs . \ni prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like . \ni don\'t really feel there are to be any real \" rules \" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work . \nbut i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences . \nwhen i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me . \n \" the celebration \" is great because it\'s chock full of those . \nit creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life . \nand then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you\'re paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you\'re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up . \nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . \nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . \nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father\'s home . \nhis brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . \nwe then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she\'s going to . \nonce they\'re all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film\'s punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it\'s all terribly interesting to watch . \ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . \nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . \nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . \" \ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department . \nit feels like reality , like you\'re actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . \nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . \nwe see key moments in people\'s lives that they wouldn\'t dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it\'s not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn\'t have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \nand yes , it\'s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he\'s done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . \nthe actors or writers have not made the

'books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . \nthis is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . \nthe special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . \nliterally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . \nand now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . \nmuch has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . \nsome fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday\'s star wars updated with today\'s special effects wizardry . \neither way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . \ncan there be anyone in the world who doesn\'t know what star wars is about ? \nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \nit\'s a story about a young man\'s coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven\'t been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \nit\'s high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it\'s just an _experience_ . \nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \nit\'s about to do so again . \nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film\'s devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \n ) . \npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn\'t do it justice . \nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \nit\'s really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \neven letterboxing doesn\'t make up for the decrease in size and definition . \nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i\'ll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \ngo and see it more than once . . . it \nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it\'s gone this time . \ntake along the youngsters who\'ve never had the big-screen star wars experience--you\'ll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \nthere\'s magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it\'s still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \nlet\'s all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \n',1
'it\'s no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . \na poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . \nin directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . \nin addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . \nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . \njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . \nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . \nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there\'s no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn\'t believe their eyes the first time . \nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan\'s performance . \nhe works perfectly with the script , and it\'s quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . \nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . \nwe\'re quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . \ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . \nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . \nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . \nit\'s here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . \nrattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn\'t quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year\'s grosse pointe blank . \nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . \nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . \nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . \nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it\'s tucker\'s toned-down routine or chan\'s tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . \na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed . \n',1
'capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present . \nrobert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando ) . \nedward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime . \nthe plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense . \n , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \ni am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before . \nthis is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens . \nthere are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment . \nthere is no rock score . \nthere are no ballet- like martial arts . \nthis is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script . \nnick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks . \nif a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out . \nsometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe . \nwhen one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game . \nhe returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time . \nhe proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett ) . \nshe has one condition . \nhe must stay retired from crime . \nbut before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick . \nnick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal . \nmore and more details seem to complicate the job . \nnick\'s partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton ) . \njack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates\' homes . \nthe young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way . \ntogether they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house . \nthe script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old \" mission impossible \" television series . \nwe see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of \" mission impossible . \" \nthis team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise \" mission impossible \" films . \nthe complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable . \nthe telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be . \ndirector frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film . \nthe score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting . \nedward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today\'s standards . \nhe plays what is nearly a double role . \njack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house . \none nice ( ? ) \ncharacter i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold ) . \nstephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother\'s basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions . \nhe seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon . \nthe film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist . \nthen the pace really picks up . \nbefore that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes . \nthough oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown . \non the subject of music , the score of the score is by howard shore . \nit adds tension to the suspense scenes , but never seems to have much of a melody . \nangela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break . \nshe has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does . \nspeaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s . \nit does the job . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n',1
'my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we\'ve all seen a million times ) , two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins . \nthis is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . \nthe movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . \nwilliam haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . \nthere is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . \nhe finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . \nthis movie was exceptional for many reasons . \none being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . \nthey worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly , one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i\'ll let you fiqure which is which ) . \nalso , they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . \nit seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) . \nexperience counts for a lot ! ! \n',1
' \" footloose \" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . \nand i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . \nthe movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . \nhe ends up falling for the preacher\'s daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . \nas mentioned at the beginning of this review , \" footloose \" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . \nthere are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . \nso why did i enjoy it so much ? \nfor one thing , the cast is great . \nkevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . \nwe\'re rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn\'t play him as the \" rebel without a clue \" sort . \nyes , he does rebel , but he\'s also polite when he needs to be . \nand he never broods . \nthe rest of the cast is equally impressive . \njohn lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . \nbut lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . \nby the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . \nanother nice touch is the music . \nwe see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with \" sexual innuendos \" , but that\'s not true at all . \nthe title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun . \nduring the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing . \nof course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . \nanyway , \" footloose \" is a charming little surprise . \ndon\'t let the premise prevent you from watching it . \nit sucked me in , and it\'ll do the same to you . \n',1
'on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail . \nhe says to a black congregation \" . . . if you can\'t cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you\'re never gonna get rid of me . \" ) \nwell , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy . \nbeatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california . \nthe movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth\'s latest commercials condemning affirmative action . \nthe montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy . \nwhen we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days . \nhis campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care . \nfirst he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter\'s name . \nthen he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination . \nhis assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth\'s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements . \nbulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience . \nhe is hit hard with questions about his voting record . \nhe had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn\'t shown up . \nsince he\'s a dead man anyway , he figures he\'ll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity . \nthey made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made . \nthe shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers . \n ( before i go further , i\'d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j . \nfans is not part of bulworth\'s \" truth . \" \nthat line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie . \nwhen the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they\'re talking about . ) \nthe experience is liberating . \nwith nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth . \nhe can say whatever he wants because he\'s going to be dead anyway . \nwhy not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? \nbulworth\'s candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . \nhe feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . \nchicken wings , appropriately enough . \nbulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . \nwhen one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . \nwith so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can\'t hollywood make a quality product . \n ( you go , warren ! ) \nwhen they become indignant and ask why he\'s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it\'s because they are rich jews . \nthat night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . \nhe stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . \nthe next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . \nfrom then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . \nhis rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . \nhe\'s not very good , but it is his first try and at least he\'s not embarrassingly bad . \nhis lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . \neventually , the movie\'s plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) \novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth\'s political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth\'s depression , then liberation and rebirth . \nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood\'s indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \nit\'s too bad that there aren\'t more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \njust don\'t expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \n',1
'the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \nit\'s not a pretty death , and it\'s leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999\'s the matrix , can be a real gem . \nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \nmostly it\'s laughable . \nin hollywood\'s rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey\'s fight against oppression . \niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \n',1
'it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival\'s palme d\'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard\'s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \'70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens\' bare feet . \nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn\'t match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino\'s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \nand there aren\'t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \nthere\'s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that\'s about it . \njackie brown\'s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \nthis isn\'t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\'s courage under fire . \nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\'s unconventional . \nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \'70s icon . \nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\'s career , tarantino uses a \'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \nshe\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\'s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \njackie passes ordell\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\'s foot fetish . \nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \nit\'s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \n',1
'review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) \ncast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole\' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch \nrating : good shot ( stars ) \nlanguid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman . \njuxtaposing the samurai\'s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor\'s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era . \ndirector jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit . \nusing a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film . \nhe doesn\'t cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies . \nthe action is presented in flat , brutal codas . \nbullets have permanence . \ndeath has consequences . \nthe movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty . \nit is an anti-movie , of sorts . \nthere are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with . \nthis isn\'t a film that lovingly holds your hand . \nthere are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see . \nthe fulcrum for the movie\'s thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman . \na twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms . \nunlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing . \nhe wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance . \nthere are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal . \nhe uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion . \nghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai . \nlife consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books . \nghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \nhe craves nothing more . \nas he puts it late in the film , \" i\'ve seen all i want to see . \" \nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \nghost dog wasn\'t always as he is presented . \nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that \" samaritan \" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill \" handsome frank \" , a made man within louie\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\'s world . \neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \nit\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\'s surrealistic nature . \nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \nby film\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \nthe other person in ghost dog\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost\'s dog\'s sense of honor . ) \nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\'s use , his face . \nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \n',1
'a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . \na prime example of this is 1999\'s 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . \nless successful was last year\'s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . \nnow comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare\'s tragedies . \nlike 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team\'s standout player . \njulia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke\'s hamlet , plays desi brable , odin\'s girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . \njosh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . \no was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . \nthe movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? \n- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . \nan air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . \nand that is how it should be . \nof all of shakespeare\'s tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . \nkaaya\'s profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . \nthe young man considers himself the basketball team\'s prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . \nplus his father , the team\'s coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . \nthe script follows the familiar lines of the classic . \nhugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi\'s fidelity , eroding the star\'s confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . \nit all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . \nthe performances in o vary . \nphifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . \nhe also does quite well displaying odin\'s darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . \nhartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . \nstiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . \nthe film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo\'s theft of the school mascot is left hanging . \nalso desi\'s actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin\'s former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo\'s machinations , is puzzling . \nwhy she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . \nit is irrational . \nbut these are minor carpings . \noverall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . \nif nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . \n',1
'it\'s been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \nwith the release of the studio\'s newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough\'s creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \nit\'s no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan\'s parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o\'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who\'s accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \nof course , there\'s the professor\'s daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it\'s a fantastic accomplishment . \nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \nthere are important questions raised about tarzan\'s place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn\'t expecting to find here . \nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk\' from ghost . \ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who\'s not aware of his world\'s dangers . \nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv\'s millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \nas the movie\'s villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods\' hilarious hades from hercules . \na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \ni never expected rice burrough\'s work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \n',1
'just look back two years ago at the coen brothers\' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you\'ve got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby\'s novel high fidelity came first ) . \neither way , it\'s been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \nwhy is this ? \nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they\'re fictional . \ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else\'s pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can\'t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \nbut these aren\'t any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob\'s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob\'s own lifestyle . \nit also helps open the viewer\'s eyes as to how annoying barry is . \njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn\'t end when it should have ended . \ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \n',1
'billed as a \" feminist sex fantasy \" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . \ncamille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . \nhowever , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film\'s decidedly pro-porn stance . \npolitical considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles\' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . \nin the backdrop , however is bubbles\' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . \nthis femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . \nin addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . \nwhen his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . \nthese proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . \ngod herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a \" her \" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . \nthis bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . \nmaking her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary \'straight\' actresses to shame . \nhartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven\'t used her bountiful talents . \nit is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of \" boogie nights \" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . \nmaking a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . \nthe other performances are equally solid . \ndaniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . \nshauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . \noverall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . \nat one point , the title character declares that \" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work \" . \nthe direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . \nroberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . \nthe love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . \nthe musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70\'s porn and psychedelia . \namazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . \nthis speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . \nbubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . \nit\'s funny , sexy and subversive . \nand it shouldn\'t be missed . \n',1
'the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam . \n ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . ) \nwhile driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt . \nmaj . archie gates\' ( who\'s steering ) command requests a beach boys tune . \nthese men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles . \nour three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don\'t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it\'s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs . \nthey are gates , new father sgt . \ntroy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt . \nchief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt . \nconrad vig ( music video director jonze ) . \nat story\'s start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends . \nbarlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an \" ass-map \" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion . \ngates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt . \nditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy . \nso is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam\'s men are threatening the dictator\'s detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence . \nwhen gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help . \n ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . ) \ngates convinces the vault\'s guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck . \nthe situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges . \nbut the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces . \nthe result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime . \nbarlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device . \nhis interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child . \n ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . ) \ni liked these scenes best , because the political became personal . \nit\'s one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it\'s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib . \nrussell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man\'s affair with his bedridden mother . \n ( it\'s great . ) \nhis second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish . \none could argue that it\'s easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence . \nwhen barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we\'re paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast . \nthree kings is russell\'s first visually arresting picture . \nstylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas . \nnewton thomas sigel\'s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate . \none practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen . \n ( a friend enthusiastically added , \" it\'s like having sand in your eyes . \" ) \nthis also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade . \n ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . ) \nrussell throws plenty at sigel\'s camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell\'s previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film\'s most realistic , even the most poignant . \n ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . ) \nif anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us . \nits climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell . \nsubsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow\'s post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status . \n ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . ) \nclooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , \" let my people go ! \" \nhayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell\'s filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture . \n ( it\'s not spoiling much to write that . ) \nthen again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ? \n ( there\'s already enough cynicism in the film\'s mentioning of kuwait\'s oil-infested waters . ) \nrussell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared . \nif he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded . \nwith flair . \n',1
'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . \nfor many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . \nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \nin his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn\'t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \nmurron\'s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace\'s rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn\'t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn\'t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven\'s ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \nwhat makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \nhowever , even those who don\'t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren\'t as effective as they should be . \nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman\'s general ) is also very good as wallace\'s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \ndavid o\'harra is very entertaining as wallace\'s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \ncatherine mccormack as wallace\'s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \n',1
'as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . \nyou know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a \" to kill \" list for his enemies . \noscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . \nas gibson delivers lines like , \" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , \" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind . \noddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure . \nat times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun . \ni probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend . \nsome of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it . \nlike emmerich\'s id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all . \nsure it\'s predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism . \nand isn\'t that the point of the patriot ? \ngibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away . \nhe is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) . \nas the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields . \nbut when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) . \nforming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army . \nthe best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right . \nevery time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis\' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment . \nand as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable . \nas for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done . \nclearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating . \nyou really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period . \neverything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge . \nit\'s organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective . \nthere is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin\'s take-no-prisoners method . \nwhat drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington . \nplayed wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact . \nthis character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil . \nhis portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as \" cowardly \" and \" sadistic . \" \ni disagree with this accusation . \ntavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general . \nbesides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized . \nand stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ? \nheck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ? \nthe patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks . \nwith an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it\'s a lethal weapon for the colonial times . \ngod bless america ! \nand god bless the patriot ! \n',1
'i swear i have seen the edge before . \nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \nbut taking scream\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \nfor once , we don\'t immediately care for the main character . \ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \ncharles\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \ncharles , bob , bob\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \nbut given the charles\' intelligence , and bob\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \nthinking . \" \ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\'t as it seems anymore . \ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \nshe isn\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \ndavid mamet\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \nit\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \nway to go , bart . \n',1
'just how inseparable is the team of sgt . \nmartin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt . \nroger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ? \nlet\'s just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it ! \nthe familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs\' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye . \nnew to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective . \ntrouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception . \neven when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship . \nwe here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen . \ngunfire ensues , and when it\'s all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord . \nalthough they don\'t know what they\'re looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action . \nand there\'s plenty of action here for two movies . \nled by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to . \nli is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives . \nthere are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore . \nit\'s a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun . \nbut even too many explosions can get boring . \nto counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li . \nluckily , he\'d rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns . \nmeanwhile , when the detectives aren\'t reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they\'re engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets . \neverybody gets in on the shtick . \nrusso screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he\'s being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones . \ngibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano . \nscore one for the old guard . \n',1
'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \nyes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\'harra , han\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\'s sister years ago . \nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \ni\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\'t like that particular genre . \n',1
' \" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred \" . \na blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off . \nbut no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento\'s most consistently successful film . \nwhat impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento\'s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative . \nscreenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . \nno question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . \nfortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called \" suspiria de profundis \" . \nthe film\'s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . \njessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . \narriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . \nwhat happens next - and i don\'t make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock\'s infamous shower scene in psycho . \nit\'s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento\'s own . \nthough nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria\'s opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . \nwe meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well . \nseveral more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn\'t want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film\'s climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that\'s most impressive . \nthe english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . \nfortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . \nthe dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . \nand the soundtrack ? \nit is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . \nas it stands , the use of goblin\'s music in suspiria is outstanding . \napparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . \na stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer\'s overall experience . \neven better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you\'ll get the added bonus of widescreen . \nand the colours ! \ndeep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . \nthe cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . \na nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . \nthese kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento\'s more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . \nsuspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . \nthe gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that\'s always been one of argento\'s shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror . \n',1
'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . \nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . \nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . \nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . \nand when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . \nfincher\'s the game is no exception to this . \nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . \nfincher hasn\'t made a film since \" seven , \" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . \nso it is about time he made another film . \nand what a ride it is . \nthe game isn\'t quite as powerful as \" seven , \" but in some ways it is better . \noverall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . \nit walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . \nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . \nunfortunately , unlike \" the usual suspects , \" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . \nhowever , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . \nthe game is told completely from its main character\'s point of view . \nnicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . \nhe lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . \nfor his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \n \" it will make your life fun again , \" his brother promises . \nas skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . \nseeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . \njim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \n \" each game is suited to each person\'s emotional and psychological needs , \" explains feingold . \none day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . \neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . \nwhat he doesn\'t realize is that the game has already begun . \nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas\' way . \nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . \nthe detail involved in fincher\'s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . \nwith \" seven , \" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . \nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . \ncompared to \" seven , \" though , the game is light and comical . \nbecause of this film\'s sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . \nso don\'t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn\'t want you to . \nwhat does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . \nif taken as it is , the game\'s ending makes complete sense . \nbut if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . \nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film . \nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . \nwe don\'t really care if douglas\' character lives or not because it isn\'t believable . \nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . \nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . \ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . \nhis character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . \ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into ? \nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . \nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\' brother . \ndeborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\' predicament . \nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . \nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\' did . \nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\'s best films . \n',1
'earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . \na real charmer of a movie , it\'s possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . \nnow , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . \nthere\'s no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing . \nthe plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland . \nned\'s prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . \nenter jackie o\'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o\'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . \nthe two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he\'s actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . \nian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael . \njackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . \nthe two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience . \nevery viewer is sure to like both of them . \nthere are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . \nthis appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it\'s a tad bit unnecessary . \noverall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . \nthe ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout . \nthe kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff . \nin a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial . \nit\'s the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes . \nthere\'s nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . \nindeed , it\'s one of the year\'s best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss . \n',1
'john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . \nso effortlessly that people tend to forget he\'s there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor\'s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . \nexample : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn\'t be more divergent--- i\'ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! \nwas a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn\'t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . \ni muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . \nshe responded with her usual query , \" whose in that one ? \" \nthis is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . \nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . \nanyway , when i answered \" john cusack \" , she replied with a rather stunned \" who ? \" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . \nnow i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it\'s understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . \ni showed her a picture of cusack\'s mug in the paper hoping for an \" oh - him , yes he\'s quite good \" instead i got a \" no - i don\'t know him \" . \nat this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack\'s relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . \ncu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . \ni\'m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as \" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) \" . \nhe\'s not a brand name , and his movies usually aren\'t big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he\'s kind of a genius . \nwith his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90\'s . \nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . \ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he\'s a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . \nand he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin\'s and val kilmer\'s seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . \nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it\'s a hit . \nit was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . \nit\'s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . \nhigh fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his \" top 5 break ups list \" . \nthis is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller\'s day off . \nat first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack\'s witty delivery . \nhe\'s the kind of guy we don\'t mind talking directly to us . \ngradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it\'s all very existential ) . \nthough that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . \nthe best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis\' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . \nhe\'s the kind of guy i\'m sure we\'ve all met before , a blowhard who thinks he\'s always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . \nbut i like this guy , because of how black plays him . \nthe actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . \nhe\'s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . \n ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . \nbut fears and black never let that happen . \nthe character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . \nhe\'s over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . \ncatherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own \" charm \" . \ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . \nthe one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . \ni give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it\'s hard to see why cusack\'s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . \nthis reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those \" special people \" whose wheels turn a little slower ) . \nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i\'d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . \nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . \nfears\' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i\'m beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i\'ll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . \nbut cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . \ni\'m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . \nhis character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . \n',1
'the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it\'s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . \nwe soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo\'s ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . \nhowever , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . \nno sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . \nit seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas\'s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . \nwe\'re the fans , not the freaks . \nwe won\'t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won\'t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we\'re throwing down . \nall right , stop looking at me like that . \nwe have been faithfully and patiently waiting . \nwaiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . \nyou see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . \nunfortunately , it is not our savior . \nfor weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . \nanything less and it\'ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . \ni didn\'t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn\'t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . \ncharacter development is virtually nonexistent . \nwith the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film\'s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . \nnone seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . \ncontrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . \njar jar\'s life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . \nhis speech mannerisms are so \" cute-ified \" that i couldn\'t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . \nhis head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as \" deep doo doo , \" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . \ntherein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . \nin star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a \" wretched hive of scum and villainy . \" \nin the phantom menace , we get doo doo . \nthe films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story \" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . \" \nthis film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it\'s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . \nperhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it\'s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . \ni liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? \nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . \nthis aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . \ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? \ndidn\'t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? \ndidn\'t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? \nof course they did , and it\'s only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . \none aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . \nthe people at lucas\'s industrial light and magic , the world\'s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . \nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation\'s robot army and jar jar\'s countrymen . \nthe space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . \nthis , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . \njohn williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . \nhis music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . \nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . \nas a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . \nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . \none of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film\'s release . \nin spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn\'t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . \nhe has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . \nwith that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . \nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . \nhowever , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . \noddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body\'s cells . \nthis only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . \ndon\'t let me mislead you too far . \nthe phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . \nit contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . \nit\'s just that when held up to it\'s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . \n',1
'what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . \nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! \ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting : \" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! \" \nand , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . \nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . \nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the \'60s tv series ) . \non one hand , nicholson\'s joker is extremely funny . \nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . \nbut on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . \nthe joker\'s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . \nthis guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! \nbut enough about nicholson as the joker : i\'m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . \nlike many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . \nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! \nkeaton delivers . \nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . \neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . \nvisually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . \nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as \" the dark knight returns \" and \" the killing joke . \" \nburton\'s film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . \nthe sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . \nnicholson isn\'t joking when he boasts , \" wait \'till they get a load of me ! \" \nhis grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . \nkeaton\'s wardrobe is equally appropriate . \nbatman\'s cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west\'s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir\'s outfit in robocop . \nproduction designer anton furst\'s sets are a wonder . \ngotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . \nthe batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . \nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . \nthe movie\'s gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . \nthe plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . \nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . \nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . \nbatman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . \nas i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman\'s psychological motives and underpinnings . \nin terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . \nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . \nmore than anything , batman is a mood film . \nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . \nthanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world . \n',1
'i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \nput simply , brooks\' comedy is intelligent . \nmother is albert brooks\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\'s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \nit\'s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \nthere\'s always the big but . \njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \nbrooks\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \nthere\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don\'t want to stay at a hotel . \" \nshe still doesn\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \n \" you\'ve named the ice ? \" \nasks john . \nhe\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \nthat\'s why it\'s smaller than the refrigerator . \" \nit\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \nwhen they\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \nyou don\'t know what the joke was because you couldn\'t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \ni don\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \njohn\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \nin a way , he\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\'s hard to get mad at her character . \nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\'s disease . \nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\'s boy . \nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \na solid connection is not really made between john\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \nbeatrice : you must think i\'m some kind of moron . \njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i\'m a moron . \nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one . \n',1
'i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . \ni\'ve seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . \nbreakdown , then , is something of a surprise . \nrussell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . \nto say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . \nrussell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . \nwhile journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . \nwalsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . \nbecause of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . \nthat , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . \nbreakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer\'s the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg\'s duel and any number of hitchcock films . \nas with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . \njeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . \nwhen we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it\'s too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . \nrussell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . \nj . t . \nwalsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn\'t seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here . \nthe reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable . \nbreakdown is what hollywood doesn\'t make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats . \none of the most genuinely exciting films i\'ve seen in a long time . \n',1
'when i left the theater after seeing david lynch\'s \" lost highway , \" i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , \" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . \" \nin his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture \" eraserhead \" on the weirdness scale . \nyou won\'t \" know \" what happened when it\'s over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses . \nit is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . \ni can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . \nthey are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn\'t help matters any when \" mystery man \" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons\' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . \nthe next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . \nhe is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . \nthe perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee\'s spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . \ni would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn\'t offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . \nthis description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch\'s weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . \non the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch\'s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . \nthe film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . \nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . \nwe , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred\'s , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . \nall of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch\'s typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . \nas is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . \nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on fred\'s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil\'s \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . \nlynch\'s direction and director of photography pete deming\'s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . \nwell , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer\'s attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . \nthe main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn\'t find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film\'s spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . \nlynch\'s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . \nit\'s not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . \nthat said , these minor flaws don\'t prevent \" lost highway \" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . \nit is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective . \n',1

'118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) \nmamoru oshii is a name that probably isn\'t very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . \noshii was the director of last year\'s best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . \none of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . \nin its many incarnations--graphic novels ( \" manga \" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . \nset in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . \nas a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . \nas the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as \" labors \" ( an interesting play on words , considering that \" robot \" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . \nwith the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime . \nthis led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . \nthe patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . \nsometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . \nthose who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . \nthe story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . \nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . \nhowever , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . \nshinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors\' movement speed and efficiency by 30\% . \nthis hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90\% of the nation\'s labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . \nsince that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . \n ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) \nit\'s up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2\'s own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father\'s company down with it . \nas was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . \n_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . \nit is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . \nthere are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . \nthis movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . \npatlabor\'s near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . \nthe film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? \nare history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? \nthis is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor\'s alternate-1999 setting . \nas far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that\'s the only one i\'ve seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . \nthe animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . \nthe oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . \nas far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . \ni don\'t think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . \nthe cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters\' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . \nthe audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . \neven without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . \ngiant robot footsteps are deep and booming . \nthe sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . \nas far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they\'re among the most easily-readable subtitles i\'ve ever seen for _anything_ . \nlarge enough that they don\'t strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . \nalthough it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . \nalthough it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people\'s enjoyment . \nmy . \n',1

'there\'s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . \nstiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? \nhe\'s in \" there\'s something about mary , \" which i * still * haven\'t seen . \nand he\'s in the acerbic \" your friends & neighbors , \" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . \nnow there\'s \" permanent midnight , \" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . \nthere\'s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they\'ve proved themselves commercially . \newan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in \" emma \" and \" brassed off , \" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle\'s transatlantic junk-fest , \" trainspotting . \" \nthe philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want \'em to be taken seriously , make \'em do drugs . \n \" permanent midnight \" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . \na habit , in stahl\'s own words , \" the size of utah . \" \nas stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . \nunlike \" trainspotting , \" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , \" permanent midnight \" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . \none of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to \" naked lunch \" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , \" so i can shave . \" \nstahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in \" permanent midnight \" ; it\'s so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . \nwhile the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl\'s autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . \n \" permanent midnight \" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author\'s words-- \" escape the drug scene \" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you\'d swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . \nstahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown\'s own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . \njaneane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that\'s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . \nstiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . \nthe ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see \" permanent midnight \" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living . \n',1
'billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996\'s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . \nas jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton\'s hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . \nthree men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . \njacob and lou want to pocket the cash . \nhank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . \neventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . \nthings start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . \ndisaster is sure to strike . \ndirector sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . \nwhile there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . \nscott b . smith\'s screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven\'t read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . \nwhile it does remind one of danny boyle\'s shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . \nalar kivilo\'s cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen\'s fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . \ndanny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . \nif there\'s a flaw in the film , it\'s that it goes on for just a little too long . \njust when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . \nwhile this isn\'t really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . \nthe performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank\'s scheming wife . \nthis is an excellent showcase for thornton\'s fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . \nfingers crossed , though , that this doesn\'t stop him from making another evil dead sequel . \n',1
'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\'s fascist regime . \namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\'t like federico fellini\'s work very much . \nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \nfellini\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\' visions . \nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\'t care that much about politics . \nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \nfellini couldn\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \nvignettes aren\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\'s fantasies . \nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\'s long-time associate nino rota . \nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \n',1
'devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven\'s starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein\'s novel than it is a literary satire . \nthe author\'s jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . \nand i suppose that\'s exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . \nheinlein\'s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . \noutlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it\'s basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . \nsometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) . \namong those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick \" doogie howser \" harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets . \nwhile carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from \" beverly hills 90210 . \" \nso if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? \nfor one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . \nthe very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . \nif starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . \nit\'s a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it\'s a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it\'s worth . \nthe no-name cast also plays into verhoeven\'s treatment of heinlein\'s most controversial conceit . \nin this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most . \nverhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era \" why we fight \" series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches . \nthese characters really are just \" fresh meat for the grinder , \" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . \nit\'s not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . \nin fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends ) . \nverhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he\'s making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . \nif that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it\'s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . \nthere may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody\'s business . \nverhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . \nit is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn\'t perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . \ni wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn\'t work out that way . \nthat would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . \n',1
'moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you\'ve got to know how to allocate your resources . \nevery dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . \nin the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . \nin the movies , you end up with films like \" spawn \" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . \njackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . \nhe spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . \nwatching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn\'t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . \nbut like the lions star , jackie doesn\'t have anybody to block for him . \nalmost every cent that\'s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . \nthis leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . \nthis also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . \n ( chan\'s first release in this country , \" rumble in the bronx \" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) \nheck , jackie doesn\'t even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . \nin condor , chan plays the same character he\'s always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . \njackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . \nhe is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , \" jackie , save us ! \" , and misuse firearms . \nthe villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he\'s more pathetic than evil . \nen route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . \nonce at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film\'s centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that\'s even better than the one in face/off . \nthis is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . \nignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain\'s legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn\'t he take the key with him ? ) . \ndon\'t worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . \njust go see the movie . \noperation condor has pretentions of being a \" raiders of the lost ark \" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . \nhowever , you\'ve got to go with what you\'ve got , and what you\'ve got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . \n',1
'well i\'ll be damned , what a most excellent surprise . \nnot to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950\'s drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 . \nonce again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer . \nthe rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns . \nit seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it\'s an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent . \nthe plot in brief . \npaul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons . \nhis race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans . \nhe visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf . \nhe also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires . \nbut before long , amanda and johnson\'s sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric . \ni must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging . \nbritish actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) . \nbut his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding . \nthe weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character . \nyork is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic . \nthis is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i\'ve seen from him . \nand while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths . \nthe casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original . \nthe balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 . \nthe film doesn\'t drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless . \nand it doesn\'t matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock . \nin fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end . \ntighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation . \nbut these are minor complaints . \njust see it . \nnot of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years . \nand michael york : in one cool swoop you\'ve made yourself a b-movie legend , dude . \n',1
'the small-scale film , in limited release , \" waking ned devine \" is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town . \nfilled with breathtaking scenery , \'characters\' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot . \nthe story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review . \nthe film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny . \nwhat gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore . \nwho that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) . \npart detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds . \nthe village consists of several amusing characters . \na clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch . \nthere\'s also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up . \nthere are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] . \npacing is right . \ntowards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that\'s okay because for most of the 90 minutes we\'ve been interested in the goings on . \na mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged . \nin one brief dream sequence - you\'ll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists . \none of the key moments in the film . \nthe music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering . \na fine film that\'s for everybody except action fans . \nsomewhat like \'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , \' . . . \nbut livelier . \n',1
'i\'ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club . \na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i\'m watching a 40-year-old class clown . \nin his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . \nmrs . \ndoubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams\' best comic screen project yet . \nwhile it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . \ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . \nwilliams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . \none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . \nunemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda\'s ad for an afternoon housekeeper . \nhe turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . \ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda\'s flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . \nmrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . \nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that\'s instantly believable . \nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman\'s dorothy michaels look like milton berle . \nmore problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it\'s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn\'t recognize any of the voices as her husband\'s . \nperhaps the biggest contrivance we\'re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . \nthere\'s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . \nfortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . \nduring the film , i was generally too busy laughing . \nafter getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams\' riffing , mrs . \ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . \ndaniel\'s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . \nclearly , most of the credit for doubtfire\'s success goes to robin williams . \nit took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn\'t just robin williams with a different name . \nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . \nwisely , he never aims for saintly . \nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . \nit\'s one of mrs . \ndoubtfire\'s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . \nas miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . \nthe children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . \nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . \nit\'s easy to see mrs . \ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it\'s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . \nbut mrs . \ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge\'s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda\'s relationship . \nthere\'s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . \ndoubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . \nand it\'s nice to see robin williams just act for a change . \n',1

'it\'s hard not to recommend \" the others . \" \nthe supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( \" open your eyes \" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . \nthe cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . \nbut the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . \noverall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old \" twilight zone \" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child\'s toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . \nwatching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , \" get on with it ! \" \nas much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in \" the others , \" my reaction was much the same . \nset at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman . \nanne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . \nat the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family . \nthe two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . \nto make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . \ngrace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . \nthat\'s essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . \nearlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . \nthe visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . \ni also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . \ngrace is a christian and answers her children\'s questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . \nwhen mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do . \nbut those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending . \n \" the others \" sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist . \n',1
'in \" the sweet hereafter , \" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . \nhe shows us how it isn\'t dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . \non a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . \nfourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . \nfor the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . \nthey have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . \nalberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . \nthe bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . \nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . \nhowever , according to stephens , there are no \" accidents \" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . \nhe goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . \nand , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . \nhowever , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . \nhe is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . \nhe has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . \nhis daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . \nshe calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \n \" i don\'t know who i\'m taking to , \" he tells her . \nin his mind , his daughter is dead . \nthe lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town\'s pain , but also his own . \nhowever , not everyone in town wants it to happen . \nbilly ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . \nhe has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . \nhe doesn\'t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . \nto him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn\'t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . \ncentral to \" the sweet hereafter \" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into \" a wheelchair girl , \" as she puts it . \naside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . \nit is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning\'s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town\'s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . \nobviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town\'s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . \nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . \nthere is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . \nof all the storylines in \" the sweet hereafter , \" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . \negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn\'t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . \nwhat egoyan has done in \" the sweet hereafter \" is really nothing short of miraculous . \nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . \negoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \n \" the sweet hereafter \" is quite the opposite ; egoyan\'s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \n \" the sweet hereafter \" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . \nthe film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . \nthe beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . \nlike his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . \nhe works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . \nthe actual bus wreck itself doesn\'t happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . \nbecause human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . \ncertainly one of the best films of 1997 , \" the sweet hereafter \" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film . \n',1
'usually a movie is about something more than a soiled rug , but not the big lebowski . \nthe new offering from the creators of 1996\'s critical hit fargo , is to say the least , wildly entertaining . \noriginality has always been a strong trait in the coen brother\'s movies , and the big lebowski is insanely original . \nit begins oddly enough when jeff \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) is mistaken for a millionaire , jeff \" the big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) , who\'s wife , bunny ( tara reid ) owes money all over town . \ntwo goons , out to collect on bunny\'s debt break into dude\'s house . \nthey attempt to collect the money that bunny owes them and one of them urinates on his rug . \nthe next day dude explains his situation to his bowling team ( steve buscemi & john goodman , respectively . ) \nhe is advised to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defiled rug . \nhe does this , and shortly after gets tied up in a kidnapping caper . \nthis is a extremely funny movie with lots of belly laugh moments . \nthe coen brothers have assembled a great cast that play off each other perfectly . \nalso several great supporting roles , john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus . \nthe coen\'s script plays off perfectly and it all goes together to make it extremely entertaining . \ni doubt this movie will be nearly as popular as fargo , but its off the wall moments make it so far the best of 1998 . \nif you like anything else the coen brothers have done you will love this one , if not they give this one a try its a little different . \n',1
'jacques tati\'s 1953 classic \" les vacances de m . hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot\'s vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . \nthe characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week\'s vacation . \nyet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . \npart of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . \nslapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don\'t watch where they\'re going . \nin \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \nin one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \nwhile crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \nwhen he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \ntati doesn\'t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \nit has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience\'s expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \ntati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \nwhen hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \ntati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he\'s not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . \nfor example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot\'s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel\'s lights coming on one by one . \nthen this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \nthe ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \nas much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \nthe other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \nit easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \ninstead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \n \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \nanyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \nnote : \" les vacances de m . hulot \" was not rated by the mpaa . \nit would at most receive a pg rating . \n',1
'plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . \nhe is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . \noh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? \nkewl ! \ncritique : despite this film not looking like a \" tim burton movie \" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . \nalthough the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . \ni mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! \ni also have to \" give it up \" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . \ni especially enjoyed bonham carter\'s performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth\'s bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . \nplot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . \ni was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of \" human beings as animals \" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . \ni also hated the \" kid \" character who just got on my nerves and didn\'t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won\'t ruin it here but c\'mon guys . . . you \ncoulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . \nbut the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . \nthis dude didn\'t seem to give a rat\'s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn\'t really care about what happened to him either . \nnow i\'m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . \nvisually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . \nthe \" surprise ending \" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn\'t really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . \nso overall , i loved the whole \" feel \" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn\'t appreciate the film\'s lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . \nbut i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . \nps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn\'t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he\'s suddenly been thrust ( \" this is a mad house ! \" - \ntype of thing ) . \nthe guy in this film barely seems to be \" put off \" by the fact that he\'s surrounded by apes who can speak english ! ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \nthe arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) \n',1
'i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i\'m watching a movie . \ni don\'t even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching \" the x-files \" every sunday night . \nit\'s the only show that\'s worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don\'t watch reruns , i\'m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . \ni am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . \nand i love gillian anderson . \nthe x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . \nthe film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . \nthis is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . \ni expected to like it more than any episode i\'ve seen , and my expectations were met . \nactually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . \nwhen the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . \nthe film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . \nbut wait , i\'m getting ahead of myself . \nthe film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . \nthe alien\'s blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . \nit turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . \nsoon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . \nas i\'ve written before , it\'s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . \nfans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . \ndirector rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . \nthere are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they\'re in the alien spacecraft , you\'ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . \nthe special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . \nwhat i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . \nour heroes are given subtle introductions ( we\'re not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn\'t required to understand the film . \nthere are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i\'ll keep those as surprises . \nit takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . \nthe series is strong for a lot of reasons . \nit\'s original ( though it has many ties to \" the twilight zone \" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . \nwhat really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . \nduchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . \nhe has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . \nanderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she\'s also a strong actress . \nboth performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they\'ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . \ni enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . \n1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . \nit\'s an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . \nthe x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . \nit\'s nice to see a risk pay off for a change . \nactually , it\'s nice to see a risk at all . \n',1
'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\'s notice . \nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \nwhat if he\'s also able to think on his feet ? \nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\'s the negotiator . \nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\'s office . \ni don\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \nalthough it wouldn\'t surprise me if he did . \nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \nalthough roman\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \nhow can we believe he\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\'s acting ability . \nalmost every time he\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \nhis is an interesting character . \nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \ngray really lucked out with this cast . \ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \nfortunately , this doesn\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\'s reality . \nwe\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \nas an audience , we\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \n',1
'we all know the fate of \" child\'s play , \" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . \nwith the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be \" bride of chucky \" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it\'s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . \nalas , the original \" child\'s play \" actually isn\'t that bad . \neven seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn\'t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don\'t believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn\'t a bad movie . \nit\'s not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don\'t have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , \" i know what you did last summer \" has recently gone . \nthe premise of \" child\'s play \" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid\'s doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid\'s doll i\'ve ever seen . \nthe next day , a bum who\'s stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . \nof course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . \nlike the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . \nand soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn\'t just a kiddie doll one by one . \nthe idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . \nit plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they\'re crazy . \nit plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . \neven if there\'s an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , \nthere\'s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . \nthe ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . \nif there\'s one horrible thing about many horror films , it\'s that the protagonists are morons who you can\'t help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , \" child\'s play \" steers away from that . \nand most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! \nthat doll\'s moving on its own ! ) , but because he\'s a generally scary character . \nif there\'s anything really wrong with \" child\'s play , \" it\'s that it\'s too trite and has too less self esteem . \nat almost 90 minutes , \" child\'s play \" features way too less to be a real classic of horror . \nit throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren\'t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . \nif the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which \nisn\'t necessarily a bad thing . \nas such , \" child\'s play \" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film . \n',1
'the \" submarine \" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is . \nthink about it . . . \nthese films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public . \nthey aren\'t like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those . \nand they aren\'t like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one\'s done any of that stuff yet . \nwhen a new one comes out , you don\'t hear anyone say \" ugh , another submarine movie \" like people tend to say \" ugh , another boxing movie \" . \nlook at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . . \nall are well regarded as top-notch entertainment . \ngladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii . \nwe learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) . \nmcconaughey\'s crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence . \nthe mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters . \nthe first great thing about u-571 is the film\'s opening sequence . \nthe german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion . \nit\'s tense , exciting and fascinating . \nand i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles . \nmost movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away . \nonce the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder \" ok , now how do they get out of this ? \" . \nthe stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it\'s a lot of fun getting there . \ni only have two minor complaints about the entire film . \nthe first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . \nwhile their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . \ni mean , did we really have to see the ship\'s crew at a wedding ? \nbecause of that , you now know exactly what\'s going to happen to the groom ! \nmy other gripe would be during the film\'s finale . \nthere\'s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president\'s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . \ni cannot stress this enough . . . \nuntil a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . \nyes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you \" that couldn\'t happen \" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . \nit succeeds fantastically . \n[pg-13] \n',1
'eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . \nknown for his notorious late 80\'s slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . \nwith the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . \nlife was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it\'s a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . \ndirector ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn\'t insert a distracting plot to back them up . \nlife is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . \namazingly , the scale never tips in either\'s favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . \nas the movie opens , we\'re introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . \nthere he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . \nsomehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . \nwhen all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . \nhence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . \nthe film takes us from the 30\'s all the way to the 90\'s , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . \nluckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . \nnot only do we believe the characters look as if they\'re 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . \nmurphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . \nthis is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it\'s sleeve . \nwhile the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it\'s core . \nbut the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . \nthe movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it\'s an overwhelming delight . \ni could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don\'t want to . \nit\'s such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . \n',1
'as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \nthe shot has tibbs\' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \npreceding the very original \" a soldier\'s story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger\'s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \njewison\'s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960\'s . \nit displays this perfectly . \nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , \" in the heat of the night \" and the even better \" in cold blood . \" ) \n',1
' \" say , any of you know how to madison ? \" \n--- brad \" asshole \" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . \nthe story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . \nin the early 70\'s , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o\'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . \nthe result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . \nthe play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . \nthe film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . \nand immediately tanked at the box office . \nwhether it was because fox wasn\'t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn\'t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . \nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . \na year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . \nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . \nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . \nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show\'s life as the ultimate cult film was born . \nfor the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . \nbrad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . \nthey plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . \nremembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . \nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . \nfrank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . \nas rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter\'s mad schemes . \nlittle do any of them know that the doctor\'s handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o\'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . \ngoing back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . \nif i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don\'t think i would have known what to make of it either . \nfor all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . \nby the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o\'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . \nwhen i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . \nit goes without saying that the \" time warp \" is the most popular song in the film . \neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . \nwhat those who haven\'t seen the movie don\'t know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . \nmy personal favorite is \" over at the frankenstein place \" , but \" dammit janet \" is also maddeningly catchy . \ntim curry\'s vocals on the rocking tune \" sweet transvestite \" need to be heard to be believed . \nthe finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . \nfrightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( \" rose tint my world \" , \" don\'t dream it \" , \" wild and untamed thing \" , and \" i\'m going home \" ) , all of which are immensely singable . \nthe film\'s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . \ndespite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn\'t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . \nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don\'t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . \nnote : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . \nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . \no\'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . \n25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . \nas a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . \nif you are one of those people who can\'t get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . \nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it\'ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . \nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . \nthe film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called \" superheroes \" . \nfor ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . \noriginally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . \nmost reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . \nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o\'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . \nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . \nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . \nthe first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . \nthe second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . \nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . \nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . \nwhen selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . \nonce the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . \nthe first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . \nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don\'t know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don\'t know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff\'s story lab . \nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . \nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . \nformer lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the \" behind the music : rocky horror \" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung \" hot patootie \" . \nthe \" behind the music \" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o\'brien\'s jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . \nthere are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o\'brien , and meat loaf interviews . \nas far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . \none of which is just the \" superheroes \" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called \" once in a while \" . \na series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick\'s pants ) . \nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . \nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is \" a different sort of jaws \" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for \" toucha toucha touch me \" and \" sweet transvestite \" ) . \nfox\'s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( \" you\'re lucky . . . \ni\'m lucky . . . \nhe\'s lucky . . . \nwe\'re all lucky ! \" ) . \nit\'s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . \nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . \ni raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition . \n[r] \n',1
'those print and television ads trumpeting that \" \'grease\' is still the word \" are right on the money . \nto celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like \" star wars \" -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease . \nthat\'s fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? \nor the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to \" be an athletic supporter \" by rooting for the home team ? \nor national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- \" empty nest \" dinah manhoff ) ? \nand these are all probably considered minor moments . . . \na very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom\'s most effervescently charming . \nfor those eight of you who aren\'t familiar with the story , here\'s a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . \nsandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny\'s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . \nso sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . \nthe drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of \" greased lightening , \" the film\'s big \" guy \" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but \" grease \" \'s flaws amount too few to carp . \nthe movie\'s first showpiece is \" summer nights , \" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance . \nnot only is \" nights \" tremendously catchy , but it\'s also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . \nthere has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of \" you\'re the one that i want \" and \" we go together , \" \" grease \" \'s euphoric cappers . \nall this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated \" hopelessly devoted to you \" is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing\'s lamenting ballad \" there are worse things i could do \" is one of \" grease \" \'s most unjustly overlooked tunes . \nthe soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of \" nights \" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . \nand it\'s a testament to \" grease \" \'s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it\'s the same all-around blast it\'s always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . \nto \'90s viewers , \" grease \" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts . \nbut regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , \" grease \" is still the word . \n',1
'the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard\'s materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute . \nindeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products . \nincluding this year\'s upcoming a midsummer night\'s dream , shakespeare\'s material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen productions since 1990 . \nbut for a change of pace , mrs . \nbrown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love . \nmarc norman and tom stoppard\'s story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously . \n ( will shakespeare of the 1590\'s would\'ve been married to anne hathaway , and he would\'ve had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . ) will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- \" romeo and ethel , the pirate\'s daughter \" -- just doesn\'t quite seem right . \nwith the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , \" romeo and juliet . \" \nthe love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect . \nfiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy . \nthe supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will\'s worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman . \neven ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance . \nthe story is well-crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the \" let\'s make a movie \" -genre . \nthe dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience\'s lowest common denominator . \nthere\'s something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material . \nalthough certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998\'s pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around . \ncertainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year\'s-open releases is just around the corner . \n',1
'with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \nthe parallels don\'t end there , either . \natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king\'s dreamcatcher . \neven the film\'s content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \nin fact , it\'s the perfect blend of the feel-good \'60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \nking\'s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film\'s title comes from the second chapter ) . \nit\'s set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould\'s secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby\'s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \ni won\'t go into what these powers are , but they\'re considerably toned down from the book ( and don\'t involve black stuff flying out of ted\'s mouth , a la mile ) . \natlantis\' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel\'s final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks\' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski\'s red . \nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \nwhile i didn\'t really have much of a problem with goldman\'s screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \ngoldman , for those of you who don\'t read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else\'s films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he\'s penned ( like the general\'s daughter ) . \nit\'s mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \nand robert blake ) . \nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \nwell , he\'s not , and it doesn\'t make sense . \n1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements \n',1
' \" no man is an island , \" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie\'s themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer\'s ambitious adaptation of king\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\'s theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \" student \" , among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\'s excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\'s tics and todd\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan\'s and renfro\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\'s finely-tuned realization , i\'d like to single out renfro\'s daring work . \nhe isn\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\'t do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october , 1998 \n * the excellent collection king\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n',1
'james cmaeron\'s breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . \nfor those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . \nhuman survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . \nhowever , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . \nto stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor\'s mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . \nin response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . \nimages of machines and of humans\' reliance on machines dominate the film . \neven though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . \nin the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . \nin the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . \ncameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he\'s not happy about it . \nunabated technological growth brings about the terminator\'s other obsession : the apocalypse . \nwe have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . \nchildren watch the flames in a burning television . \nwhen the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . \neven though the \" future is not set , \" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . \nall sara can do is await it . \n ( cameron doesn\'t wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) \nthe end of the world is the human race\'s own fault , too . \nafter all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . \nback in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron\'s ) . \nthese days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . \ntrue , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield\'s and lance henriksen\'s detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . \ncameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . \nfrom a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . \narnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . \nwe are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger\'s later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . \ncameron and hurd\'s script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . \nwhile we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese\'s intentions . \ncameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . \neither the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . \nthe violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom\'s heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator\'s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . \nfor a low budget film , the terminator\'s special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . \nspecial mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . \nit is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . \none thing that doesn\'t hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton\'s hairdo . \n',1

'[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh\'s hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap . \nas it happens , it didn\'t take long . ] \nis there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? \nknown mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968\'s romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria . \nlast year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature . \nit might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen . \nat first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance . \nthe hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused . \nthe ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery . \nthe plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus . \nit is zeffirelli\'s genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace . \nin this italian master\'s hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son\'s worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea . \nafter all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? \nwhat seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead . \nwho could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a \" lethal weapon \" ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? \nfranco zeffirelli , that\'s who . \nand it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money . \nwhat gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible . \nhis line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed . \nhis movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character . \nthis is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film\'s end . \nglenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet\'s mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i\'m still trying to understand the character as written . \n ( zeffirelli\'s incestuous interpretation of hamlet\'s relationship with his mother doesn\'t help . ) \nalan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy . \nby and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably . \nof special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone . \nboth support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare \" this is important ; this is shakespeare ! \" \ni particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due . \nperhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare \" definitive . \" \nand there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen . \nbut if you\'ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start . \n',1
'upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits , i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be \" hellraiser meets the crow \" . \nbut as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing \" the strangers \" and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked . \nthere was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice . \ni knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character . \nsutherland played the role as a true veteran . \nupon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography . \ni would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most . \nthe film flowed beautifully . \nas i was being taken through the intricate regions of the \" dark city \" , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in \" the usual suspects \" . \nnot to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy . \nbut if you\'re not exactly the biggest sci-fi fan , caveat emptor . \nget ready for the atmostpheric darkness of \" 12 monkeys \" or \" the crow \" without the boredom or depression . \nthe concept of the plot is as mindstretching as \" 12 monkeys \" was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated . \nand imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic-book-gone-feature-film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of . \ndark city simply puts \" spawn \" to shame . \nin fact , during the climax of the film i couldn\'t help but feel the strong presence of an \" akira \" -esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie . \nso my initial predictions were wrong . \nthis film is anything but the meloncholy of \" hellraiser \" parts one through five . \ni\'m never one to base a film entirly on special effects , so know that when i give dark city \nit\'s actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even ( tsk , tsk ) special effects . \nnot since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away . \nthe best film i\'ve seen all year , and easily one of the best i\'ve ever seen \n',1

'vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks . \nit is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about . \nbased on anne rice\'s novel , \" interview with a vampire \" is a long , dark trip to hell . \nthe film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco . \nthe camera slowly find particular window . \na shape of a young man is visible in the darkness . \n \" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? \" . \nthe mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater ) . \nhis tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise ) . \ngiven a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret . \neverlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace . \nlouis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough . \neventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis . \nfor a while , they are one \" big , happy family . \" \nbut all things end , and claudia\'s growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation . \nwhen luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned . \ndirector neil jordan ( \" the crying game \" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere . \nas the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun . \nwhen luis is \" born to darkness \" , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight . \nthe beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film . \nfrom the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days . \nthe casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain . \nthe controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective . \ncruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty . \ncruise\'s lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance . \nwith alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear . \n \" . . . kill them mercifully , but do it . \nyou are what you are . . for \ndo not doubt , you are a killer ! \" \nthat is how lestat is teaching luis . \nbut behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages . \nbrad pitt is equally convincing as the \" vampire with a human soul \" . \nantonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible . \nthe greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character . \nthe world is changing around the little child , but she does not . \nshe remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity . \nonly her wise , dark eyes reveal her age . \nironically the film\'s only miss is the script . \nanne rice\'s novel is a very interesting read , and her script is rich , colorful and emotional , but it is also tiering and too melancholic , at times resembling a soap opera : \nclaudia : \" . . . . is that what i should do ? \nlet you go . . my \nfather , my luis , who made me . . . who will look after me , my dark angel , when you are gone ? \" \nluis : \" everything will be alright . . \" \nclaudia : \" do you really believe that ?

'if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? \n \" gattaca \" is a film which presents a future where society has answered \" yes \" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . \n \" gattaca \" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . \nthe way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future \" gattaca \" presents becomes true . \ncontrary to the misleading trailers , \" gattaca \" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there\'s lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . \nthis is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . \nin fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who\'s novel \" brave new world \" featured genetically engineered children ) . \nit\'s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what \" gattaca \" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . \nthe story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90\% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . \nas a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . \nvincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it\'s as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . \nbut one day , he finds out that it\'s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( \" wings \" \' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in \'97 : \" men in black , \" \" a life less ordinary \" . . . ) , who\'s client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . \nfortunately , though , there\'s no record of the accident , and he\'s willing to give someone else his life . \nsince vincent looks a bit like him . . . \nafter a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . \nthere , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who\'s genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man\'s stats are . \nhowever , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome\'s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent\'s long lost brother , anton , who hasn\'t seen him since they were teenagers . \nwe know vincent/jerome didn\'t do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome\'s in trouble , but also the real jerome , who\'s as much in it as he is . \nhowever , there isn\'t many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it\'s message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . \nthe suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . \nwhile there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . \nwhat is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . \nirene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . \nand the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . \nwhat jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it\'s a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn\'t have the down ending of other works of this kind . \nthe production design of this film is probably the best i\'ve seen this year : it\'s stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . \nsince genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . \nand the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life . \nthe ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . \nthe acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . \nbut the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he\'s in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . \ni think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i\'m not sure of . \n \" gattaca \" warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we\'ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . \nand when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out . \n',1
'one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . \nthat concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . \nhowever , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells\' novel the time machine , wasn\'t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . \nthe author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . \nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . \ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . \nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . \nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . \nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . \nat the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . \nthey are skeptical , but that doesn\'t prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . \nat first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . \nfinally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . \nwhen he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . \nbut , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . \nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . \nfor h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . \neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . \ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . \nof course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . \nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . \nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . \nbut , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . \nthe acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george\'s trusted friend filby . \nyvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . \nhowever , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . \n',1
'for a movie about disco-era excess , \" 54 \" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club . \nthink of it as a sort of \" boogie nights \" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , \" 54 \" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination . \nit never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either . \nin fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , \" 54 \" would be about as feathery as the time period\'s popular female hairstyle . \nstudio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 . \ninside , anything went and , we are told , everything did . \nthe film\'s fictional main character is shane o\'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club\'s velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines . \nhis wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in \'79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course . \nonce inside , shane becomes seduced by the club\'s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs . \nhe has such a good time that he doesn\'t want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy . \nhe quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg\'s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own . \nafter rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 . \nbut fame doesn\'t come without a price . \n \" 54 \" \'s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act . \nalleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since \" 54 \" sometimes feels like it\'s missing a scene here or there . \nnowhere is this more apparent than in shane\'s relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he\'s long admired from afar . \nthe romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special . \nthat \" 54 \" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it\'s assembled . \nsure , it\'s shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we\'ve seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision . \nthe film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( \" the wedding singer \" \'s ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54\'s closed doors and asks for a \" funky little treat . \" \nthe solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you\'re caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot . \nnewcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it\'s a shame their subplot goes nowhere . \nmeyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in \" clueless \" ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , \" one , two , three , attitude ! \" \nsherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big \'70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left \" er \" as rubell\'s accountant , but she\'s criminally underused . \nas the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone . \nwhen he\'s not playing the life of the party , the ex- \" saturday night live \" comedian strips away all of rubell\'s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it\'s a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees . \nand while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate \" austin powers \" -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with \" 54 \" \'s overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball . \n',1
'tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever . \nnot surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million . \nthat\'s a shocking 100 times profit ! \nrumours have it that a smart internet `marketing\' ploy was so successful in gaining cult-like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box-office , raking in millions on its opening weekend . \nshot in 16mm and video ( i suspect . ) , the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch . \naudiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning . \nthis is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences . \ntbwp is simply smart . \nfilmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film-making . \nsimply amazing in that respect , i must say . \ntalk about impact , oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing . \ni did , especially the last bit but i\'m not revealing more . \nyou have to see it for yourself . \ni can\'t help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become . \ncould it be that finally , an indie-film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ? \nor was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ? \nwell , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film . \nno gore , no special effects , i just can\'t get over how terribly smart this film is ! \n',1
'sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . \nit\'s not the time or the distance , it\'s the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . \nyet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . \nthe wings of the dove fits the pattern . \nkate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . \nmerton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . \nbut kate\'s \" job \" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . \nher father lost all of her family\'s money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . \nnaturally , a newspaper writer\'s wages don\'t count as \" rich . \" \nkate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he\'s not marriageable . \nkate\'s american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . \nat a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees . \nkate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her . \nit appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup . \nmerton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it . \nhe is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute . \nthe three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated . \nlet\'s sum up : millie has fallen for merton . \nmerton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate . \nkate loves him but can\'t marry him , so on the one hand she\'s trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she\'s jealous of them as a couple . \na clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact . \nat this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies . \nmillie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate . \nshe lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees . \nkate leaves venice so that the two m\'s can be alone together . \nmerton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her . \nhe\'s not sure he can separate the two . \nkate finds that she\'s not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else . \nthe brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved . \nwithout revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly . \nthe title refers to the object of merton\'s vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament . \none is left with feelings of regret and despair . \nwhat started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy . \nan interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . \na couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . \ntheir involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . \ni wouldn\'t call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . \nas i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . \nroache successfully conveyed his character\'s ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he\'s thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie . \nmillie\'s part didn\'t require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . \ni will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . \ntheir settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially . \nstill , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over . \n',1
'no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan . \ni\'m referring , specifically , to the narrative form . \nin the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . \nsaid story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner . \nwhen the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning . \nthroughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like \" the pied piper \" ( passages of which are read during the film ) . \nbut there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify . \nwe finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect . \na horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture . \nthe fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident . \ni have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan\'s heavy- handedness behind the camera . \nfor the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . \nbut that\'s just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much . \nalso , a subplot involving incest rings untrue . \nperhaps it wouldn\'t feel so contrived if it weren\'t shot in such a tasteful manner . \nthere are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . \ni was half-right . \nnevertheless it\'s worth-seeing . \nthe delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that \" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , \" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed . \nthe sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it\'s not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) . \negoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times . \nthough i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter . \n',1
'the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \nwhy ? \nit\'s torturous , it\'s maniacal , and it\'s just plain fun . \nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn\'t torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \nthe catch is , these movies aren\'t the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike\'s will to live . \ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \nin this case , it\'s the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i\'ll explain this one . \nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it\'s a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \nmst3k , which doesn\'t actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it\'s better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don\'t know what you\'re in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year\'s at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec\'s have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \n',1
'the computer-animated comedy \" shrek \" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it\'s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , \" shrek \" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children\'s story , \" shrek \" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the \" awk \" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre\'s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from \" snow white \" has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of \" the dating game \" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , \" even though she lives with seven men , she\'s not easy ! \" ) \nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from \" babe \" ( \" that\'ll do , donkey . \nthat\'ll do \" ) to \" the graduate . \" \nbut the lion\'s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a \" possessed toy \" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , \" get that dead broad off the table ! \" \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad\'s royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like \" it\'s a small world . \" \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other\'s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere\'s a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere\'s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can\'t play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , \" shrek \" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit\'s a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad\'s diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ?

'`we run tings . \ntings don\'t run we . \' \n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn\'t as hyperkinetic as most of woo\'s films are . \nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon\' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \nthe end credit song , `we run tings\' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta\' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn\'t contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i\'d say he has a pretty good track record . \noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \nif action films are your thing and you don\'t mind intermittent subtitles , then you can\'t go wrong with this film . \nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \ni\'m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop\'s honors are well deserved . \n',1
'a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold \'yawn\' . \nfollowed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer . \nthen i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see . \nwell , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here . \n\'here\' , of course , was still three months away . \ni\'ll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow . \ni\'d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list . \nthat , let me tell you , has changed completely . \ni knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet . \nthe acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick . \nseriously . \ni\'ve never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry , \nmake that \'roles\' in the movie . \neven travolta\'s great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage\'s character portrayals . \nmy favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler\'s hideout . \nhalf drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son\'s death from castor\'s perspective - \" doesn\'t it just break your heart . \" he mutters coldly . \nnow don\'t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it\'s not . \nthat\'s what really makes this movie unique . \nit\'s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all . \nsuspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that\'s \nthe only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and \nnever hit . \nseveral action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press \'rewind\' and watch it over again . \nthe part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant . \nwhilst cage\'s and travolta\'s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing . \njoan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer\'s long suffering wife . \ni like the fact that her character didn\'t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it \nwould have wrecked her potrayal . \ngina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy\'s mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy\'s mistreated girlfriends . \nother movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a \nsex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent . \ndominique swain , who plays archer\'s daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen\'s or gershon\'s . \nfaults ? well . . . there were some i have to say . \nfirst , the movie\'s ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it\'s own good . \nafter the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can\'t help but think - \" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? \" . \nthere were certain bits that weren\'t handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice . \noverall , this movie was not perfect . \nbut i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect . \nmany critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i \ncertainly hope so . \n',1
'titantic , writer and director james cameron\'s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? \nas a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . \nif you\'ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . \nthe movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world\'s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . \nin either case , it is filmmaking at its best . \nwhen we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . \nhe said no but that the time would go by so fast she\'d never notice the length . \namazingly , he was right . \ntitanic is one of the few long films that doesn\'t suffer because of it . \nthe lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . \nfortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world\'s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as \" the ship of dreams . \" \nthe necklace\'s hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . \nalthough almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . \nusing a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . \nafter twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . \nin a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . \nthe strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . \nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal\'s supercilious put-downs . \nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what\'s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship\'s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \npeter lamont\'s sets are more than authentic . \none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \nit then shifts to the ship\'s massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \nwhat a lark . \nwe\'ve struck an iceberg . \nnow let\'s get back to our brandy and cigars . \nthe ship\'s musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \n \" it\'s good-bye for a little while , \" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \n \" this boat\'s for mommies and children . \nthere\'ll be a boat in a little while for daddies . \" \nbasically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . \nperhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim\'s on-board the ship . \nin the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . \n \" no thanks , \" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \n \" we\'re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . \nbut we would like a brandy . \" \ntitanic runs 3 : 14 . \nit is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up . \n',1
'every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . \nnow i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . \nso i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . \nsee it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . \nsee the best film i have seen in 1996 . \nnot the best children\'s film . . . the \nbest film . \nperiod . \nbased on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict . \nthe wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . \nwhen they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . \nbut things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . \nmatilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull\'s cruelty . \nit was this spring\'s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . \nand just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . \ndevito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . \nin one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . \nmatilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . \nit is also characteristic of the best children\'s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don\'t realize that they are learning them . \nthere is a hilarious moment when matilda\'s television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . \nmatilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because \" i\'m big and you\'re little , i\'m right and you\'re wrong . \" \nmore specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people\'s notions of how she should behave . \nit is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . \nfinally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . \ndevito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . \nthe child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . \nbut there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda\'s classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda\'s father . \ni can\'t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . \nmatilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . \ni will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . \nand now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . \n',1
'nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) \na film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson \nthis extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker\'s \" dracula \" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . \ninspired by f . w . murnau\'s 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog\'s film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . \nthe original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . \nuntil now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . \nboth of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . \napparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . \nthe german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . \neveryone knows the story of dracula . \nor do they ? \nhis story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won\'t hurt . \njonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker\'s hometown . \nupon seeing a photo of harker\'s wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . \nlocking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . \nupon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . \nthat is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker\'s tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . \nnosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . \nthe film\'s surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising . \nthere is much to enjoy , but i\'ll limit my praise to a few key points . \nholding the film together is kinski\'s remarkable performance as count dracula . \npast screen portrayals , including bela lugosi\'s famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . \nbut kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling . \naided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula\'s vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease . \nthis man is dreadfully lonely . \nhe lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . \nkinski\'s portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . \nwhen he dies , you almost feel as if this man\'s tortured soul has been freed at last . \nthen there\'s the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . \nit is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it\'s quite impossible to imagine the film without it . \npopul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . \nwhen i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . \nthe one i still listen to the most is \" tantric songs \" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . \nit\'s a testament to the music\'s depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them . \nthe album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . \nthis is a timely re-release by anchor bay . \nafter francis ford coppola\'s unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker\'s tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog\'s film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story . \nto some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . \nwithout a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre . \ndon\'t miss it . \n',1
'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\'s schindler\'s list shows . \nmost of today\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \nthat\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \nit\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \nthe mine , which is run by homer\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\'s doing here . \nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\'s charm . \nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\'s mother and father . \nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \nher role is instantly likeable . \nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \nhe\'s definitely a driving force in homer\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \nalthough it doesn\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \nit\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \n',1
'near the end of frank capra\'s holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down . \nhe has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls . \nstanding upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide . \nhe has potential he hasn\'t fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others . \nas a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls . \nbut times and ambitions change . \nthings happen , and he\'s stuck . \nhis guardian angel is there , and shows him that . . . it\'s \na wonderful life . \nin a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him . \nhe learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift . \nhis earthly problems are solved . \nthe climatic scene is a marvel . \nfrank capra\'s film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation . \nwonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released . \nmany films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly . \nbut this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices . \nthe only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george\'s guardian angel . \nthey aren\'t all that bad , but they remain corny and a little out of place . \nnevertheless , this is one film that deserves its place in time , cinema history , and our hearts . \nit can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age . \nhere is one genuine masterpeice , a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection . \nthis crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny , exciting , moving and uplifting . \nthe film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey -- there isn\'t too much to it , but capra and the gang ( various screenwriters , composers , actors ) plumet the material to its fullest potential . \nthe result is a film -- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film -- that will always be remembered , celebrated , and loved . \n',1
'for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow . \nfirstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship . \nsecondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes . \nthirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose . \nfinally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent\'s blessing . \nof these four , the last one can be a nightmare . \nmeeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression . \nif you\'re lucky , things will go smoothly . \nbut , if you\'re greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong . \nand with a name like that , how could it not ? \nwhen greg first meets his fianc ? e\'s father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive . \nwhen he tells jack that he\'s a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , \" not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? \" \nit\'s definitely not a good start . \nbut greg is determined to win him over , and it\'s this desire that fuels the movie . \nhe first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner . \nit doesn\'t matter that he\'s jewish . \nif daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that\'s what he\'s going to gamely do . \n \" oh god . . . you\'re \nsuch a good god \" , he moons . \nhis discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the \" deniro squint \" ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it\'s pretty hard not to grin . \nthings get progressively worse for greg . \nand that\'s too bad because he\'s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart . \neventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people . \nit\'s a never-ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes . \nhe buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances . \nhe tries to find jack\'s missing cat . \nbut his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble . \nand there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness . \nthe more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy . \nwe liked greg . \nand , we liked this movie . \n \" meet the parents \" is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments . \njust sit back and watch greg get into trouble . \nno matter what the situation , whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house , things will horribly go wrong . \nwe laugh at greg\'s expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool . \ndeniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside . \ntheir tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell . \n',1
'clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976\'s murder by death . \nthis big screen version of the classic board game ( what\'s next . . . \nchutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . \nthe plot , for what it\'s worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who\'s been blackmailing them all . \nwhen he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . . \nand in what room , and with what object . \nwhile not as witty as neil simon\'s murder by death , clue definitely has it moments . \nit has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i\'m joking around with my friends . \nto this day , whenever someone says the phrase \" well , to make a long story short \" i have the follow up phrase \" too late \" ready to go . \nthe cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest . \nand colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well . \nclue is available on dvd from paramount home video . \nit includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer . \na french language audio track is also available . \nthe trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it\'s a good joke ) . \nalso , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice . \nwhen clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . \nif you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times . \nso when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . . \nthe first two endings being \" what if ? \" \nendings and the third ending being the actual ending . \nnow for the dvd release you get two choices . \nyou can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you . \n ( note : there\'s an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this . \nafter watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it . \nwhen you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) \nnow while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn\'t work well . \nfirst , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? \nmaybe someone like myself who\'s seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only . \ni\'m no technical dvd expert , but i can\'t imagine that being too hard to accomplish . \nsecondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don\'t need a distraction . \nfinally , the back of the dvd case states \" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings \" . \ni have no idea why they would word it that way , since that\'s not a special feature in the slightest . \nthe video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it\'s played on television with all three endings all the time . \nthese are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i\'ve watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd . \nthe picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i\'m thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format . \n[pg] \n',1
'robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . \npaul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . \nharry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . \nwhen jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . \nsoon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . \nthere are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . \njames garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry\'s best friends . \nstockard channing plays verna , harry\'s former partner , and possibly a former love interest . \nreese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames\' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . \ngiancarlo esposito appears as harry\'s bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain . \nwith a cast like that , it\'s almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze . \nluckily , there\'s more to the film than some sort of actor\'s recognition ceremony . \ntwilight has a solid film noir-ish plot . \nit may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days . \nthe major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber . \nhowever , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable . \nthe supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn . \nstockard channing\'s character , in particular , is a cipher . \nthere\'s more to her character than the film takes the time to describe . \nit\'s a minor , but irritating , flaw . \nwith a solid cast , and a good plot , there\'s a lot to recommend about twilight . \nit\'s biggest flaw is actually its short running time . \nat a slim 94 minutes , there\'s a lot of stuff that\'s packed into an awfully small package . \nstill , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two . \n',1
'damn those trailers . \nhad it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand\' . \nas it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director\'s chair . \nmarie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . \nshe takes a nap while he goes for a swim . \nwhen marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found . \nshe contacts authorities , but they can\'t find him either . \ndid he disappear to start a new life ? \nwas he killed by accident ? \ndid he commit suicide ? \nmarie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers . \nit\'s a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit . \nthe film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing . \nit\'s a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles . \nthis is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling . \nrampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she\'s delusional . \nthe scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking . \nshe can\'t quite get over him . \nthey\'ve been married for twenty-five years . \nthe other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too . \nthe sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon\'s `criminal lovers\' , it\'s the disney channel . \nlikely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand\' is a fine movie going experience . \nwhile it\'s hard to recommend as entertainment , it\'s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss . \nozon seems to ask what you would do , and that\'s certainly a hard question to answer . \n',1
' \" you\'ve got mail \" is the very definition of a \" cute \" movie . \nit\'s got cute stars , a cute story-line , and even cute pets . \ndespite this over-whelming cuteness ( or maybe because of it ) , i loved \" you\'ve got mail \" . \ni know , i know . \ni\'m supposed to be a film critic . \ni\'m not supposed to love transparent and formula pictures like this . \nbut darn it , somewhere along the way , \" you\'ve got mail \" reeled me in , hook , line , and sinker . \nthe movie stars tom hanks and meg ryan as two somewhat unhappy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room and quickly become close friends , without ever knowing each others identity . \nas the movie progresses , though , they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each other . \nmeanwhile , in \" real-life \" , they are bitter competitors . \nshe owns a quaint little children\'s bookstore , he owns one of those gigantic super-bookstores that offer impersonal service and discount prices . \nwhile his store threatens to run her store out of business , their online relationship grows stronger . \n \" you\'ve got mail \" is as artificial as movies come . \neverything is nice and happy and by the end , all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life . \nthere are no real conflicts , no major disappointments , no unresolved issues . \nnevertheless , i quite enjoyed it . \nin fact , i can\'t remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies . \ni think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it . \nthe fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either . \nin particular , hanks is at his best here , turning his \" charm-meter \" up to 11 . \neverytime he was on screen , he had my full attention . \nand despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business , i was rooting for him . \nit was good to see hanks back doing what he does best : playing the affable everyman . \n \" you\'ve got mail \" certainly won\'t be winning any awards , but as an exercise in pure entertainment , it\'s as good as it gets . \n',1
'scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film . \nit is about 50\% horror film and 50\% murder mystery . \nthe mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . \nscream was also known for its self-referential tone . \nmany inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . \nagain , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as \" sequels suck \" and \" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . \" \nscream 2\'s story is very similar to it\'s predecessor\'s . \nsidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . \ngale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) . \nat the premiere of stab , two students from sidney\'s college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . \nthe press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . \nthey want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . \nthe most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . \nthe rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . \nthe other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . \nthe audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . \n ( whew . ) \nthe movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch . \neven better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that\'s not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . \nthe just add to the fun of watching it . \ni recommend it for other reasons as well . \nwhat i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . \nno werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . \nit is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . \nno extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . \nthe down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say \" it\'s just a movie . \" \nthe whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . \nthey are likeable , but not outstanding . \nbut in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . \nit was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . \nthe internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i\'ll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . \nif craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i\'ll be happy to mark my calendar . \n',1
'in a flashback , the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film , the hanging garden , tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance . \nhorrified , the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows \" the rule of 6 . \" \nif you don\'t break off a kiss by the count of 6 , then you committed a sin with the boy . \nand most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has \" protection ? \" \nshe must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . \nthe richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . \nalthough some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . \nyes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn\'t choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident . \nthis delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . \nduring the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . \nfirst , he\'s an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father . \nnext , he\'s 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . \nwhen the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . \nwilliam is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . \nwilliam has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) . \nkerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . \nnicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . \nthe father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . \nhis wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . \nrounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . \nas the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . \nthe director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . \nhe takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . \nrosmary\'s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . \nas much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . \nin one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . \nalthough he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . \na woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . \nwith absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational . \ndusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . \nall of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . \nthe film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger . \nthis causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . \nin the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . \neven here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker . \nthe ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . \nthe hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . \nit is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature . \n',1
'whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films , the end result is always a mess of a script , acting , directing , and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40 . \nthe latest movie morass from hollywood , the crew , appeared equally destined to fail , a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship . \nthe scary thing is that it\'s actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month . \nthe crew works for several reasons . \nthe clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie , following four \" past their prime \" wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach . \nthe wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their \" golden paradise \" by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property . \nthe four mobsters , bobby bartellemeo ( richard dreyfuss ) , joey \" bats \" pistella ( burt reynolds ) , mike \" the brick \" donatelli ( dan hedaya ) , and tony \" mouth \" donato ( seymour cassel ) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home . \nthis \" simple plan \" suddenly goes screwy , of course , and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris ( jennifer tilly ) who wants her stepmother killed , a paranoid latin drug lord who\'s convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him , and a rat with its tail on fire . \nthe crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men . \ninstead of concentrating on bobby\'s search for his daughter , the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys , balancing the production . \nthe acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya , seymour cassel , and the great , great burt reynolds are brought out by each character\'s uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle . \na strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs . \nthe film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner , emmy award-winning director of the wonder years . \nthe quick script written by barry fanaro , screenwriter of kingpin , is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit . \nthe crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can get these days . \nthe great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids , phallus symbols in the head , or grandmothers giving head in a spa . \nin the steady flow of \" extreme \" comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main , it\'s the elder statesmen like dreyfuss , reynolds , and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice - a decent script and good acting . \n',1
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nfloating life , australia\'s first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law . \na compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . \nfloating life centers around a hong kong family\'s sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film\'s theme of family . \nthe film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia . \nwith their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one . \nthis sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy . \nthe tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . \nfloating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing\'s domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family . \nmeanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under . \namong the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch . \nthe one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia . \nemotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective . \nhis desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious . \nms . law\'s film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn\'t help but find reminiscent to wayne wang\'s acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director\'s rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn\'t help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life . \nfloating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters . \nhowever , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming\'s girlfriend from vancouver ) . \nfloating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments . \n',1
'after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \n \" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , \" he says , \" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , \'see you soon . \' \" \nof course , it\'s meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . \nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \njuzo itami\'s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \ngoro finds that tampopo\'s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \nthere\'s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people\'s lives . \na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \nthe viewer knows the husband\'s intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \nthen she falls over , dead . \nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! \nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" \ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo\'s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . \nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \nif they eat tampopo\'s ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \nit\'s pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \n',1
'mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . \nher mast famous episode , \" love\'s labour lost \" , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child . \nthe way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing . \nthere was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood\'s big blockbuster movies . \nso it\'s only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster . \nand i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint . \npeacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . \nthe first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen . \ndespite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent . \nit\'s long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . \nonce george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off . \ngeorge clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . \nhe has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . \nnicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . \nthere is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly . \nthe story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney \ngoes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt . \nthis is when leder starts to show her true stuff . \nshe starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer . \nthen we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter . \nthen that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city\'s crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them . \nmimi leder is a natural at creating suspense . \nshe reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking . \nnicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero . \nyou\'re not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . \ngeorge clooney is a real movie star . \nmany of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real . \nhe has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality . \nhe\'ll be around for a while . \ndreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker . \n',1
'metro i\'ve seen san francisco in movies many times . \nthere was 1994\'s interview with the vampire and most recently the rock . \nnow , yet again , san francisco is the setting for this movie . \neddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd . he is their top hostage negotiator , and the very best at what he does . \nwhen his best friend on the force is killed by joe ( michael wincott , in a terrific performance ) , a psychotic , demented jewel thief , roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again . \nmeanwhile , roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex-girlfriend veronica , while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who\'s an expert sniper and marksman ( michael rappaport ) . \ndespite the obligatory cop movie scenes ( does every cop/new partner movie have to start the same way ? ) \nwhere the sgt . \nassigns roper a partner , roper confronts the sarge , etc . , this film is still one heck of an explosive ride . \na scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed , and boasts some amazing car stunts . \neddie murphy shines in this tailor-made role , and for once , his character shows depth and concern . \nwhen confronting joe in prison , you can feel the anger drip from every word . \nmichael rappaport is basically throwaway . \nhe serves no purpose , except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day . \ntypical action escapist fare . \nmichael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe . \nnever before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously . \nmaybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott\'s perfectly raspy voice . \ni don\'t know . \nwhat i do know , though , is that although metro is basically a typical action retread , it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches\' . \nthe film is a triumph , and an entertaining one at that . \nit doesn\'t meander or trail off from its main character . \nan enjoyable two hours , metro is enjoyable , witty , action-packed , and fun , and makes for a great action movie that\'s perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality . \n',1
'john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . \nyou send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . \nit may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn\'t require a magical faster-than-light drive . \nin the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \n ( note that , in the 1970\'s , we really didn\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \nwhitaker\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\'s \" counselor cleavage . \" \nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . \nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . \nh . r . giger\'s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . \nthe main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn\'t live up to it . \nall we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . \nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of \" scare \" scenes stuck together . \nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . \non the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . \nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it\'s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . \nmy personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don\'t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . \nmpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) \nstars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995 \n',1
'review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders . \nliving with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house\' if they don\'t pay the rent ) . \nnello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life . \n ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . ) \nnot that these are the only things that make nello\'s life happy , however . \nhe has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master . \nin addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class\' nello . \n ( he thinks he\'s not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . ) \nbut then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) . \none day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist . \nand every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money . \neager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him . \none night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film\'s most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . \nshe gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise\'s hand . \n ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . \nunfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah\' in this tale . \naloise\'s father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . \nbad enough that they can\'t see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don\'t we ? ) , but that\'s only the start of nello\'s troubles . \naloise\'s farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . \nthis decreases nello\'s reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . \nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . \nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . \nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . \nworst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess\' , fails to win the prize at the festival . \nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . \nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? \nwill patrasche save the day ? \nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? \na dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . \neven older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated\' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . \nthere have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . \nmove over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . \nthe cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . \nit also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . \nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . \nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there\'s a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie\' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . \nthe cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . \nnot that they are the only good stars , however . \njack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . \n ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) \nalso , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . \nhe\'s another one of my favorite characters in the film . \nbut jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . \nhe brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . \nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . \nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn\'t rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \neleanor o\'sullivan of `the home news & tribune\' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . \' \nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they\'re really positive ) . \nother critics , however , were not so kind . \nstephen holden of `the new york times\' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides\' and condemned mr . voight\'s character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . \' \nin addition , `entertainment weekly\' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . \' \nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family\' movie ( it probably won\'t be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \nif you\'re looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \nsee it while you can . \nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \n',1
'a big surprise to me . \nthe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . \nthey replaced him just fine . \nnot with john goodman , he didn\'t do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . \nthe fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who\'s ten . \nthis was another of my fears for the film , but he\'s a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . \nthings that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . \ni\'m quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . \nthere\'s a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . \nit\'s just the music . \none of my problems with the first is that cab calloway\'s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there\'s no problems with this . \nthe music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can\'t sing , all the musicians do a great job . \nthe only real problems i had was the special effects . \nthese were superfluous and a waste of money . \nsince the film isn\'t doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . \nthe bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide . \n-- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/ \nremove no spam to reply . \n \" drive carefully but recklessly \" , mama , child\'s toy \" the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise . \" \npeter o\'toole \n',1
'the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang\'s film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren\'t any superheroes . \ninstead , wang\'s film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \narthur\'s professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \nit\'s the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \narthur\'s not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \narthur\'s girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \narthur\'s best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \njoey is married to arthur\'s jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \narthur\'s 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \nhe finds it impossible to meet his father\'s lofty expectations . \nthe various people in arthur\'s life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \nlike wang\'s earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \nwang\'s direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \ngriffith . \ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee\'s films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \nmason daring\'s score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it\'s sometimes ambitious to a fault . \nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it\'s hard to digest them all . \nfor instance , one character ( arthur\'s sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don\'t care about her marital problems . \nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \n',1
'showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . \ntheir last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone\'s taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . \npossibly that movie\'s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . \nand that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters\' future , so there was no need to film it . \nthere was actually about four hours\' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . \nthe major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . \nwe have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who\'s trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . \nbut recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . \nin this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who\'s not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we\'re left feeling good about her future . \nthis is not one of the great movies , but it\'s far better than we\'d been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . \nverhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . \nhis most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he\'s exploring the sleeze . \nthis movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director\'s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . \n ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) \nmany reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it\'s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . \nit\'s about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . \nit\'s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don\'t pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . \nan nc-17 movie which isn\'t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . \nthe one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . \nif anything , it\'s a rape scene with a victim who\'s been duped into cooperation . \nyou don\'t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don\'t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don\'t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . \nand in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . \nthis is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . \nshowgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . \nnomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who\'s at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she\'s known . \nshe has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . \nwhen nomi realizes she\'s gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . \ngina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi\'s entire life . \nmolly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she\'ll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi\'s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi\'s decision . \ngina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who\'s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . \ngershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . \nher character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . \nthe relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . \nit is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . \ncristal is a talented dancer who\'s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . \nnomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn\'t need las vegas or its brand of \" stardom . \" \nthe male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . \nkyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . \nglenn plummer plays a dancer who\'s working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . \nplummer\'s character is the only one in the movie who\'s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he\'s succumbed to the cult of manipulation . \nplummer\'s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . \nsome of jost vacano\'s cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi\'s character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . \nthis movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . \ni don\'t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . \nbut don\'t go see it if you\'re not in a tough mood ; the only person it\'s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . \non life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you\'d enjoy meeting in person . \n',1
'the first thing you notice about this movie is that it\'s cold . \nplaced in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white . \njust what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . \nas with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . \na car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . \nalong the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . \nin brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . \nthere is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . \nremarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . \neven more remarkably , it works . \nthe only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity . \nwith every good film the audience gains new knowledge . \nhere you learn _two_ things . \neveryone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy . \nand don\'t do violent illegal business with low-life amoral degenerate scum-sucking losers . \noh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy . \n',1
'quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie . \nhe runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain . \neventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal . \nsince he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it . \ntheir scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money . \ninstead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won\'t eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl . \nof course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time . \nyou could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined . \ndennis quaid makes a fine hero . \npete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them . \ndina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl . \nbut lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is . \nconnery\'s voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon . \nso , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie . \nif you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script . \n',1
'when quentin tarantino made \" pulp fiction \" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . \nbut before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to \" citizen kane \" , hear me out . \nmuch like \" citizen kane \" , \" pulp fiction \" has changed movie making forever . \nbut i think the latter has had a tad more impact . \n \" pulp fiction \" has actually ushered in a new era of film making . \nit has altered the way films will be viewed . \n \" fiction \" has spawned so many imitations , i\'ve lost count . \nsure , some have been excellent ( \" bound \" and \" the usual suspects \" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes \" pulp fiction \" as the original neo-noir of the 90s . \nin this review , i hope to change all the people\'s minds who have criticized it for it\'s excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn\'t really that graphic ) . \nthe most brilliant aspect of tarantino\'s masterpiece is the screenplay . \nit is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the \" quarter pounder with cheese \" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn\'t already . \nthe story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine . \nthe first , titled \" vincent vega and marcellus wallace\'s wife \" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim\'s . \nthey talk for a while ( with the occasional \" uncomfortable silence \" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror . \nafter giving marcellus\' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a \" speech impediment \" . \nthey also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic \" you never can tell \" . \ni won\'t reveal the rest of the story , but i\'ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win . \nthe second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the \" die hard \" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge . \npreviously in the film ( like i said , it\'s told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match . \nas it turns out , he not only doesn\'t take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent . \nhe takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend\'s apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence . \non his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus . \nthe two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous \" gimp \" scene , which is very reminicent of the \" squeal like a pig ! \" \nscene from \" deliverance \" . \nthe last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car . \nthey seek help with a friend of jackson\'s ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball . \nthey end up calling a \" cleaner \" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . \nin the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began . \nif you haven\'t already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition . \nit features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen . \nearlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago . \nwhat the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable . \nthat version cut out , like , half the movie . \nwhat i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing . \nfor instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses . \nthis might help explain the divine intervention that takes place . \njust a theory . . . \none of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e . \n \" psycho \" \" kiss me deadly \" , \" deliverance \" , etc . ) . \nbut why shouldn\'t he ? \nit\'s not like he out-right and blatantly stole . \ngive the guy a break . \nin case you haven\'t already noticed , i believe \" pulp fiction \" is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as \" casablanca \" and \" the godfather \" ) . \ntrust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s . \nand besides , it\'s one hell of a ride . \nnote : if anyone knows how i could get a \" bad motherfucker \" wallet , please e-mail me . \nany help would be greatly appreciated . \n',1
'it\'s a curious thing - i\'ve found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie , he\'s much better and so is the movie . \neven though , in the sixth sense he is the \" name \" , he doesn\'t have the pivotal role . \nthat honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts . \nif osment was cute or precious , the director going for the maudlin , this would be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week , thankfully , osment is not only better than that , but in some instances , blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance . \nwe get to see his fears , vulnerabilities , strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i\'ve seen this year . \nthe whole cast matches him in quality , with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter . \none thing about this movie , its target . \nthis isn\'t a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest , this is more what i\'d call a supernatural drama , more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup . \none caveat : there\'s a lovely twist in the movie , something like the usual suspects , where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen . \ni was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , before any hype or critical reviews were out , so i went in with no biases . \nif anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it , don\'t let them . \nlet the director explain on his own pace and you\'ll enjoy the movie vastly more . \n',1
'in december of 1996 , a little movie called \" scream , \" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . \nfirst , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both \" scream \" movies , \" i know what you did last summer , \" \" urban legend , \" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a \'la \'80s john hughes ) , starting with last june\'s \" can\'t hardly wait . \" \nit may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : \" varsity blues , \" \" jawbreaker , \" \" cruel intentions , \" \" simply irresistible , \" \" the rage : carrie 2 , \" and \" the mod squad . \" \ncoming april 9 are two more of this type : \" never been kissed \" and \" go , \" and on april 23 , we\'ve got the teen satire \" election \" and the teen horror-comedy \" idle hands . \" \njeesh ! \nout of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" is this past january\'s mediocre , ho-hum \" she\'s all that . \" \nalthough similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" a modern-day version of shakespeare\'s \" the taming of the shrew \" ( \" she\'s all that \" got its inspiration from \" pygmalion \" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985\'s \" the breakfast club . \" \nand to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn\'t have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in \" she\'s all that ? \" ) . \nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \nalthough he doesn\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \ncomplicating matters , cameron\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \nas you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\'t even mentioned , such as kat\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she\'s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you\'re vapor \" ) . \nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \naside from a good screenplay , it\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \'60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" \nat another point , bianca and kat\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\'s like to be pregnant . \n \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \'90s . \nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \nby the film\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \n',1
'imagine this . \nyou\'re given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training . \na man you don\'t know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live . \nyou are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die . \nyou frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you . \nyou watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood . \nif you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you\'re going to have to do it all over again tomorrow . \neventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you\'re going to die . \nthis is the life of a gladiator . \nyou\'ll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott\'s powerful gladiator , you\'ll be thankful for that . \nwith his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire . \nand like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script . \nsince the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited . \n>from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious . \nrome\'s best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania . \nscott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective . \nit\'s blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted . \nas soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . \nit\'s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch . \ninstead , the general swears he will get out after this battle . \nhe wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life . \nbut , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that . \nthe dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies . \nhe asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators . \nall of this does not go well for aurelius\' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor . \njealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus\' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus . \nbut maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius\' wishes . \nnow a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success . \na story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick . \nyou actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way . \nphoenix plays his character brilliantly . \nthink of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , \" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man \" brat who hates when he\'s not the center of attention . \nevery scene we see commodus , he\'s either crying or he looks like he has just been crying . \nphoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he\'s more than just river\'s little brother . \ncrowe is also excellent as the film\'s grisly-faced hero . \nmaximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions . \nthis guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he\'s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! \nthe rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate . \nridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general . \nthe visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 . \nthe costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians . \ngladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience . \nalong with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 . \n',1
'on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento\'s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \nwhile it\'s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento\'s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director\'s brilliance as a stylist . \nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \ninstead , tenebrae\'s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \nand the soundtrack\'s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \nsome critics argue that logic doesn\'t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don\'t deserve to feel cheated . \nby the way , if you don\'t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \nhe is insane , apparently . \nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it\'s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film\'s bloody climax . \nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer\'s house . \nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \nin other words , he\'s almost in two places at once . \nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \nby the film\'s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \nthe injury ? \nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa\'s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren\'t even introduced too ! \nthat\'s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story\'s flaws ? \nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer\'s lair . \nit\'s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \nand that\'s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \ntoo often , it seems , argento\'s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \nand if you\'re a fan of argento\'s unique style of giallo thriller then it\'s essential . \nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \nit\'s a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \na shame , because it doesn\'t have to be that way . \ntake argento\'s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \n',1
'at one point during brian de palma\'s crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : \" can\'t you stop saying \'fuck\' all the time ? \" \nfucking good question , that . \nit may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone\'s script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . \nyet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma\'s scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick . \nthe overall structure is similar to howard hawks\' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero\'s chosen vice is cocaine traffiking . \npacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream . \nand live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder . \nfrom his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he\'s not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) . \nsoon he\'s the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . \n \" never do your own stash \" , warns one character early in the film . \nas sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls . \nwriter oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here . \nstone\'s script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development . \nmontana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience . \na man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits . \npacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting . \npfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life . \nonly once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she\'s happy to oblige . \nthis isn\'t as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone\'s was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . \nas director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva . \nthe escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola . \nwhere he differs from , say , coppola\'s godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment . \ncoppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel . \nand it perfectly suits the material . \nthe only major botch is giorgio moroder\'s mostly crap synthesier score . \nit\'s just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes . \nas expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn\'t be watching gangster movies if that upsets you . \nat over two and a half hours in length it\'s a true epic , and if you\'re a fan of the genre you\'ll love f * * k-filled minute of it . \n',1
'john sayles\' \" men with guns \" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . \nthe film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . \nmost of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . \nall people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . \nhowever , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . \nthere is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . \nthe film\'s main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . \none of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . \nfuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . \nwith government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . \nthis program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . \nhowever , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . \nas he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . \nwhen dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we didn\'t . \" \nrational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others\' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . \ndr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . \nfirst , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . \nnext , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . \nthrough his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . \nalong the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . \nas domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . \nlast , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn\'t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . \nsayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in \" men with guns . \" \n ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) \nhe creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . \ntheir uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film\'s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo\'s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes\' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn\'t ) . \nthe setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . \nsayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in \" matewan \" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in \" lone star \" ( 1996 ) . \nsayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( \" gattaca \" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . \nsayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . \nthe one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . \nit would not be a stretch to say that \" men with guns \" is a depressing film . \nin fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . \nin addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo\'s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . \nnevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . \nthe last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , \" nobody refuses the men with guns . \" \n',1
'although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama \'the sopranos , \' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it\'s own right . \nbilly crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new \'patient\' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . ) \nben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he\'s about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn\'t really help . \nbut ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out . \nall done in a comic fashion , of course . \nalthough never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride . \nbilly crystal , who hasn\'t had a good role since city slickers way back in the early \'90\'s , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act . \nhe\'s pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he\'s pretty funny . \nrobert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny . \nhe\'s a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine . \nlisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals\' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn\'t come off well on the screen . \nthe supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti\'s bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . ) \nthe film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking . \nit sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in . \nspoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather . \nthe italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun . \nthere\'s also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason . \nit is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script . \nunfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know . \nharold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack . \nall the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience . \nthe script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory . \nthe film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll . \nanalyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching . \nrobert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . ) \ncrystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome . \nit\'s no goodfellas , and it probably won\'t be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won\'t leave you feel cheated . \n',1
'james jones , one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century , has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual . \na veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature . \nthey are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor-sharp focus . \nbut perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel , the thin red line ; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick . \nthe book\'s principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value . \neach of the roles has an everyman quality , emphasizing jones\' examination of world war ii on the american soldier . \nthere\'s a definitive chain of command present , and this also plays on the motivations of the cast . \nbut most importantly , and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie , a dynamic and effective voice-over is used . \nmalick has several characters relating their thoughts , giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake . \nthe issues at stake are many and one . \ntold from a limited third-person perspective ( as opposed to a top-down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( \" c-for-charlie \" ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal . \nthe south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war . \nand want to win the war they do . \nin an excellent performance , nick nolte plays c-for-charlie\'s commanding officer , lt . col . gordon tall . \nhe\'s an aging soldier who embodies the win-at-all-costs mentality , if only to impress his superior ( john travolta , in a questionable cameo ) . \nthis philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros ( elias koteas ) , who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command . \nat the front are the privates and corporals ( adrien brody , james caviezel , ben chaplin , et al ) , lead by 1st sgt . \nwelsh ( sean penn ) , who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them . \nthe thin red line is filled with intense , visual poetry , but it\'s nearly three hours long . \nalthough the interest level is high throughout the first two hours , the climax comes forty-five minutes before the end of the movie ; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end . \nthe thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998\'s other masterpiece of war , saving private ryan a countless number of times . \nbut to do so is to belittle both films , for although similarities abound , so do differences . \ndirector malick has a story to tell , and for those interested in listening , this can be a very outstanding movie . \n',1
'\'lake placid\' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever . \nactually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film . \nwell the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror/comedies they are . \ni will admit that \'lake placid\' isn\'t an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny . \nbridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half . \nshe gets there but really doesn\'t understand why she is there . \nbill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on . \nwhat they find though isn\'t great . \na huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . \nthey have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from . \nbetty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you\'ll have to see the movie to find out . \nher character is very funny and foul-mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny . \nto me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws . \nwith the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is . \nwhen you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . \ndavid e . kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job . \nthe characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one-liners . \nbut believe me , don\'t take \'lake placid\' too seriously or you won\'t like it . \nbut it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun \'popcorn\' type movie . \nbut i guess it rates above the \'popcorn\' rating . \nsit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want . \neven though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore . \nthere\'s really not that much gore , but what there is might seem kinda gross to some . \n\'lake placid\' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too . \n',1
'kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . \nall he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he\'s thinking . \n \" detective story \" features one of kirk douglas\'s finest performances . \nhe stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night . \nthe film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective\'s work in . \nthe film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there . \nthe bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate . \nhowever , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas\'s wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of . \nmany secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film . \nsecrets i would not dream of giving away . \nwith a name like \" detective story \" , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of \" nypd blue \" , but it doesn\'t quite work out that way . \nhowever , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time . \nlee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting . \nher scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs . \nthe performances all around are fantastic . \ndouglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he\'s not the center of attention all the time . \nwe get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases . \nwhich brings me back to douglas . \nhe has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him . \nwe can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he\'s really done is gotten back at his criminal father . \nhow he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing . \nkirk douglas is the kind of actor we don\'t seem to see to much of these days : he\'s a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior . \n',1
'i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou . \n ( huh ? ) \nwell , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in . \nhe and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck . \nagainst his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities . \nthe rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? \na simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle . \noh , and its much better than any of those . \nsam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . \nhe really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . \ni think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . \none of the film\'s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick\'s the thin red line . \nin malick\'s three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story . \nit seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water . \nsure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts . \nraimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . \ni think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . \nand then there\'s billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood . \nif it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok . \nhe gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here . \nit is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so . \njacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought . \ni wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn\'t know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . \nhere he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . \nthough the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . \npaxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . \nperhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn\'t do anything ruin the picture . \na simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming . \nbut at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts . \n',1
'maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it\'s not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively . \nbecause it\'s not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it\'s so great . \nunderneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way . \nit doesn\'t merely go from plot point to plot point . \nit goes from character to character . \nit obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship . \nit\'s that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike \" patch adams , \" effortlessly emotional and real . \nin short , this movie is just awesome . \nit merely tells its story really well , and that\'s something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they\'re not told by great storytellers . \ndirector anand tucker tells this story well . \nhe overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real . \nthe film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends . \nthey are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two . \njackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned . \nwhen they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) . \nthey marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she\'s alone . \nshe enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary\'s country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure . \nit\'s all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar \" shine \" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn\'t been handled in such a way . \nthe key thing here is that it\'s not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it\'s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized . \ntheir relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they\'re also completely jealous of one another . \nwhen a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can\'t , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . \nwhen jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i\'ve ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) . \nand the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . \nanother thing i really liked is emily watson\'s performance . \ni usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . \nmy reasoning for this is that it\'s a fucking easy job . \nthe worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in \" beloved \" : sure , she\'s good , but what\'s so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old\'s body ? \nhell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . \nin that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother\'s lover is scared off . \nshe has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about . \nbut the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . \nif you don\'t believe me , look at jack nicholson\'s performance in \" as good as it gets \" : great performance , but easy job . \nthis isn\'t so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point . \nand thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we\'ve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . \nrachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson\'s protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her . \ngriffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from \" breaking the waves \" and \" the boxer \" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who\'ve already deemed watson\'s performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she\'s the one who doesn\'t get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . \nafter all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in \" rainman \" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) . \nshe does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it\'s griffiths . \ntogether , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven\'t been seen this year . \nif it hadn\'t been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i\'d say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . \nit\'s so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it\'s nearly a shame that it\'s not the flawless gem that it should be . \nbut , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain . \n',1
'melvin van peebles\' \" sweet sweetback\'s baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \nin style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \nvan peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \nthe movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film\'s responsibilities himself . \nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all-white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \nhe also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \nthe storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . \nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they\'re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \nvan peebles\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \nat the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" \nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \nof course , with today\'s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn\'t seem all that revolutionary . \nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \nat that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles\' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" \nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \n \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \n \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \nhowever , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . \nwhen it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \nstill others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \nnevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \nit is a revolutionary movie not because it\'s about one man\'s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \nthe fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . \nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . \nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . \ndon\'t let them kill him . \nlet him die on his own . \" \nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn\'t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! \na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" \nbeyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \nhe shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \nwatching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \nthe legacy of \" sweet sweetback\'s baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \n',1
'the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you \" it\'s just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\'s movie . \naround 70\% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn\'t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you\'ll feel a tingle even if you didn\'t see the movie when it first came out in \'77 . \nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we\'re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n',1
'the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it\'s adequately explained by the commercials . \nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a \" pageant \" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \nand if there wasn\'t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \n ( a heist comedy ? \nyup . \ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \nwag the dog succeeds because it\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \nok , maybe it\'s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \n ( any average person who thinks that they\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \nand because we\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \ninstead , david mamet\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \nit\'s all : \" what do i love ? \nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \nit\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\'s so excited that he can\'t even shut up . \neven on the edge of disaster , he\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \ninsiders note that he\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\'t . \nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\'d go see it . \nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\'t . \n',1
'wow ! what a movie . \nit\'s everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . \nyep that pretty much describes this movie . \nit starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . \nit boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . \nbesides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . \nperiod . \nthen again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . \njohn cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . \nhis wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . \ncraig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you \nhave to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . \nhe is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . \nin his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . \nto his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich\'s mind . \nfifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . \nhe returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich\'s mind , she doesn\'t believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . \nlotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . \njohn malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don\'t know what really happened . \njohn cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . \nhe fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . \ncameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world\'s most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . \nshe however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . \ncatherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . \nthe whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . \nspike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . \nhe lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . \nby the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . \nthe screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . \nthe film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . \nthe whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . \nfrom cameron diaz\'s appearence to john malkovich\'s explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . \nthere isn\'t a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . \nthere are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i\'ve seen in a long time . \ni found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . \nby the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn\'t want to make movies like this anymore . \nor why they don\'t . \nall filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . \nthis was a surprise hit as was american beauty . \n\'being john malkovich\' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . \nit has something that no other movies playing now has . \nin fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . \ni highly recommend \'being john malkovich\' and have no doubts you will be disappointed . \n',1
'edward zwick\'s \" the siege \" raises more questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate . \nits subject is the rising threat of terrorism in american cities . \ndenzel washington is anthony \" hub \" hubbard , who runs the fbi\'s anti-terrorism task force in new york . \nhis investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies when suicide bombers take out a busload of people . \nhub focuses on a mysterious cia operative ( annette bening ) , whose goes by both \" elise \" and \" sharon . \" \nas the terrorist attacks continue and the body count rises , the question of martial law is raised . \nenter general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who opposes martial law at first but who , as soon as the president decides to send in the army , begins herding arab immigrants into a prison camp and attacking every link that hub uncovers in the terrorist chain . \nhub listens as devereaux tortures and murders a suspect . \nthe future zwick and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible . \nwhat would happen , they ask , if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is in cities like beirut and belfast ? \nwhat would happen to our civil liberties if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns ? \nthese questions \" the siege \" answers in realistic detail . \nit implies tougher ones , though : what can be done to combat terrorism without sacrificing justice and freedom ? \nif we encourage terrorism abroad ( from bening\'s character we discover that the cia trained the bombers ) , will it inevitably come back to us ? \n \" siege \" avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero , hub , with a uncompromising sense of clear right and wrong . \nthis comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils of the modern world is an escape from the thought-provoking issues the movie raises . \nstill , zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies ( willis\' \" die hard \" series , for example ) offer only a comic-book view on terrorism . \n',1
'recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources . \neach review compared this film to the truman show . \nwhy ? \nthe only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . \nother than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . \nreviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . \nthe truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . \nwhen pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . \nthe same goes for the thin red line , as well . \nwhen it opened in decemeber , probably 98\% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg\'s saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . \ncritics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . \nthis is why i think pleasantville was underrated . \nif the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it\'s long been on the video store shelves . \nsure , it wasn\'t perfect , and it wasn\'t very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history . \nwith the exception of don knotts as the annoying \" tv repairman \" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm\'s tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50\'s sitcom \" pleasantville \" to escape from his feuding parents . \nhis twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes . \nbut what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90\'s terms such as \" like \" , \" whatever \" , and \" cool \" make her sound like the total dimwit she\'s supposed to be . \nthe twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . \ntheir new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way . \ntheir new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville . \nafter the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form . \nit\'s just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don\'t want it to end . \n \" mary sue \" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color . \nsoon we learn that these people don\'t know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color . \nthis eventually sparks a racial war between the \" coloreds \" and the \" black & whites . \" \nentertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , \" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . \" \nyes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent . \nbut the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it\'s what i least expected . \ngary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece-he just tries to convey moral messages within his work . \ntake for example big and dave , his past films . \nbig-be careful what you wish for . \ndave-good or bad lying is still lying . \ndid these movies win big awards ? \nno , but they won the heart of millions . \npleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn\'t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films . \npleasantville : a- ad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \ni like it . \ni like breathing through it . \" \n-jack nicholson , chinatown \n',1
'i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one , folks . \ni loved the wedding singer . \nbut it gets worse . \nif i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence . \n . \n . \nhell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i\'m bound to be lynched . \nwell lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception . \nright away , you\'re ready to discount my review , aren\'t you ? \nyou\'re thinking that i can\'t possibly know what i\'m talking about . \nafter all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ? \nwell , there\'s more . \n . \n . \ni actually got choked up , and more than once . \nyes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes . \nbut before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself . \nthe wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so . \nbut when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn\'t exist for people like him . \nin the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character . \njulia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the \" miami vice \" loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn\'t seem all that interested . \nas the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he\'s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women . \nit\'s obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her , but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ? \nthis isn\'t sleepless in seattle , but i\'d actually compare it to that before i\'d compare it to happy gilmore . \nwhile the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor , its sincerity and charm carry it a very , very long way . \nsandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously . \nbarrymore seems perfect along side him , and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) , the two go together like bread and butter as a mid-eighties couple . \none scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears . \nunfortunately , sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no-brainer , but it\'s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i\'m encouraging everyone to go see it . \nin fact , the entire theater applauded when the film ended , and laughs were so consistent , some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar . \nthe 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth , and for those of us that are old enough to remember it , it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well ) . \nsandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? ) . \nwhile the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit , grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars . \nit\'s hilarious , and it\'s touching . \nit\'s got that great cheezy humor , but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected . \nthis is one to see again and again . \nis it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 ? \nmy \" magic 8-ball \" predicts it is certain . \n',1
'robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . \nin \" the natural \" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be \" the best there ever was , \" but still acted like a humble farm boy . \nin \" butch cassidy and the sundance kid \" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . \neven in \" indecent proposal \" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . \nin his latest film , \" the horse whisperer , \" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . \nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . \ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase \" horse whisperer \" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . \nbooker\'s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . \nthe accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace\'s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace\'s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . \nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . \nat first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn\'t work . \ninstead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . \nin many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . \nthe move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it\'s hard not to see annie and grace\'s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . \nin \" the horse whisperer , \" country is clearly the victor . \nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace\'s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie\'s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . \nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed \" a river runs through it \" six years ago . \nin many ways , \" the horse whisperer \" comes from the same poetic vein as \" river , \" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . \nbut then , that would ruin the magic . \nmuch of the film\'s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . \nto further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( \" natural born killers , \" \" platoon \" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \nin terms of the story itself , \" the horse whisperer \" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean\'s \" a brief encounter \" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood\'s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller\'s \" the bridges of madison county \" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted \" bridges \" ) . \nalthough \" the horse whisperer \" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who\'s being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \nin \" the horse whisperer , \" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \nhe plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \nit\'s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie\'s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \nthe best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \nalthough booker\'s horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make \" the horse whisperer \" worth the price of admission . \n',1
'synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\'afro . \nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \ncomments : \" star trek : the next generation \" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to \" star trek , \" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , \" star trek : the next generation \" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original \" star trek \" \'s cast in paramount\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth \" star trek \" movie and the third to focus on the \" star trek : the next generation \" crew . \nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between \" okay \" and \" good . \" \nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant \" star trek : voyager \" tv series , \" star trek \" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \ni don\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \nmost people reading this probably haven\'t followed \" star trek \" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \nokay . let\'s move to the movie itself . \nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\'s crew . \naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\'ku homeworld . \nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\'a . \nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\'ku and plunder the planet\'s youth-restoring properties . \nsound pretty heavy ? \nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\'s constant barrage of humor . \nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \nsince they\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \ndespite many other critics\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\'afro well enough . \nru\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \nlike the baron , ru\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \nru\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \na particular plot point involving anij\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \ndespite star trek : insurrection\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \nit maintains roddenberry\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \ni\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \nrated pg , i can\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \n',1
'the seasoned capt . dudley smith ( james cromwell ) questions his new protege , ed exley ( guy pearce ) about his political views when it comes to police work . \n \" would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty ? \nwould you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved ? \" \nexley , squeaky clean , innocent , and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed \'no . \' \nstunned , smith pleads , \" then , for the love of god , don\'t be a detective . \" \nla confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s . \norganized crime was the biggest concern , corruption existed everywhere , and every cop had his own way of getting the job done . \nthere was \" hollywood \" jack vincennes ( kevin spacey ) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid , sid hudgeons ( danny devito ) . \nsporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat , he isn\'t afraid to flash his tinseltown style . \ndetective bud white ( russell crowe ) has only a narrow-minded view of the law , and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice . \nand then there is golden boy exley , wide-eyed and ambitious but extremely naive . \na horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together , each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth , action , and personal vindication . \nalmost immediately , an arrest is made . \nbut something doesn\'t seem quite right . \nnew developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department . \nsuspicion and questions begin to mount . \nodd alliances are created . \nand as layers of the truth become revealed , the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment . \nwhen the mystery expands , we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops , including a high-priced hooker ( kim basinger ) and a shady millionaire ( david strathairn ) . \nall of the characters\' levels of involvement are not immediately clear . \nwe watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case . \nwe sense a cross-pollination of clues that brings us , the audience , closer to the truth . \nwe hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery . \nabsorbing and affecting , this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir . \nit boasts mysterious figures in control , double-crosses , hard information from sleazy sources , dirty politicians , corrupt cops , haunting women , and hard-nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity . \nthe underlying mystery is compelling . \nthe look and feel of the movie is gorgeous . \nthe entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch ( i wouldn\'t be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance ) . \nand , the dialogue is rich and memorable . \nthe best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do . \n \" don\'t start trying to do the right thing , boy-o , \" says he . \n \" you haven\'t had the practice . \" \n \" l . a . confidential\'\' triumphantly achieves the rare gift of complexity and coherence while satisfying our desire for a good old-fashioned movie . \n',1
'plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention . \nthe boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road . \nwho\'s on the up and up , who\'s the real bad guy and who\'s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie . \ncritique : the funnest movie that i\'ve seen so far this year ! \nit\'s got style , it\'s got tough guys talkin\' shite and it\'s got plenty of bullets to go around . \na definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin\' adventure ! \na guy\'s guy movie through and through , and one that\'ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff . \nit\'s not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin\' elvis lovers , who don\'t stop till they , more or less , drop . \nthis movie\'s got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i\'ve ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin\' and the king\'s music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments . \nin fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim . \nbut the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell\'s been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . \ni guess he\'s pissed at all the box-office bombs that he\'s been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here . \nin the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin\' ass and making sure there\'s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards . \nand smoke \'em if you got \'em , folks ! \nthere is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that\'ll have you crackin\' up and lovin\' it all at the same time . \nthe violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that\'ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next . \nit should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works . \nthe film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse . \ni was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well . \nand did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? \nno . . . okay , \nwell i just did ! \ni coulda done without her whole \" romance \" angle , but to be honest , it doesn\'t take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods . \ntry to see how many \" inside \" connections to the king you can guess . \nof course , it\'s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind . \ni also like these types of \" guy \" movies a lot , and even though the film doesn\'t bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol\' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell\'s respective boots . \nprobably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure . \nnow see how many elvis songs i\'ve used to pun my way through this phony review below . \nthe elvis songs also recommend this movie ! \nso whether you\'re lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain\'t one to return to the sender . \ni really beg of you , whether you\'re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender . \nand no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you\'re the devil in disguise himself , i think you won\'t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either . \nso don\'t be cruel , don\'t turn away , don\'t curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film . \nit\'s now or never , folks . \ntrust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i\'d seen so far this year is far behind me . \njoblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building . \nthank you . . . thank \nyou very much ! ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ?

'hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . \nit\'s a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . \ni mean , come on . \nare people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? \nhell no . \nand not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . \nand not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk \'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . \nthis is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . \ni got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . \nand that is exactly what this film is ; art . \ni\'ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . \nlet me backtrack a minute . \nwhen i say \" intellectual ground \" , i don\'t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . \nwith most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . \nthose movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . \nyou see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . \nthis is a thinking man\'s slasher flick . \nthe \" nosferatu \" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . \nhe employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . \nupon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock\'s castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter\'s ) . \nthe next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not \nreally a good sign . \nhe then discovers through some reading that the count is a \" nosferatu \" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . \nbut by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter\'s hometown via boat . \nwill hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? \nthe character of orlock is , of course , dracula . \nthe only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker\'s novel . \njust thought that was an interesting little side note . . . \nprobably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment\'s digitally restored cut , now available in stores . \nhowever , this version is quite different than maunau\'s original masterpiece . \nthe movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang\'s metropolis . \nnow , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . \nbut alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . \nbut that\'s just my bag ; you may like the newer , more \" modern \" version better . \neither way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . \nif you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . \nif you\'re like me , just do what i\'ll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made . \n',1

'notting hill\'s trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . \nthe movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . \nand it apparently worked . \nperhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill\'s opening weekend success , but the film\'s staying power is based on word of mouth . \nallow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . \ngrant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . \ninto his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . \na common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . \ndays later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair . \n ( aside : notting hill\'s portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . ) \nonly anna\'s celebrity-or william\'s lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them . \nrichard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture\'s \" beauty and the beast \" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order . \nas with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it\'s william\'s ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna . \ncurtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple\'s situation is not enough to fuel two hours\' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill\'s finest moments revolve around william\'s eccentric friends and family . \nby now , dear reader , you\'ve probably heard a lot about rhys ifans\' performance as william\'s imbecilic welsh flatmate . \nyes , he\'s a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband . \nin the movie\'s best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max\'s latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life . \nthe scene ends only as a british writer would end it . \nif anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot\'s dramatic impact . \nroberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings\' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they\'re lonely . \n ( worth noting in roberts\' and grant\'s favour : the ubiquitous \" i\'m just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her \" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) \nnotting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell\'s playful changing-of-the-seasons number . \nif only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch . \n',1
'review- peter jackson\'s the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag . \nbut for those who were dismayed by this year\'s blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . \nand for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . \nthe frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . \nmichael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . \nhe uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . \nthis is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . \nfrank\'s latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . \nwhen dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . \nbut dobson\'s spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he\'s dead . \nthis leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . \nthings start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . \nfox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . \nso when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . \nfox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector\'s hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox\'s attempts to save her from this evil spirit . \nthere are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . \nthe movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . \nthe mix between these genres are perfect . \nno laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . \none point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . \nbut that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . \nmichael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife\'s death , and then is forced to confront this later on . \nalvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . \nand jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . \nthe frighteners never once feels like it is running long . \nthe first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . \nthis movie is probably what casper would\'ve looked like if david lynch directed it . \nit\'s easily the best film of the year , so far . \n',1

'apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don\'t know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \ni\'ve heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye\'s focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \nit\'s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton\'s fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d\'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek\'s adoption of white supremacy . \nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \nit\'s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it\'s interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he\'s also very smart . \nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \nit\'s clear that he\'s passionate about his beliefs , and that he\'s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \nit\'s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \nin addition to getting the look just right , he\'s perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \neven when he\'s at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that\'s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny\'s school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d\'angelo , and lien . \nvisually , the film is very powerful . \nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \nit\'s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n',1
'david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . \nwith his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . \nsome of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . \nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . \noh , and it\'s rated g . \nincidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else\'s work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . \nhe casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . \n \" did you do it ? \" he asks his boy . \n \" no father , i didn\'t , \" ronnie answers . \nthat\'s enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son\'s case to court . \nthey enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task . \nit all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century . \nbut arthur is determined to keep his family\'s word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that . \nsoon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings . \nso do we . \nall david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent . \nthe characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense . \nbut this is not mamet\'s norm , and it\'s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were . \nnigel hawthorne\'s performance is nearly flawless . \nhis delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game . \nwe pity the man , but we also like him . \nrebecca pidgeon , david mamet\'s wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur\'s oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women\'s suffrage movement . \nthe winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one . \nbe honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ? \nif you wanted to but didn\'t , this is a movie for you . \nit is the epitome of subtlety : it\'s powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing . \ndavid mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too . \nhe is almost a national treasure . \nhis films deserve their own genre . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n',1

'call me crazy , but i don\'t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . \na good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . \nan utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg\'s best work , no . \npersonally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn\'t go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler\'s list and the indiana jones movies . \ni\'m guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn\'t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . \nall lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . \nthe difference is , it\'s easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon\'s chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it\'s damn hard to sit and eat reese\'s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . \nand believe me , there\'s plenty of it . \na 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . \nlives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . \ncut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . \none woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . \ni guess it\'s an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . \nthat way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . \none good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it\'s a mission designed to make the army look good . \nthey question the worth of risking eight soldiers\' lives to save one , and hanks\' character admits he doesn\'t give a damn about ryan ; he\'s just following orders . \nif this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . \nthere\'d be a phony , \" let\'s go get that boy , gosh darn it ! \" \nattitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . \nby doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has . \nit makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission . \nthe movie\'s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers . \nhanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . \nit\'s not that way for long . \nedward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn\'t available , is the impulsive one . \njeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . \nnone of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg\'s obvious intention . \ni wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours\' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? \nthere are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson\'s company ( apparently , danson joined the army after \" ink \" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it\'s the wrong ryan . \nand of course the movie\'s far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn\'t available ) . \nthat\'s when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . \nsaving private ryan is worth your time , but it\'s definitely no schindler\'s list . \nthe battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren\'t . \nthe movie\'s bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , \" tell me i\'ve led a good life . \ntell me i\'m a good man . \" \nspielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . \nmuch more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks\' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they\'re doing by pretending they\'re playing poker . \nthis while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . \nby not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . \nand even if it\'s not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there . \n',1
'only a year after the initial release of \" scream , \" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel \" scream 2 \" has arrived in our theaters . \nwhile the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it\'s really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . \nthe first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant . \nthe premise of \" scream 2 \" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called \" stab , \" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in \" scream , \" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening . \ni had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy . \nits conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it\'s a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else . \nthe satire in \" scream 2 \" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general . \nalthough resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . \neverything from \" friends \" and \" saved by the bell \" to \" showgirls \" and \" terminator 2 \" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren\'t any \" wes carpenter \" jokes this time . \nmore importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . \nthe killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from \" scream \" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine\'s life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show . \nunderstandably , \" scream 2 \" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted . \ncouple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right . \nwe don\'t just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner . \nwhile i have not seen any of his other work , it\'s easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated \" slasher film \" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . \nunfortunately , \" scream 2 \" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window . \nfor example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . \nthere are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . \nas for the question of whether or not \" scream 2 \" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . \n . \n . \nwell , it\'s hard to say . \ni gave the first \" scream \" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up . \n \" scream 2 \" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . \ni\'m not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck . \n',1
'expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . \nroger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . \ni read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . \nthe opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . \nthe landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . \none can almost sense the cold . \nbut the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . \nthis is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . \nthe movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . \nthis chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . \nin the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . \nin a gym bag . ? \naffliction too was set in a snowy landscape . \nit really seems very simple . \njust hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they\'ll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . \nbut the snow melts , and so might several of the character\'s hopes . \nas in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . \nbut doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . \nthe movie\'s biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . \ni have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . \nthe biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . \nthe writer perhaps feels that he doesn\'t have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . \nthis is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book\'s author . \nthe movie is always clear on where it\'s going , and always makes sense . \ni\'m sue a lot was cut , but really i can\'t remember what . \neven a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . \nthe man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . \nturns out . . . \nwell , see the movie . \none should be warned against seeing the trailer . \nit reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . \nbut much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you\'re lucky , you\'ll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie . \n',1
'countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally . \nluckily , movie reviewers aren\'t burdened with such legislation . \notherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer . \nin case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans . \nin any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times . \nthose who don\'t usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery . \nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film . \nlike so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since . \nperhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away . \nor perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before . \nanyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life . \nand it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas\' epic . \nstar wars wasn\'t just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) . \nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema . \nuntil than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . \nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy . \none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\'t like it . \nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s . \ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war . \nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \ncritics who don\'t like the movie , especially those who can\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \nthe others would find the author\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \ngeorge lucas\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \nunfortunately , the same can\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\' superiority over kubrick . \nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \n',1
'when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be \" you too can believe whales can fly \" . \nthen it was going to be \" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly \" . \nthen , it was going to be \" you too can believe wood sprites can fly \" . \nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \nthere\'s a lot of flying going on in this film ! \nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \nis the format effective for the film ? \nwith a few exceptions , yes . \nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\'s fifth symphony . \nit\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \nthough this segment isn\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\'s \" the pines of rome \" . \nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . \nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\'s \" rhapsody in blue \" . \nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \nthere\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \ni won\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\'s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\'s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . \na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \nset to camille saint-saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\'s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer\'s apprentice \" . \nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \nunfortunately , the segment wasn\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\'s \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \ndonald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn\'t make it on the boat . \nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \npowerful stuff . \nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . \nset to igor stravinsky\'s \" the firebird \" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . \ntrees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . \nwhen the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . \nin a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . \nsome amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . \nthe host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin\'s clip is pretty funny . \nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . \npenn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner\'s \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the \'40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . \nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . \nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . \nas i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . \ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . \nthen you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly . \n[g] \n',1
'disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . \nwhile it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . \nfa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it\'s \njust that she doesn\'t quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . \nwhile most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . \nbut there is trouble on the horizon . \nthe evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . \nthe emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . \nthe only male in mulan\'s family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . \nmulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father\'s life . . . by \nsecretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . \nmulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . \nwong , singing : donny osmond ) . \nbut she\'s not alone in her tasks . . . in \ntypical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized \" guardian \" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . \nmuch like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn\'t flow well with the rest of the more serious story . \nsure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . \nthe overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . \nbut , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . \nthe animation is on par with some of disney\'s best . \nthe story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . \nthe musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney\'s recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . \nat least , we\'re only subjected to four of them this time around . \nmulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . \nmost of the killing is off-screen and it\'s all highly depersonalized ( there\'s nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi\'s mom ) . \nthere\'s nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . \nchildren will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . \nit\'s ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . \nif the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . \ninstead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies . \n',1
'scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . \nduring a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . \na few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . \n . \n . \nscream 2 ! \n1996\'s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! \na sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . \nin fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! \nsidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . \nmeanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled \" stab \" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . \nas scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of \" stab \" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . \nthis marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown \" copycat \" sets out to repeat what\'s been done . \n . \n . \nand finish what hasn\'t ! \nof course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . \nthis is in large part due to williamson\'s deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . \nas much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you\'re not bound to complain . \ni will note , however , that the \" whodunit ? \" \ndid wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . \nall the actors outdo themselves here . \nwe\'re not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . \nthe characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . \nwe can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don\'t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . \nthe nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn\'t seem off-kilter from it\'s predecessor . \nit\'s a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . \nwe skip two years , but there doesn\'t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . \nit flows so well that you feel more like you\'re reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) \nthan just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . \nwhile main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2\'s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . \nas i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it\'s precursor . \nthe only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . \nthis doesn\'t mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it\'s sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it\'s own while maintaining it\'s sought-after qualities . \nif ever a film followed it\'s original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . \nscream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . \nit would top off the series quite well , if it weren\'t for the fact that two movies don\'t really make a series . \nit\'s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won\'t appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let\'s hope they can keep up the fantastic work . \nlike they say , don\'t mess with perfection . \n . \n . \nbut when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who\'s gonna listen ? \n',1
'one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise . \n \" spy kids \" certainly did . \nan adventure story aimed primarily at children , the movie is smart , zippy fun . \nthe production neither panders nor talks down to its audience . \nthe brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving . \nbathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence . \nwhat a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics . \nconsider the other pg rated \" family friendly \" movie in theaters now . \n \" see spot run \" has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor . \nbody function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop . \nwhat really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film . \nthe story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process . \nat the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn\'t bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together . \nof course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells . \nsomebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ? \n \" spy kids \" is a welcome antidote to the repellent \" see spot run , \" using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness . \ncarmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino ) . \nmom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children . \nwhat the kids don\'t know is that they are also former spies . \nonce agents from different countries assigned to \" erase \" each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family . \nneedless to say , they get drawn back to the business . \nshortly into their first joint mission , they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) , a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni\'s favorite tv show . \nbut there is evil behind the scenes , as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children . \npapa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him . \nback at home , \" uncle \" felix ( cheech marin ) shows up to reveal mom and dad\'s secret to the kids . \nafter a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them . \nduring the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses . \nthey watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop\'s tv show . \nthey deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms , legs and heads would normally be ( why are the guards so ineffective ? \nbecause they\'re all thumbs ! ) \nthey move from one colorful locale to another , including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from \" star trek . \" \nthe storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either \" mission : impossible \" movie . \ndirector robert rodriguez ( \" from dusk to dawn \" ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes . \na bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family . \nalexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team , squabbling the way kids do , but coming together when it counts . \nantonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes . \neven the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments ?

'screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . \nscreenplay by andrew kevin walker . \ninspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . \ndirected by tim burton . \nstarring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . \nspecial appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . \nsynopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . \ntownspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . \ncute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . \ncomments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . \nbatman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . \nhe\'s done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children\'s movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . \nsleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . \nsleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios\' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international\'s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . \nchristopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . \nthe movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . \none of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . \ni mention these allusions for a reason . \nseasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . \nwith the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . \nnot only does it have a sense of history , but burton\'s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . \nthe film\'s eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . \njohnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving\'s original story and is now an investigator . \ndepp is adequate in his role . \nno more ; no less . \nequally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . \nshe\'s a good witch too . \nhow cute . \none of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . \nthe two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . \nveteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . \nwhile i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . \nyou have to pay attention . \nandrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . \nhe\'s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . \nwalker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn\'t hurt his growing reputation . \nas one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . \nthere\'s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . \nthis is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . \na lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest\'s eyes with her hand . \nhe was obviously upset by the movie\'s intense violence . \nif you\'re looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended . \n',1
'this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . \nwhether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . \nthe main problem was fairly simple : the film\'s climax was unworthy of its build-up . \nsomeone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition . \nnow available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind . \nthe plot is thus . \nwe meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) . \nthe rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine . \nrequiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) . \nbut a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they\'re dealing with , as she memorably puts it , \" aren\'t speaking russian \" . \nmeanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions . \nthis crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . \nthe human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron\'s aliens . \nthe stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . \nand so they should be : cameron\'s technical credentials are well established . \nbut what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis\' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . \nthe abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . \none is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile . \nthe second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film\'s end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war . \nwith the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story\'s climax is now given real weight . \nwhy on earth were they left out of the original ? \nthis reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible . \nso then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that\'s turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . \ni say \" quite \" because some flaws do remain . \nthe most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag . \nnonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron\'s greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound . \n',1
' \" the deep end \" uses a color palette of rich earth tones surrounded by a vast array of blues . \nalluring , attractive blues , but also icy and foreboding . \nafter taking in their beauty , the eye seeks out the reassuring browns and greens , like a tired swimmer searching for the safety of land . \nthe production works that way as well ? it pulls you in initially as a crisp , thoroughly-modern thriller , with clipped exchanges between defiantly non-communicative characters . \nbut the real draw of the film is the submerged humanity of two key players as \" the deep end \" gradually reveals the melodramatic core beneath its ironic candy coating . \nspoiler alert : the following reveals the basic storyline . \ni believe the plot points are incidental , because the real rewards come in exploring the mindset of the main characters , but still , you should proceed at your own risk . \nwith her husband tom , a naval officer , often away at sea , margaret hall ( tilda swinton ) holds down the fort , taking care of the children , beau ( jonathan tucker ) , paige ( tamara hope ) , and dylan ( jordon dorrance ) , while her father-in-law jack ( peter donat ) hovers in the background , always watching . \nthe story opens with margaret leaving the family home in lake tahoe to storm a male strip club in reno . \nit seems that beau , her eldest , is having an affair with darby reese ( josh lucas ) , a disreputable sort 12 years his senior . \nmargaret demands that darby leave her son alone , only to have the man smirk at her and announce he\'ll be glad to steer clear of beau ? for $5000 . \nback at home , she tries to talk about it all with her son , but the kid won\'t even confirm that he\'s gay , let alone discuss the issues she has with his boyfriend . \nhe does , however , get attentive when she reveals darby\'s $5 , 000 offer , even as he maintains his sullen demeanor . \nlate in the evening , darby shows up outside , tossing pebbles at beau\'s window like a schoolchild . \nthe two meet by the water at the boathouse , where something important happens . \ni won\'t reveal what ; suffice to say we become aware of a significant fact that margaret does not . \nall of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie , by the way . \nwithin a day or so , margaret\'s life becomes even more complicated when a suave man named alec goran visnjic ) turns up with an explicit videotape documenting the sex life of beau and darby . \nhe and his associate are willing to destroy the tape , once margaret coughs up $50 , 000 . \noh , what\'s a mother to do ? \nend spoilers \nwritten , directed and produced by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( \" suture \" ) , \" the deep end \" is based on elisabeth sanxay holding\'s 1940\'s novel , \" the blank wall , \" which was also the source of the 1949 film , \" the reckless moment . \" \ni\'ve neither read the book nor seen the movie , but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details . \nin holding\'s story , the \" scandalous \" relationship is between an older man and margaret\'s teen-age daughter . \nswitching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary , and it also raises questions about margaret\'s motives . \nmany reviews of \" the deep end \" describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son , but i wonder . \nconsider this : margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home . \nher husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a larger-than-life figure . \nher father-in-law is constantly present , almost as if he is monitoring for his son . \nand when her husband does call , margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family . \nso is margaret a mother who accepts her son\'s sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him ? \nor is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency , desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea ? \nyou sort it out . \nregardless , the resonance of \" the deep end \" comes from two actors . \ngoran visnjic , best known from the tv drama \" er , \" is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you\'ve seen before . \nhe engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol , chivalry and simmering eroticism . \nbut the star of this show , without a doubt , is the remarkable tilda swinton . \nwatch the shadings , depth , resource , vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her . \ndays after my second viewing of \" the deep end , \" i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains , trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water . \n \" the deep end \" is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it . \n',1
'in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us . \npresident john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson\'s dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in \" thirteen days . \" \none of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called \" missiles of october \" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown . \nthat teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 . \nnow , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller \" no way out \" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america\'s and the world\'s history . \ntaken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o\'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war . \nas o\'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems . \nmeanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment . \nsuddenly , ken\'s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat . \nwhere \" thirteen days \" differs most from \" missiles of october \" is , as expected , in the scope of the project . \nthere is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen . \nit shows as the makers of \" thirteen days \" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation . \nthe cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner . \ncostner\'s o\'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family . \nthis puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america\'s preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know . \nkenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more . \nthe meat of \" thirteen days \" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though . \nthis is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels . \nthe story does not just cover the face-off between the world\'s two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia . \nthe disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . \nthe missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america\'s dignity and world leadership intact . \nwhile the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . \nthis is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . \nwhen the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . \nthe most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . \nthis is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . \nthe ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . \ngreenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . \ninstead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . \nkennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . \ncostner , as ken o\'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . \ncostner plays o\'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . \nthe rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . \nthe rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . \nstanding out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . \nthe filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . \ndylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . \nkevin conway gives his general lemay the right \" bomb them to hell \" attitude . \nalso notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o\'donnell\'s admonition , \" don\' get shot . \" \ntech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . \nit\'s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . \nsolid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . \nthere is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . \nthe special f/x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . \nthe cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . \nhelmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . \ni give \" thirteen days \" an a- . \n',1
'susan granger\'s review of \" hearts in atlantis \" ( castle rock/warner bros . ) \ntiming is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of \" stand by me \" with the mystical power of \" the green mile . \" \nbased on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it\'s set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self-centered mother ( hope davis ) . \nhe\'s devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card . \nknowing he\'s longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers . \nthe story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins\' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive . \nthe only explanation is that he\'s a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now . \nthe production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" hearts in atlantis \" is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis . \n',1
'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \n \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . \nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \nduring their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \nnote : i have not read thompson\'s book . \nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a\' changing \" in the states . \njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \ni couldn\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\'s eating gilbert grape ?

'in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone\'s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . \nwall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . \nstone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . \ncritics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . \ni\'m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . \ni found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone\'s output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . \nstone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . \nthis approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . \nhe directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . \nit\'s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . \ni have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . \nthese guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . \nmore than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . \nthe only possible solution i can muster is its release date . \nand not just the timeliness of the \" greed is good \" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . \nin my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . \nmaybe stone\'s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . \nboiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone\'s piece of crap . \nthey both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room\'s is much more subtle and touching . \nand they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . \nboiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn\'t shove it in our faces . \nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . \nas i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn\'t been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! \nin our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it \" all \" . \nand seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it \" all \" the easy way . \nhe\'s a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . \nben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . \nhis job is to influence trainee\'s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . \nit\'s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they\'re told to dish out to prospective buyers . \naffleck\'s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin\'s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor\'s performance . \naffleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . \nwhen alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . \nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . \nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . \nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . \nthey aren\'t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . \nwe drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . \nas in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . \ni know this story . \nwe all do . \nbut it can work if it\'s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\ director ben younger tells it . \nas a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . \nhis style is sitcom bland . \nbut his writing isn\'t . \nyounger\'s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . \ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . \nthe brokers \\ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . \nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn\'t aware that he is one . \nwith the exception of affleck\'s brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . \nribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . \nhe conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren\'t going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he\'s ferociously cut throat . \nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it\'s just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . \nboiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . \nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth\'s friend and his mentor . \ndiesl shines in his minor role . \nthis week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . \nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80\'s , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70\'s . \nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can\'t have . \nnia long , as the firm\'s secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi\'s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . \nthe two make an oddly likeable couple . \nlong is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . \nat one point he says to her \" i\'m just lookin\' for some chocolate love \" . \nit\'s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . \nunfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . \nthere is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . \nthis is okay when taken in small doses , but younger\'s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . \na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth\'s manipulations have on one of his poor victims . \nit\'s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . \nthat message being , \" greed is bad \" . \nyes it\'s patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven\'t seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . \nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . \nboiler room offers neither extreme . \nit gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . \n',1
'every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he\'s not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . \nnot to mention an expensive one . ) \nsometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . \nwith action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it\'s equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . \ndirected and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . \nwhile the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . \nand boy , did he take that route ! \ni\'d say at about 165 mph or so . . . \nthe film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . \nif you\'ll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically \" hibernated \" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . \nunfortunately , she thought she\'d only be out for a couple of weeks . . . \nonce she\'s returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by \" the company \" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . \nin truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an \" alien advisor \" . \nit seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . \nit doesn\'t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say \" big mistake \" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . \nwhen they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . \nonly one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . \nand soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . \nwhat happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . \ncameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you\'re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . \nwhich features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . \nmany people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . \nwell , they would be wrong , my friends . \nif this film had no \" drama \" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? \nthat\'s right , best actress . \nyou know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . \nin short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . \nthen again , maybe not . \nmovies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it\'s throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . \nso who will be the next king ? \nwell , let\'s wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the highest budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . \ni can\'t wait . \n',1
'jamaica is a hot vacation spot . \nthe exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity . \nand as tourism is unfortunately jamaica\'s biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation . \nlife and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country . \nwhile normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface . \nthe voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid . \nit guides the audience along a tourist\'s journey and the story of the native inhabitants . \ninstead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , \" you don\'t see what happens after you flush the toilet . \" \nthis engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there . \nthis strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film . \nstephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals . \nthis isn\'t just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life . \npeople are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country . \nthe variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not . \nof course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank . \nofficials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica\'s economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word . \nthe next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens . \nadmittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument . \nbut jamaica isn\'t against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief . \nif anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations . \n',1
'it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . \nsomehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . \nset in the 1940\'s , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . \nan orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . \nfiguring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . \nsoon homer is delivering babies like a professional . \nhe refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn\'t behave more responsibly . \nlarch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer \" continues to have such high expectations of people . \" \nsuch is the result of an insulated upbringing . \nthough skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . \nhe finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . \nbefriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . \nthus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut\'s wife ) a willing tutor . \ntobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life\'s questions . . . \nmany of which he was unaware needed to be asked . \nhe demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . \nmichael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . \ncalling them \" princes of maine , kings of new england \" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . \ndelroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( what\'s eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . \nregardless of one\'s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . \nthe title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . \nfiguring the rules didn\'t apply to them since they didn\'t have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . \ndr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . \nthere is a danger in that line of reasoning . \ngod has also given us a set of rules . \nunlike the list posted in the cider house , god\'s rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . \nand yet , many continue to ignore his \" rules \" preferring to make up their own as they go through life . \n \" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . \" \nproverbs 3 : 5 [kjv] \njust as a builder follows a designer\'s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer\'s score , why shouldn\'t we follow the rules of life given to us by life\'s architect for our own blessing ? \n',1
'urban legend surprised me . \nbased on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . \nthankfully , legend rose above it\'s soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . \nyou\'re all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who\'s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody\'s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the \nonly person you didn\'t suspect ! \nhowever , just because legend doesn\'t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can\'t qualify as first-class entertainment . \nit was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i\'ve had at the movies all year . \nthe thing is , i\'m not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . \nmaybe it was the above-par performances by the movie\'s two leads ( jared leto and \" cybil \" actress alicia witt ) . \nor , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks . \nmore likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . \ni don\'t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . \nurban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . \na pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . \none problem , though . \nwould you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? \ni thought not . \npredictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . \nit\'s odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody\'s on the other line . \nnaturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . \nand the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! \na decapitation . \nit turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . \nso who is it this time ? \nthe obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . \na-ha . \nor could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? \nlike all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . \nand it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn\'t suspect . \ni\'m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . \nand this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . \n * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca \n',1
'it is simply amazing how \" the green mile \" developed in its three hour running time . \nbased on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . \nhowever , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . \nfrank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner\'s story in \" the shawshank redemption \" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . \nthrough edgecomb\'s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . \nfrom an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , \" the green mile \" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . \nthe plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . \nthe performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . \nthe ensemble acting in the film is perfect . \nhanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . \nthey are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . \nthey are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . \nthe more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . \nsome particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . \nhutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . \nevery time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . \nit would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . \nrockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . \nas a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . \nthis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . \nthe last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . \nduncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . \nhis desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . \nhis pain creates pain for the viewer . \nhowever , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . \nthe film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at \" the jerry springer show . \" \nthe scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . \nnot only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . \nas the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . \nhis death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . \ngreene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don\'t even see him walk the infamous green mile . \nhowever , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . \nthe speed in \" the green mile \" is perfect . \nif time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . \nthe three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . \n \" the green mile \" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . \nfighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . \nif you survive the first third of \" the green mile \" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment . \n',1
'martin scorsese\'s kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure . \npersonally , i don\'t think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . \nscorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . \nthe set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao . \npolitical art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative . \n',1
'you\'ve probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith\' . \nit\'s a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . \nas youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . \nwhile their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . \nbut tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away . \nnow adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs . \nthe likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi . \non the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad\' . \nin the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory . \neverything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums . \nnow a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again . \nwith these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there\'s bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters . \npredicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith\' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b . \nedward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear\' . \nafter shockingly bitter roles in `american history x\' and , most recently , david fincher\'s vicious `fight club\' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice . \nnot in the least . \nnorton slips into the director\'s chair for the first time with `keeping the faith\' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg . \nweighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut . \nin addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence . \nstiller ( the zipper guy from `there\'s something about mary\' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity . \nelfman\'s perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv\'s `dharma and greg\' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here . \nthe remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob\'s animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice . \n`keeping the faith\' is the perfect date flick . . . \nthough perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general . \nthere is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead . \nonce the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful . \nstiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities . \nwe enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true . \nthis is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements . \nnonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won\'t wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else\'s in the audience . \n`keeping the faith\' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion . \naww , what the hell . \nthe quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith\' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre . \n',1
' \" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . \" \nstarring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong \neight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love . \nneither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough . \nand along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films . \nslim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york . \nwhen the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver . \nhe does not seem particularly out of place . \nin fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home . \nhe brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they\'re american ) --the tokens of his success . \nhe also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) . \nhe loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents\' village . \nwhen he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father . \nall of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening\'s end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl . \nbut eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable . \ndirector mabel cheung ( an autumn\'s tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home . \nslim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language . \nseeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home . \nthe condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic . \non his way to his parent\'s village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man . \nslim and odds-and-ends fall for each other . \nthat\'s predictable . \nthe manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not . \nthe emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma . \nit\'s typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover . \nbut here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot . \nthe fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . \neight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . \nwhen odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , \" it\'s all the same . \nwherever we go , we\'ll be in chinatown , \" and her straightforward statement expresses much . \nthere is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends\' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american . \nboth their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong . \nbut they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . \nsuch is life . \nthe movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . \neverything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . \nslim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . \nthe exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people\'s lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . \nyes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies . \n',1
'it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as \" raising arizona \" and \" the hudsucker proxy , \" made their feature film debut with \" blood simple , \" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . \nit bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens\' recent \" fargo , \" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; \" blood simple \" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . \nthe premise of \" blood simple \" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . \nemmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . \nthings start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . \nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . \nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator\'s eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the \" big picture \" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . \nthis aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . \nthe coens might have done well to title the film \" fear and loathing in texas . \" \nsome have labeled \" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . \nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . \nthat said , \" blood simple \" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . \nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . \nthat said , \" blood simple \" is not exactly flawless . \nfor one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . \nand although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren\'t quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it\'s-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . \nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . \n \" blood simple \" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it\'s a decent movie and it showcases the coens\' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . \ni would firmly recommend it to all \" coen-heads \" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . \n',1
'in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg\'s success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas\' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success . \nlittle did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film . \nin january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . \nin this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don\'t do much but call attention to themselves . \nother than these , the film is exactly the same . \nwhy pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? \nsimply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . \nwe should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven\'t seen it . \nthe plot is basic but in the same way , complex . \nit has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . \nhis mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . \nhe and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker\'s two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . \nskywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . \nthe film is obviously quite star-studded . \nbut how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones\' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? \nit just happened to work out for him . \nthe magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker\'s triumph is symbolized by the audience\'s sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . \n , \n',1
'though it is a fine piece of filmmaking , there\'s something about elizabeth . . . that \nleft me a bit cold , and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films , particularly these days ; i just didn\'t care about the characters . \nto me , the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters ( be they imagined or historical as the case may be ) that the audience gives a hoot about . \nand though elizabeth works well on many levels , it falls short of excellence because of that very reason . \nelizabeth takes place in england in 1554 , as queen mary , half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying . \nbefore she dies , though , she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs . \nas a result , amidst much anger within the council , elizabeth becomes the queen of england . \nthe film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life . \nmuch of the film deals with elizabeth\'s love for lord robert , a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen . \nthere is much ado about her lack of a husband , and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation . \nthe problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece , as love interests are such a character driven element . \ni didn\'t much care about the characters ( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett ) and so i didn\'t have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials . \nthe cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen\'s most loyal advisor , sir francis , and attenborough as a well-meaning but old-fashioned lead council . \nwhy then , you must be asking , do i recommend elizabeth ? \nsimply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer . \nkapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin ( neither of whom i have heard ) create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side . \nthe light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches , cellars and castles in 16th century europe . \neach frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown-out white light from windows . \nthe costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot . \nindeed , elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade , ranking with kundun and braveheart . \nwatch also for the incredibly \" godfather-esque \" mass murder scene . \nit made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films . \n',1

'the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and \" real \" movies . \nconsider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . \ntop-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . \nbased on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story\'s structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . \ntold in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan\'s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . \nthe author is even on record as applauding egoyan\'s changes . \nin the press notes the book\'s author describes the story as \" a parable of lost children . \" \nhe says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . \npicking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of \" the pied piper \" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . \nperiodically throughout the picture , nicole\'s readings are heard in voice-over . \nyou have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . \nthey and the rest of the town\'s children come into harm\'s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . \nand the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . \nalthough the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . \nian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . \nmitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . \nhis mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . \nif this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . \nthe story unfolds slowly and always believably . \neach little aspect has its own fascination . \nas mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . \nhe wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . \nwendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person\'s numerous faults . \nalthough the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . \none of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . \nwell , single parent billy\'s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . \nhis confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . \nthe accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn\'t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . \nalthough the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . \nas the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . \nto round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . \nhis daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . \nfond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . \n ( \" i can help you , \" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \n \" not unless you can raise the dead , \" billy snaps back . \nmitchell\'s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) \nmychael danna\'s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . \nthe cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . \nthe show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . \nstill , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . \ni could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . \nmore than anything , the film is like a master painting . \neach cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . \nwith the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . \nthe sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . \nit is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . \n',1

'set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city . \nhis dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town . \ninstead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead . \ntherefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city . \ndue to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p . knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city . \nhe arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff\'s murder . \nwhen marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong . \nin the end , there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall . \nwith the rumpo\'s past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance ! \nsid james , with an american accent , is perfect as the rumpo kid , a part which suits him down to the ground . \njim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter . \nother regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively . \nbig heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past . \njoan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid . \nhowever , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee\'s performance is rather poor . \nkenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the \'judge\' . \neven so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams\' favourite . \na very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on . \nthe death count is the highest of any carry on film . \nsets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable . \nthe songs that are included in the movie ( the title song and annie\'s song ) are very impressive . \na strange but therefore very interesting carry on film . \nnot the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series . \n',1
'leonardo decaprio ( what\'s eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv\'s my so called life ) star in director baz luhrmann\'s modernized version of william shakespeare\'s classic , romeo & juliet . \nsurrounded by a superb supporting cast , in-cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus-pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danes shine throughout the film . \nthe story starts off at a gas station , where the \" montague boys \" meet the \" capulet boys \" and square off with one another . \nsymbolizing the swords of shakespeare\'s day were their weapons , like the \" rapier-9mm \" or the \" longsword- shotgun . \" \ninstead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old . \nanother great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo\'s best friend . \nmercutio , who in shakespeare\'s novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri-can-american cross-dresser whose violent na-ture , was a definite plus . \nmiriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet\'s nurse , even though she was never given a name . \nshe was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world . \nverona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare\'s version , only slightly changed in luhrmann\'s . \nnow known as verona beach , the capulet\'s ( led by sorvino ) and montague\'s ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties . \nand their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars . \none slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english . \nsub-titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand . \nthis excellent movie poses another prob-lem : what genre is it ? \nromeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories . \nwith the same award-winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , romeo & juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece . \n , \n',1
'capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . \nto end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . \nthe somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone\'s taste . \n , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) \nmore than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . \nthis may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . \nduring world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . \nthis led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . \nwhen the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . \nminimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . \nwhile the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6\% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27\% . \nthe best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . \nthat railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . \nthe best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . \nand just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . \nin the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . \nfilmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . \nthere are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . \ncertainly there was david lean\'s the bridge on the river kwai . \nthere were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . \nthen there were tv series \" a town like alice \" and \" tenko . \" \nlest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . \nit is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . \nthe film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . \nthe story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . \nit turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . \nbeating and torture are commonplace events . \nmen already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . \nhowever , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . \nso goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . \nthis is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . \nthe japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group\'s norms is all that gives a life meaning . \nconformity is purpose . \nbefore the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . \nif this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . \nif the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . \nit is neither . \nit is a stirring and believable account of camp life . \nthe color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . \nthis serves a double purpose for cunningham . \nit gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . \nit also creates a distancing effect . \nthe only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . \nthis is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . \ni rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n',1
'in tim burton\'s `sleepy hollow\' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name . \nhe rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe . \nburton\'s update on washington irving\'s classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow\' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror . \nwriter andrew kevin walker ( `seven\' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine . \nas `sleepy hollow\' opens , we\'re greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton\'s `ed wood\' . \nlandau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider . \nafter two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate . \nlandlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods . \ncrane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) . \nfirst and foremost , `sleepy hollow\' is a fun horror film . \nas with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . \nthe horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors . \nbut why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow\' as much as i did ? \nalthough enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . . \nit was the light comic touch that burton applied . \nthe film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp\'s wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities . \nthis is certainly not the only alteration that\'s been made . \nas the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves . \nthe momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it\'s not an issue we particularly wish to be solved . \nit\'s more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive . \nstill , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton\'s keen eye to capture our attention . \nthe costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it\'s recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) . \nthe supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . \na blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel\'s daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent . \nwalken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton\'s `batman\' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles . \ni suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow\' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy . \nall of this is not to be taken seriously , of course . \n`sleepy hollow\' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children . \nif you\'ve got a decent head on your shoulders , you\'ll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time . \n',1
'in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking . \nthe hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone . \nthe cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble . \nall chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element . \nthe duo must always be completely mismatched . \nthe hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone . \nhowever , that doesn\'t necessarily make for a bad film . \nrush hour is jackie chan\'s first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) . \nproving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before . \nstill , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) . \nthis film takes a familiar theme of east meets west . \njackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted\' to the fbi to help him . \nor , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) . \ndespite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you\'ll spend and hour and forty minutes watching . \njackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches . \nchris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan\'s straight-laced character . \nhowever , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films . \nperfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water\' routine through his character\'s attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences . \nwhen he is in action , however , you\'ll be amused and dazzled . \nstill being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu . \nchris tucker\'s character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous . \nsince he\'s not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west\' ) . \nwhile dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny . \nwhile not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well . \nlee\'s `knowledge\' of american pop culture ( `that\'s the beach boys ! \' ) \nwhen contrasted against carter\'s lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves . \nwhile rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan\'s first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy . \nwith its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film . \nas well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star . \n',1
' ( dimension films , \" scream 2 \" \'s distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film\'s twisty plot . \nthat\'s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there\'s a first ) . ) \n \" the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , \" said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter\'s wes craven thriller \" scream , \" her statement referring to the films of the \" nightmare on elm street \" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general . \nthe comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas . \nbut like it or not , along comes \" scream 2 . \" and believe it or not , it\'s a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood\'s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions . \n \" scream 2 \" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride . \nit\'s been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california . \nthose surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives . \nplucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along . \ntrash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called \" stab . \" \nand dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during \" scream , \" has left his job as a police officer for a while . \nlife is tranquil . . . \nat least for a while . \nseveral sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it\'s to trust no one . \nthus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o\'connell ) , sidney\'s new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale\'s cameraman who\'s not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney\'s sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy\'s good friend and fellow film student . \ncotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother\'s murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? \nlike the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang . \nthis time , it\'s an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of \" stab , \" making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema . \nbefore tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from \" stab \" which turns scream\'s now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear . \n ( \" b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! \" \npinkett yells at the screen . ) \nit\'s funny , creepy stuff ( i don\'t think i\'ll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . \nanother flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . \nthere are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect . \nthere are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . \nit\'s something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original \" scream \" gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . \nit can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . \nit certainly doesn\'t skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson\'s judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) . \nsometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we\'re shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like \" the usual suspects , \" \" aliens \" and \" the empire strikes back . \" \nstill , \" scream 2 \" does so many things right , it\'s petty to quibble . \nits penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all . \nthe attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus . \nand the denouement ( while not as shocking as \" scream \" \'s ) is priceless ; the film\'s final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in \" scream \" with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper . \nall this and a \" scream 3 \" is in the works . \nknowing the series\' tendency for self-reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice . \nmentioning \" scream 2 \" \'ll help them in their argument . \n',1
'at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \nthat\'s true of home alone 2 and i\'d bet money that it\'s true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn\'t get in the way . \nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids\' cruelty . \nkevin\'s patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he\'s going to have to starve . \nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o\'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \non his way up the stairs , he tells her that \" families suck \" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \nit\'s interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \nthey\'re two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \nhe\'s finally rid of his family ! \nlife is a dream come true . \nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother\'s secret box . \nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( \" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener \" ) . \nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn\'t much of an actor . \nstill , we can see that kevin\'s character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as \" santa \" is getting in his car . \nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \nyou turn on the lights and it\'s not so scary anymore . \nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie\'s genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \nit\'s a lot of fun , and it doesn\'t overwhelm the rest of the movie . \non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \njohn williams\' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \nbut it does have its flaws . \nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn\'t act very well . \nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin\'s insight into his character . \nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin\'s life about five times . \ninstead of \" i\'m gonna get that kid \" they say \" i\'m gonna kill that kid . \" \nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \ni\'ll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \ndon\'t let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \n',1

'the most amazing thing about paul cox\'s innocence is how unlike a movie it is . \ni mean that as the highest compliment . \nif most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i\'d want to run and hide . \nthe sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters\' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . \nalong with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . \nthe romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles \" bud \" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . \nthey decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . \ncomplicating matters is andreas\' frail health , and claire\'s longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can\'t understand why he\'s suddenly become obsolete . \nin my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . \njohn , claire\'s husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . \nclaire initially insists she\'s a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . \nandreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . \ncox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . \nit\'s a reminder of andreas and claire\'s past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . \na pall is cast on the whole affair . \na master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . \nin andreas\' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire\'s love . \nwe also get glimpses into john and claire\'s relationship . \nduring a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . \nall that\'s heard is the scraping of forks against plates . \nthe characters are unlike anything i\'ve seen -- they\'re people . \nso many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . \nor they\'re reduced to comedic buffoons . \nordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren\'t sure what the next step is . \nthey do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they\'ve known throughout their adult lives . \nbravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire\'s affair is automatically justified . \nnorris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire\'s love difficult to accept . \nwe feel for him . \nhe\'s a decent man . \nsure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . \nwith so much presented to the audience , it\'s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . \nhowever , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn\'t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon . \n',1
' ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film\'s climax ; the election , of course ) \nwe see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he\'s been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they\'ve demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . \nand yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . \nno matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she\'s the real threat . \nabout to give in , and divulge that she\'s won by only a lone vote , broderick\'s mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy\'s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , \'no\' . \nthe fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . \nshe can\'t go higher than him . \nhe won\'t allow it . \nand what\'s amazing about \" election \" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . \nearly in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . \nit\'s like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers\' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . \nand it\'s amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it\'s happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around \" nice \" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . \nit\'s with mandy barnett\'s \" if you\'ll be the teacher \" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . \nsexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne\'s satire , or its success . \nit also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . \nsatire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . \nit\'s a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( \" drop dead gorgeous \" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . \npayne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . \nwe sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . \nminus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen \" ferris bueller\'s day off \" . \nwhatever . \n',1
'if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it\'s their predictable endings . \nthe devil\'s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . \nunfortunately for the devil\'s advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . \nnevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . \ni don\'t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . \nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . \nthe devil\'s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . \nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . \nhe ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . \nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . \nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . \nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \nhis life seems to be on the rise . \nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\'s real father . \nis it all just a big nightmare ? \nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\'s life ? \nthe devil\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\'t expect . \nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \nif so , the devil\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \ni went into the devil\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\'t like the ending ? ) . \nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \nthe devil\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \neverything occurs from his perspective . \nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \ni don\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \nit earned its r rating for a reason . \nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \nthis film really isn\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \ni don\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \nsomething the devil\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \nthe cast of the devil\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\'t expect . \nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \ni have never seen him more believable to date . \nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\'s past . \nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \nthe devil\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \n',1
'now that \" boogie nights \" has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn\'t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . \nthe latest art house interpretation is whit stillman\'s \" the last days of disco . \" \nstillman , who made \" metropolitan \" and \" barcelona \" using some of the same actors , uses disco\'s final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . \nthe young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don\'t call them yuppies ! ) \nmen and women of \" the last days of disco \" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . \nhere they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . \nif talk is cheap , \" the last days of disco \" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . \nwhat makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of \" the lady and the tramp \" ) . \nna ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . \ncharlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , \" like a kindergarten teacher . \" \nthe two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . \nhere they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . \ndes ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club\'s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . \ndes has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he\'s gay . \nwhether it\'s true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . \ncharlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . \njimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of \" barcelona \" ? ) . \njosh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , \" book this clown ! \" \nand robert sean leonard plays another one of alice\'s revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . \nany film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . \nin fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . \nwhile the eschewing of \" ferocious pairing \" is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the \" preferred \" dynamics of social group interaction . \nmore mature than stillman\'s previous two films , \" the last days of disco \" is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . \nit\'s a movie you should definitely get on down to . \n',1
'i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . \nit contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . \nit is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) . \none of the bad guys was a surprise . \nthe pace is fast enough , there are some \" action \" scenes . \ni think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick . \njulia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together . \ni really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair ! \nher hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . \nshe could use some highlights . \nthey both do fine with their roles : he\'s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she\'s a hotshot \" cub \" reporter with the chicago globe . \nthey have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie . \ni like the one story focus . \nother actors include charles martin smith as roberts\' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte\'s coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman . \nbasically this movie is reasonably fun . \nthere is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery . \nit is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously . \ni do give successful comedy high marks . \n',1

'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nduring the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . \noh , he\'s been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . \nit\'s been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino\'s new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . \nthings aren\'t going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . \nshe\'s 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( \" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren\'t worth a damn \" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she\'s just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . \nthe loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he\'s soon out to silence jackie brown . \nmeanwhile , the authorities\' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . \nonly through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . \nalthough jackie brown marks mr . tarantino\'s first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel \" rum punch \" ) , there\'s no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . \nwhile he\'s adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character\'s now black . \nin terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . \nthe opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . \nthe timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . \nof course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it\'s perhaps the most tender scene of the year . \ntenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? \nsure , there\'ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino\'s films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . \nthese staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what\'s new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . \nthis effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he\'s the real deal . \nthis new aspect of mr . tarantino\'s storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . \nmr . forster\'s nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . \nmuch press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta\'s then-sagging career . \nas it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film\'s title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . \ni do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she\'s been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton\'s mars attacks ! \nand larry cohen\'s original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) \nof course , it\'s true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . \nwhile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . \nand while the film\'s narrative doesn\'t really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it\'s filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn\'t an unengaging moment . \nwith an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it\'ll be interesting to see what he tries next . \n',1
'the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . \ngeez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! \nsorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . \nthe pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in \" absolutely fabulous \" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . \nneedless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder\'s legs ! \nbut despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i\'ve now seen the film a couple of times now , that \" hobbling \" scene was no less disturbing ! \ni\'m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! \nthat may be the most memorable scene , but it\'s certainly not the only worth watching . \nstephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . \nit\'s a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . \nrescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer\'s \" number one fan \" , he soon becomes her prisoner . \nboth the script and kathy bates\' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . \nbates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . \nat times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she\'s a rather tragic character , and more often than not she\'s just damned scary ! \nthis is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . \nit\'s an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it\'s basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it\'s a remarkable piece of cinema . \nthere are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner\'s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . \noh , i haven\'t really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who\'s a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . \nbut , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . \nalong with the pig , of course ! \nanyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . \nthere\'s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . \nhe succeeds , but . . . she \nknocks the glass over ! \ni bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! \nin the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \" d\'oh ! ! \" \nother nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . \nwe cut to annie in her car - she\'s on her way home . . . he \nrealises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut \nto the car again , she\'s getting near . . . will he make it ? \nok , so these sequences aren\'t exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! \nboy , do they work ! \nif a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it\'s doing something right ! \nof course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \" hobbling \" ! \nannie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she\'s going to stop him once and for all . \ncue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! \nnasty . \nit all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! \nand then we\'re given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i\'ve ever seen . \nshe gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won\'t die ! \nsheldon isn\'t in terribly good shape either . \nif it weren\'t so gorey it would almost be laughable . \nbut it\'s a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . \nmisery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . \nthe directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . \nwonderful stuff . \n ?

'the latest epos from lars is a blast , although a rather moody one . \nthis lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something . \nthe church ( calvinistic ) is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower , they are considered being too unrestrained . \nin these surroundings we find the to-be-weds jan and bess , played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson . \njan is on leave from the oilrig and bess . . \nis just bess , a bit naive and innocent ( in every aspect of the word ) , at first . \nat the wedding party we are told an anecdote , illustrating her infinite kindness , she once lend a bike to an stranger , her best friends bike however . \nbut bess is suffering in this scary religious society . \nwe soon take part in a funeral where a man , fallen off the orthodox path , is laid to rest while doomed to hell . \nwomen are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church . \nwhen the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend , almost manic , that her friends try to calm her down a bit . \nthe time has come when jan is to return to the rig , bess is falling into the darkness of depression , her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves . \nshe can\'t stand the thought of life without her husband . \nwe witness her dialogues with god ( she speaks both parts , paranoia ? ) \nconvincing god to return jan from the oilrig , and her prayers are heard . \nan accident on the rig bring him back , paralysed from the neck and down . \nnow he can\'t satisfy her need for physical love , he try to persuade her into finding a lover , with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail . \nat first she resist , but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply . \nimagine what this is doing to the poor girl ? \nthe story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others . \nthe use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre . \nthe incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant , though a bit too gloomy for my taste . \ni would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) . \nemily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances , this must be the reason for giving it the \" grand prix du jury \" in cannes this year ( although we had hoped for the \" palme d\'or \" ) . \nthe screenplay is now available in print , the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july , just in time for the danish premiere . \n',1
'synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . \nbobby\'s world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . \nthen one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby\'s house . \nted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . \nas the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted\'s great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . \nreview : a small but enchanting movie , \" hearts in atlantis \" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , \" stand by me \" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . \n \" hearts \" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . \nunlike \" stand by me \" , there is a supernatural element to \" hearts \" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . \nlike \" stand by me \" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . \nyelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . \nmore splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in \" along came a spider \" and who is simply radiant here as carol . \nand then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . \nless successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . \ni also found it odd that bobby and carol\'s other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie\'s flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . \nbut hicks\' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie\'s general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience . \n',1

'this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday . \njon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin . \nas such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him . \nhe has become an unquestioning weapon . \nhe is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . \nbut even assassins have innocent pasts . \nhe runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school . \ncomplicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . \na big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin . \ncalder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequently seen in the us . \nhe was seen in the world is not enough . \nhere he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years . \nhe is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake . \nhis lair is underground , apparently in a sewer , where he lives like the king of sewer rats . \nit is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet\'s life . \npaul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin\'s lair , he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness . \nby using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world . \nthis is a world that is cold and unfriendly . \nsorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see . \nthis is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach . \nwe see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that . \nthe screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross , but it is sarossy\'s film all the way . \nit creates indelible images of evil . \ni rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n ( i do hope they do not use the tagline \" don\'t mess with mr . in-between . \" ) \n',1
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \neast meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney\'s parade of annual animated feature films . \nan odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . \nthough not for lack of trying . \nin many respects , mulan is among disney\'s most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . \nthe violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child\'s discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan\'s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? \nin an instant , idealistic mulan\'s innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . \nthe film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family\'s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . \ndipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney\'s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film\'s vocal work , there\'s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . \nwhile the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can\'t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it\'s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . \nthe film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it\'s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan\'s land . \nat its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . \nas such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . \nscenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan\'s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . \nmulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine\'s character-defining opening half-hour . \nit\'s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . \noff to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . \nthey\'re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . \nat training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . \neverybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . \nthe romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story\'s neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . \nanother staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . \ncomposed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i\'ll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . \nonly \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre\'s most wondrously pure voices . \nnonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . \nwhile the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they\'re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . \nbriskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . \n',1
'apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . \ndirector ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \nif they ever reach it . \ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate\' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \nyou should enjoy it . \n',1
' \" the tailor of panama \" is a different kind of spy movie . \ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \nharry claims to be a transplant from britain\'s renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle\'s shop in an insurance scam . \nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \nosnard offers harry a way out . \nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \nharry\'s little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \nosnard turns in reports about the \" silent opposition , \" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \nharold pinter is amusing as harry\'s uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \nthe metropolis , described by one character as \" casablanca without heroes \" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \n \" the tailor of panama \" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . \n',1
'before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . \nit is the latest entry in this decade\'s dubious revival of the \'70s disaster film , and the first of two \" the sky is falling \" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july\'s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . \nits tagline , \" oceans rise . \ncities fall . \nhope survives \" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( \" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . \nis together \" ) , but it\'s every bit as treacly . \nthe opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . \nthe cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening \" roll call , \" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . \nthe most prominent of the \" personal \" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . \nwhat is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc\'s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film\'s ostensible main character . \nin the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . \nthe initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante\'s peak , but there\'s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . \nshe won an emmy for her helming work on nbc\'s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . \nthe challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . \nhaving passed the \" er challenge \" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin\'s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . \nas the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . \nthere\'s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . \nsituations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny\'s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon \" fish \" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . \nthe latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . \nalthough its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the \'90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn\'t as deep as hoped . \n',1
'felix ( sami bouajila , \" the siege \" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france . \nwhen he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in \" the adventures of felix . \" \nwriters/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy \" jeanne and the perfect guy , \" embracing that typically american genre . \ntheir second effort , \" the adventures of felix , \" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself . \nfelix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends . \nwhen he goes through his late mother\'s papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away . \nfelix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of \" cocktails \" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot . \nhe refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny . \nalong the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations . \non the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police . \nfollowing this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family . \nhis journey brings him to rouen , and the film\'s first title section , \" my little brother , \" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix . \nthey steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on . \nhe next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled \" my grandmother , \" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to . \nshe wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father . \nin the weakest chapter of felix\'s road trip , titled \" my cousin , \" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles . \nhe next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled \" my sister . \" \nhe is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would . \non the final leg of the journey titled \" my father , \" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix\'s kite , just like a father and son . \n \" the adventures of felix \" has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery . \nfirst and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix . \nhe is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of \" cocktails , \" and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself . \nas he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally . \nbouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen . \nthe cast of characters making up felix\'s new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way . \npatachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix . \nariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had . \nonly the \" cousin \" chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix\'s \" family . \" \n \" the adventures of felix \" does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man\'s journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning . \nit helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech\'s crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside . \ni give it a b+ . \n',1
'in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . \nthis ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . \nshe was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . \nfinally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . \nto get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life\'s savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . \njack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . \nrose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . \nthus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . \nthis movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . \nthe movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100\% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . \nnow the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . \nit serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . \nthis movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . \nthe story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . \nmovies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . \nthe attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . \nthe whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . \npart of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . \nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . \nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . \nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren\'t acting but are actually the characters in the movie . \nthe casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . \none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . \nyes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . \nhow is the titanic a character ? \nyou ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . \nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . \nmr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . \nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . \nnow , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . \nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . \nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . \nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . \nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . \nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . \nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . \nthe historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . \nthe method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . \nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . \nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . \nif you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! \nit might not be the best movie in the world . . \nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . \nduring none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie . \n',1

'a common complaint amongst film critics is \" why aren\'t there more literate scripts available ? \" \nquiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn\'t dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content . \npaul attanasio\'s script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors . \nthe film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g . \na \'58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed . \ndeft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script . \nredford departs from the usually overlight , \" cable tv quality \" sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces . \nquiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years . \nalthough i was only 4 years old when the \" twenty one \" scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford\'s almost tangible palette . \nfrom plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without \" disposable income , \" before the manifestation of its american dream . \nthe film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from \" the good life , \" to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father\'s fame . \nthough the 50s audience that is \" rocked \" by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding . \ncharles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day . \nthe tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf . \nat the film\'s end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff . \nlike the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this \" mirror \" may reflect an image we\'re not all that comfortable with . \n',1
'magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft . \nat nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film . \nit not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions . \nit is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking . \nit\'s also a movie that will polarize its viewers . \ndirector paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn\'t let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax . \nthe character\'s make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives . \nthere is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose \" search and destroy \" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants . \nthere is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son . \nthere is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public . \nand there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process . \ngiven equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) . \na materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) . \nhovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair . \nit is not a pleasant movie . \nthere is not one bad note in the acting . \nit is affecting and layered and wonderful . \nthere is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films . \nthen he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene . \nwalters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing . \nrobards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion\'s roar when he speaks . \ndirector anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote . \nthe problem is that he stays on them too long . \njulianne moore\'s character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it . \nafter a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture . \nquite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around . \nand just what is the theme ? \nalienation ? \nhopelessness ? \nanderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn\'t make it easy . \nthe film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events . \nit\'s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come . \nat times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time . \nother times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening . \nanderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film ! \nwhat\'s surprising is that it mostly works . \nif you have doubts about anderson\'s intentions , i\'ll ask you to pay attention to the final frame . \ndespite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man\'s capacity for hope and attempts at redemption . \ndespite magnolia\'s needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts . \nthis is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling . \nmy rating : a bulleye . \n ( stars ) \na side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann . \nher lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful . \nwhen she sings \" save me \" at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as \" wise up \" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives . \n',1
'the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is . \nhe wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film . \ni think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it\'s popularity or it\'s ability to scare the wits out of people . \ni think i have seen \'halloween\' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen . \ni own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe . \nin other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film . \nit has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good . \nit also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan . \nsince i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what ! \ni did and man to me it\'s the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film . \nno words can describe the dvd . \nin \'halloween\' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 . \nnow in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis . \nthe person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut . \nwhy is he stalking her ? \ncheck out halloween ii it explains it all . \non this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive . \nthe whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk . \nnick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did . \nwhat john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style . \nthe movie is flawless if not perfect . \nno other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will . \n\'halloween\' will be like \'psycho\' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later . \ni just hope someday \'halloween\' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition . \n\'halloween\' isn\'t just another slice-and-dice horror flick , it\'s an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made . \nsee \'halloween\' and be scared . . . . then \nwatch it again ! \nreviewed by brandon herring october 7 , 1999 . \n',1

oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , \nit\'s about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement . \nwith this and \" crimson tide , \" he\'s created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart . \nthat film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant . \n \" enemy of the state \" is the same way : it\'s engrossing for its entire running time , and it\'s scary the way that it shows a man\'s decent into kafkaism , but it\'s too technical . \nit\'s too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . \nit casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he\'s charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . \ni hate to do this , but last year\'s film \" the game \" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . \nthe result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . \nnot that i want every kafkaesque film to be \" the game \" ( this year\'s \" the spanish prisoner \" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn\'t . \nwill smith\'s character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect . \nhe had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . \nhe has a kid , and he\'s raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one . \nso he generally doesn\'t have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering \" id4 \" / \" men in black \" territory . \nhe\'s a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of \" six degrees of separation \" for proof of this , not that he isn\'t great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities . \nsmith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) . \nthe government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it . \nas smith\'s plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet . \nthese guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they\'re , well , fascinating : they\'re doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn\'t view them as such , and they almost become our friends . \nwe like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn\'t automatically judge them as the villains . \nthey\'re also scary because we get the idea that they\'re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . \nit\'s as if they\'re obsessed with their jobs , not because they\'re evil , but because , hey , it\'s a fun job , and no one else can do it like them . \nunfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that \" the game \" was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on . \nsure , you\'re chilled , but you\'re not exacty freaked out by what\'s going on . \nbut what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked . \nhe\'s a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : \" days of thunder \" ) , but the reason he\'s not great is because he\'s too technical and calculated . \nhis shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they\'re always making sure you\'re paying attention . \nthis is incredibly annoying , and it reduces \" enemy of the state \" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . \ndespite never actually becoming great , it\'s never actually boring and it\'s always intriguing . \nwatching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith\'s likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . \nadd the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you\'ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith\'s plight without a minute\'s worth of boredom . \n',1
'the postman delivers but not first class \nthe postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \n[warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner . \neven worse , i thought that \" waterworld \" was watchable . \nread the following with those particular grains of salt . ] \nit\'s the year 2013 and things have fallen apart . \ndue to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms . \nalthough this is the future , it looks like a western . \nas the film opens , kevin costner ( his character\'s name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company . \ngiving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . \nrunning into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) . \nthe rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the \" clan \" \nafter a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes . \ntaking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either . \nonce he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the \" restored congress of the united states of america \" . \nthis scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants . \nfood and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile . \nshortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item . \nalthough the postman knows he\'s running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids\' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . \nthe revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists\' tyranny . \nthe postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . \nalthough the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . \nit\'s derivitive of costner\'s own \" waterworld \" and clint eastwood westerns . \nthere\'s little here that we haven\'t seen dozens of times before . \nthe film is often down-right corny . \na scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality . \nthe film\'s final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . \ndespite the film\'s excessive three hour length , several things are never explained . \nwhat was the war about ? \nhow did civilization change so rapidly ? \neveryone has horses : where did all they come from ? \nthe \" law of eights \" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? \nare we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn\'t made their way west to help or conquer ? \nthere is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn\'t appear to make sense . \nthe tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities . \nthe evil army is called \" holnists \" which sounds coincidentally like the new age \" holism \" , but why ? \nis it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ? \nwhy is the general named \" bethlehem \" ? \nthere seems to be some reason for that , but what ? \nsometimes the movie feels like a joke . \nan army of postal workers armed with guns ? \nconsidering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . \nit\'s even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . \ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it\'s asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film\'s nationalism . \neven with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have . \nit\'s doubtful that \" the postman \" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time . \nbesides we\'re all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug . \n ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the \" michael redman \" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him . \nperhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner\'s postal service . ) \n',1
'in `enemy at the gates\' , jude law is a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov ( joseph fiennes ) who uses him in a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of stalingrad . \nit\'s world war ii , and the russian-german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland . \nlaw\'s vassili is the russian\'s top pawn to victory . \nlots of war stuff happens . \nan older , german version of jude\'s character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings . \nhe\'s equally talented , and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other . \nthey constantly switch roles , as the war fades far into the background . \nthe cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov \nthe set-up is decent , and so are the production values . \nboasting a wide range of grimy locales , greasy hair , and tattered costumes , the art direction prospers . \nthe actors , however , suffer the problem matt damon had in `saving private ryan\' . \neither their eyes , teeth , skin , or a combination of other features looked too white and clean . \nwith dirt and blood all around , the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action . \nthat said , the players are mostly good in their roles , although i don\'t think ed harris was really trying . \nmaybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one-notedom . \nwhile the film is technically about snipers , there are far too many predictable sniping scenes . \ndirector jean-jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting , but after about the sixth time , in which we realize that jude is not going to die , it\'s relatively pointless . \nwe get that he\'s talented , okay , let\'s move on . \nthat\'s the problem with `enemy at the gates\' ; it just doesn\'t know when to stop . \nwitness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere . \nreestablishing his title as the most beautiful ( and often talented ) man on film , jude law carries the movie . \nwithout him , this costly production would have gone into the ground . \nthe story and acting are of good quality , but there\'s never a sense of authenticity or reality . \nsomething about this war movie is undeniably modern , and it loses its feeling . \nstrange enough , the screenplay is based on the true story of a real russian sniper . \n',1
'dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . \nshe , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . \nshe writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . \nshe+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . \ntotally trustworthy , right ? \nnot a chance . \nonce home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . \none of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . \nshortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . \ndays go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . \nthrough a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . \nthis means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . \nfilms like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . \nit is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . \nit does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . \nand yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . \nthe focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . \nthe most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . \ndora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . \nbut neither side is trivialized . \nshe even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . \nfernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . \nhe , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . \nhe is a natural , and never once grating . \nsend a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . \n',1
'of all the films i\'ve come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many \" laugh-out-loud \" moments . \ni\'m not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes . \nand i think i\'m the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny . \nusually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign . \nwaiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it\'s 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event . \nthe play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this \" mockumentary \" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success . \nteaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o\'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others . \neverybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out . \nthese characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can\'t help but love them , as pathetic as they really are . \nalthough levy stands out , guest , willard , o\'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances ! \nif there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it . \nsome humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros . \nas delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous . \nthankfully , just as your about to say \" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom \" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes . \nlike a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) . \nlike i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach . \nyou can\'t really watch these people and not think they\'re real people ! \neven they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don\'t feel staged at all , you feel like you\'re watching a real , albeit funny , documentary . \nand even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful ! \nas a word of note , despite it\'s \" r \" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean . \nthis rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words . \neven if that really bothers you , let me say that it\'s not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way . \nit\'s actually quite humorous and tastefully done ! \nit might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman . \nit\'s silly humor , but it\'s also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you\'re not insulted by it . \nit\'s always really nice to see a comedy that isn\'t all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones ! \ni\'d recommend seeing it ! \n',1
'here\'s a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler\'s list is to jurassic park . \nin 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler\'s list as the director\'s \" penance \" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . \nnow , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . \nonce again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . \nnow , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . \nthat film is amistad . \nalthough not as masterful as schindler\'s list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . \nthematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . \nwatching schindler\'s list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . \nspielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . \naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . \namistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . \nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that\'s not a surprise . \nhowever , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . \nseveral , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film\'s dramatic force . \non the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . \none stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . \nled by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . \nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . \nthey are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states\' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . \nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . \nthe first men to come to the africans\' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . \nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . \naided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . \nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwin\'s cause . \ncurrent president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . \nat its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . \ncinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . \nhe is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . \neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . \nthey are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie\'s success . \nto amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans\' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man\'s seemingly-strange \" rituals \" . \nthe larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . \nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as \" sub-human , \" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . \nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . \nin a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . \namistad\'s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . \nfour claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . \nbaldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . \neven though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . \naside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . \nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his \" pretty boy \" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . \nlikewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than \" abolitionists . \" \nnigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . \nfinally , there\'s anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . \nhopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . \nhis ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . \none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler\'s list is this film\'s lack of a well-defined human villain . \nschindler\'s list had ralph fiennes\' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . \nthere is no such figure in amistad . \nthe villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . \nit is to spielberg\'s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . \namistad\'s trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . \nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . \nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . \nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg\'s rousing , substantive film leading

'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \ni\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \nit\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \nit\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \nthankfully the film doesn\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \nhe\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\'s easy to sympathize with him . \nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \nthe resonance to donnie\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\'t always seem to have much meaning . \nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\'s never a and the family is suffering . \nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \na climax of sorts does occur , but there\'s little feeling of a payoff . \nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \nit may be routine , but it\'s good , and that\'s respectful . \n',1
'ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy\'s head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny\'s main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \nduvall\'s portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as \'driven\' in getting the project underway . \nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \non the other hand , the apostle\'s main strength - - duvall\'s preaching - - is also what limits the apostle\'s target audience . \nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \n',1
'playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare\'s works . \nthey also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn\'t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? \nstoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . \nand , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . \nshakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . \nit\'s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . \nit could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you\'ve ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it\'s likely that you\'ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . \njoseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he\'s a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life\'s more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . \nhe\'s commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . \nshakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . \nhe begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . \nthis all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) . \nshakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo . \nhe discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . \nbut she continues to act because she loves shakespeare\'s writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . \nshakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . \ni was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he\'s clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . \nhe practically overflows with passion in every scene . \nfiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i\'ve seen her in . \nthe two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . \nof course , it doesn\'t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . \nstoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . \nthe first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . \none of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . \ndirector john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . \ni\'m going to have to see the movie again ; i\'m certain there are numerous references that i missed . \nin fact , i doubt it\'s possible to gather everything with just one viewing . \nstoppard is a master of detail : you\'ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . \nthere\'s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe\'s mysterious death in a pub . \nthere\'s also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . \n \" there\'s no dog in this play ? \" \n \" no ! \nno dog ! \" \nthe ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year . \ngeoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . \nben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow\'s ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) . \ncolin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful . \njudi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words . \nmy single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . \nthe story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . \nbut my quibbling is not important . \nwhat is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced . \nshakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it\'s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync . \nit\'s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare\'s work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior . \ni admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . \nnot just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it . \n',1
'with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall\'s life is rife with complications . \nand with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent . \nbut margaret\'s hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated . \nher teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university\'s music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd . \nhis mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau . \n \" stay away from my son \" margaret warns darby reese . \nher words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse . \nthere are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight . \nthe next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese\'s lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest . \nwith her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard . \nbut margaret\'s life is about to get a lot more complicated . \nsoon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman\'s line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova . \nalek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o\'clock the next day . \nbut margaret\'s life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected . \nbased on elisabeth sanxay holding\'s novel \" the blank wall , \" \" the deep end \" is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( \" suture \" ) . \nit makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese . \nthe film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel . \nbut it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton . \nswinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman\'s films ( \" caravaggio , \" \" edward ii , \" \" the last of england \" ) , plays margaret hall in \" the deep end \" and , like charlotte rampling in this year\'s \" under the sand , \" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance . \nmargaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being . \nthe role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities . \nmany can relate to that , of course ; it\'s the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one\'s son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors . \nthe end is deep all right , and there isn\'t a single shallow moment in tilda swinton\'s canon . \n',1
'produced by robert lantos & stephen j . roth \ndirected by douglas williams \nmpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical-gross-outs , and sexual content , i\'d put it at pg ) \nthough made in canada , \" overdrawn at the memory bank \" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production . \nusing , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you\'re twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked . \nraul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority . \ncaught watching \" casablanca \" on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to \" doppling \" rehabilitation--he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon . \n ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody\'s guess . ) \nas it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy\'s prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it . \nas time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on . . . while \nfingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there\'s no better way to hack the system than from the inside . \nduring the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings . \nover the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance . \ngiven that \" casablanca \" is fingal\'s favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to \" casablanca \" . \nin fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called \" the place \" . \njulia\'s portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the \" schweethaat \" -spouting parody seen in cartoons . \nnegin\'s peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i\'ve ever seen who wasn\'t the real thing . \nthe two of them , as characters created by fingal\'s imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system . \nthose aren\'t the only casablanca characters to put in appearances . \nthe sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around . . . as \" the fat man \" , the alternate aspect of the film\'s main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c . moore ) . \nwhile fingal\'s body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system . . . with \nless than salutory results . \nit\'s interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition . \nwords like \" dopple \" , \" psychist \" , \" computech \" , \" cinema \" , and \" reconst \" are apparently in common use . \nand while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past\'s idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of \" virtual reality \" today . \nas cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it\'s definitely recommended viewing . \nthe special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low-to-medium-budget television . \nthe music is completely electronic-synthesized , which fits the low budget but isn\'t really out of keeping with the genre . \nhowever , the writing quite makes up for it . \nthere are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in-jokes that one needs to have seen \" casablanca \" to appreciate properly . \nall in all , i give \" overdrawn at the memory bank \" a . \n',1
'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \nbut the right stuff film isn\'t even fiction . \nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \nin one of critics\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \nshepard\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\' wives . \nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\'s superb direction . \nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \nin that setting , it\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \nfilm also lacks proper closure . \non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\'s america . \nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \ntime has passed ; now we don\'t see astronauts as heroes . \nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \n',1
'a miracle of filmmaking , \" some like it hot \" is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists . \nit is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilder\'s career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make . \njerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves . \none night , as they\'re playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided . \nas it turns out , the owner , spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e . stone ) . \nseveral weeks later , on valentine\'s day , jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage . \neager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid . \nthe only catch . . its a girls band . \nso josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon ) , make their way onto the train and go to florida . \non the way there , they meet sugar kane ( monroe ) , a bombshell singer who is looking for love . \njerry and joe immediately fall for the singer , but there\'s two problems : 1 ) they\'re in drag , and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e . brown ) falls madly in love with daphne . \nwhat follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the \" italian opera lovers festival \" . \ntony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar . \nmarilyn monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity . \nthe scenes , however , are all stolen by either brown or lemmon . \nlemmon is hysterical as daphne . \ncast as the less rational one , lemmon\'s performance is ridiculously crazy , it is disorder in the style all billy wilder\'s . \nbrown is particularly hilarious as osgood , as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony . \nhe manages to use lemmon\'s ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire . \nevery set-piece is flawless , as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly , and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture . \nwilder\'s script is stunning , as he carefully combines gangsters , cross-dressing , romance , sex , music , gender roles , and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness . \nwilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria , so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece , the final line of this absolutely incredible film . \nwilder\'s is dead wrong when he says nobody\'s perfect : billy wilder is , especially when he makes something this disastrously funny . \nnobody\'s perfect but billy wilder . \n',1
'ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start . \na romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ? \nwith a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ? \nyuck . \nbut it\'s not really too bad . \nit has a lot working against it , for me at least . \nin addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it . \nit does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable . \njust think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip . \nthrough a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another\'s way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity . \nin fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love . \nthe only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples . \nso this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman\'s model for this film ) . \nwill they get fired from their yuppie jobs ? \nwill they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ? \nwill pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren\'t they all ? ) ? \nwill they finally kiss ? \nwell , what do you expect ? \nbut there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film . \npfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show . \none word of caution , though . \nthis film is being billed in some places as a \" family \" movie . \ndon\'t let that stop you . \nhowever , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move . \nafter all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions . \nall in all , a good , non-offensive date movie . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n',1
'stendhal\'s syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . \ngrim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy\'s master of the horror thriller dario argento . \nboasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . \nit follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980\'s . \nbased on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento\'s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . \nvisiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . \nat the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . \nposing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . \na gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento\'s often lumpy narratives . \nthe stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . \nit is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character\'s psychological disintegration . \nthe script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . \nbut as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . \nargento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . \neffects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . \nthe film\'s opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . \nproof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world\'s most exhilarating filmmakers . \nthe cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . \nasia argento\'s performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . \nit\'s a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . \nthomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna\'s work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . \nbut perhaps the stendhal syndrome\'s single most striking element is ennio morricone\'s soundtrack . \nactive since the 1960\'s , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . \nit\'s mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . \nit\'s been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . \nthis is a long welcome reunion . \nif the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn\'t quite reach a completely satisfying climax . \nbut by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento\'s career . \n * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . \ndubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web . \n',1
'i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \n\'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation\' , the headlines read . \nintrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . \neven though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn\'t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . \nonly now do i see the error of my ways . \nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . \nrather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . \nroberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . \nthrough the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . \nemploying the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . \nlife treats them well until hitler\'s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son\'s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . \ngranted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan\'s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . \nsomehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it\'s gravely serious subject . \nso , we\'ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . \nbut , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . \nthe film , despite critic\'s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . \nsome have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man\'s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . \nthe film\'s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . \nessentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . \nhowever , i am not denying the movie\'s greatness . \nbelieve me , it\'s fantastic . \ni\'m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . \nbut perhaps i\'m reading more into the movie than is really there . \nmaybe the film\'s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . \nin fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it . \n',1
'i guess it\'s a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating \" comedy \" of chris tucker . \ni\'m a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium , and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick , but show off his comic timing as well . \nit would have worked better if he was the only name above the title . \nthe plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects . \nthis time around , the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan ( john lone ) , who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states ( i\'m still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that : is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones ? ) . \nthe only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns . \nof course , it\'s up to hong kong detective lee ( chan ) and trash-talking lapd detective james carter ( tucker ) to take the bad guys out and the authorities , to the extent that they even exist , stay out of their way . \nrush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it\'s carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out . \ni guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan . \nhe refuses to shut up . \nnot only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head , but his jokes just aren\'t funny , a pathetic mixture of sub-par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny . \ni realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates , but didn\'t anyone realize how irritating tucker\'s incessant ranting and raving was ? \nif this is all the comedian has to offer then i don\'t care to see any more of his films . \nfortunately , chan makes for a marvelous straight man , and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely . \nit\'s not often that one actor can so completely save a movie , but there is no other name for what he does ; whenever he\'s on screen , rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking , often hilarious , life . \nmuch of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a \" player , \" but who cares ? \ni can think of few high concepts that are funnier . \nthe movie ends with outtakes that , as usual , show that chan isn\'t perfect , and that it does , indeed , take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless . \nchris tucker botches some lines as well , and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie . \na lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn\'t very different from its predecessor in tone or style . \nbut i liked the original , and i like the sequel , though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it . \ndirector brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) . \nit\'s not great jackie chan , but it\'s jackie chan , and that\'s enough . \nup next : jay and silent bob strike back \n',1
'seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic\'s pass . \n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don\'t want their kids to see . \nit\'s not that it\'s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it\'s a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \nmike\'s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \nhe never sounds like he\'s reading from a script , nor that he\'s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn\'t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike\'s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \nit\'s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \ntechnically , the plot isn\'t unlike many children\'s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid\'s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he\'s dealt and works with them . \nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don\'t ( i . e . \nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything\'s a battle against the cards destiny deals . \none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \nmatt\'s good at gambling but he\'s also got potential to be a great lawyer . \nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there\'s stability but not much risk involved . \ncan someone who\'s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \neverything is told from mike\'s perspective , but we\'re finally able to recognize some things on our own . \nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \n',1
'you\'ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . \nthe title is generic . \nit\'s meaningless . \nand i can\'t believe it\'s good business . \nwhen you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? \nyuck . \nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i\'ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it\'s not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \nhis track record isn\'t as solid as schwarzenegger\'s , but he\'s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong\'s premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo\'s radically different director\'s cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo\'s more operatic offerings . \nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo\'s subsequent broken arrow . \nhere\'s the rundown . \nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that\'s alain\'s exact double . \nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \nalain does some investigating . \nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \nassuming michael\'s identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael\'s girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \nthat\'s as much as you need to know . \nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \nthere\'s a love story , too , but i didn\'t find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \nshe\'s great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can\'t really be described as \" acting . \" \nof course , \" acting \" isn\'t really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme\'s ) . \nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme\'s stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \nthere\'s only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \ndon\'t get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo\'s hard-boiled , it\'s an amazing moment . \nbut it\'s a moment that\'s hard to reproduce in hollywood . \n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn\'t yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \nwhile woo\'s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam\'s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam\'s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there\'s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn\'t always overcome the limitations of its genre . \nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme\'s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \nbut it\'s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it\'s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man\'s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \n',1
'synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . \nthere is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . \nwithin the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . \npreserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . \nmanipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a \" phantom \" menace . \njedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala\'s home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . \non the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nthe five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . \ncan they free amidala\'s helpless planet ? \nopinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace\'s greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . \ngiven this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . \ndoes phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? \ndirector george lucas answers , \" it\'s only a movie . \" \nto me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . \nvisually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . \nit is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera . \nat least this much is clear : there\'s plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it\'s good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . \nweaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . \nat first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . \nthis dilutes the central story . \nadditionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . \nveteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . \nbetter ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . \nstrengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . \nthe film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . \nbottom line ? \nseeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . \nwe are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months . \n',1

'studio expectations must not have been high for \" great expectations \" -- the film\'s release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . \nit\'s actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn\'t quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year . \n \" great expectations \" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann\'s \" william shakespeare\'s romeo + juliet . \" \n \" great expectations \" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . \nthere\'s icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn\'s ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella\'s auntie who\'s quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . \nfinn , who lives with his sister\'s affable boyfriend ( lone star\'s chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor\'s lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . \nflash forward into the \'90s ( after a brief stop in the \'80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it\'s enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . \nthere , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . \nwhen estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . \nbut she\'s not the only ghost from finn\'s past that\'s going to be paying him a visit . \ncomparisons with the afore-mentioned \" romeo + juliet \" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . \n \" great expectations \" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where \" romeo \" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . \nthe movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki\'s sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that\'s steamier than the film\'s ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . \nthe eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . \nacting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay\'s occasional slip-ups . \nhawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from \" gattaca \" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . \npaltrow\'s estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . \nwhile the actress is at her icily seductive best , we\'re not told very much about her character , and as a result , it\'s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don\'t quite understand why she\'s fueling his fire . \nrobert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . \nalfonso cuaron\'s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie\'s climax . \nanother problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren\'t familiar with the story . \ndespite its script flaws , though , \" great expectations \" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . \nand frankly , it\'s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . \nperhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine\'s day , will end up helping \" great expectations \" \' seemingly average box office chances after all . \n',1
'taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . \nthe story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . \neverything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . \nalthough qt\'s touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nliman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . \nthe film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . \nthere\'s a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . \nthe young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . \nholmes , one of the dawson\'s creek cast ( a show i\'m not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . \naskew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . \nno doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of \'funny annoying\' he\'s just annoying . \nhe drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . \nthe real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . \nalso entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . \nthe script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . \nit starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it\'s footing and just keeps getting better . \nthe stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there\'s too much attention on one detail but not on another . \nalso , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . \nstill , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . \nit could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . \nbecause this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go\'s one is pretty decent . \nunlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . \ngo is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . \nthankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) \nthey are who they are and they stay that way . \ngo is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . \nignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \nerm , go to go , i guess . \n',1
'1992\'s alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979\'s alien and 1986\'s aliens , savaged david fincher\'s slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \nwhat could be next ? \nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also \" infected \" with alien dna . \nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection\'s clever streak in writing stops . \nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \nas technically adept as jeunet\'s direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon\'s ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott\'s alien or the even greater film that james cameron\'s aliens was . \nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher\'s alien3 , jeunet\'s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \n',1
'jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . \nin as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . \nhe\'s mean . \ni mean really mean . \nthe opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . \nevery day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . \nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . \none day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . \nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . \nanother person who often crosses melvin\'s sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin\'s floor . \naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . \nsimon\'s friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . \nwhen simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon\'s dog while he convalesces . \nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . \nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin\'s softening up to the world around him . \nit doesn\'t happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . \none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . \nhe\'s traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . \ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . \nthey play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . \ngreg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . \nhe gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . \ncuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . \nthe screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . \nthe best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . \nmelvin is a man we can\'t quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . \ncarol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . \nsimon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . \ncombined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . \nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . \nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . \ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film\'s conclusion . \nthere\'s one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie\'s best scenes and who deserves mention . \nthis is that little dog . \nhe plays such a pivotal role to melvin\'s character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . \naward or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you\'ve got an outstanding movie . \n',1
' \" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! \" \nmrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . \n \" didn\'t i sound just like a mother ? \" \n \" you are a mother , \" her son marty tells her disgustedly . \n \" i know , but i still can\'t believe it . \ni look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? \" \nmarty , you see , is a grown-up twin . \nalthough his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . \nmother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . \nmost dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . \nthe daughter\'s fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being . \nmrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level . \nshe explains to marty\'s new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty\'s private part when she came out of the womb . \nthe dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment . \nthe script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters . \nthe exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family\'s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane . \nin this storm are two sane individuals . \nthe fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o\'s bitter pseudo-sophistication . \nas the two twins\' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother\'s fiancee that night . \n \" we all have our secrets , \" jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few . \nthis is a house filled with them . \n ( when lesly calls it the family\'s \" home \" to mrs . pascal -- they\'ve never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their \" house . \" ) \nin a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , \" made for each other , \" the twin\'s biggest , but not their only secret , is that they\'ve had a long-term incestuous relationship . \nthey don\'t like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . \nperfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . \njackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . \nin one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . \nmarty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . \nthe chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . \nthey put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . \ntheir ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . \ndirector mark waters keeps the show\'s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . \nhis crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . \njackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . \nand being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . \n \" were you poor ? \" \njackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . \n \" did you eat pies ? \nchicken pot pies ? \" \n \" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , \" lesly replies with her usual sincerity . \n \" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , \" \njackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . \n \" are we entertaining royalty ? \" \nwith rolfe kent\'s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . \nwill it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? \nthe emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . \ni\'ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . \nthe house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . \nit is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . \nthe movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 . \n',1
'big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . \no . j . \nsimpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . \nall these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . \nand , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . \nwhether it be john grisham\'s thrilling novels or television\'s famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . \nso when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . \nhowever , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . \njohn travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . \nno one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . \nbut , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . \na civil action is not john\'s best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . \ntravolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . \nhis performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . \nif he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . \nluckily , he has a strong supporting cast . \nwilliam h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . \nhe continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . \nin a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta\'s paranoid and greedy accountant . \nhe is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . \nhe is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . \nbut , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . \nrobert duvall is also an underrated actor . \nhe gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . \nduvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . \nduvall is magical in this role . \nhe is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . \nin many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . \nunfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . \nhowever , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . \nthis is not the case in a civil action . \nthey have comedy coming from all sides . \nwhether it be duvall\'s inane questions or macy\'s sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . \ngranted , it\'s not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . \nthe plot is terrific- somewhat . \nthe setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . \nthen the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) \'s career rears its ugly head . \nthey find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . \nhowever , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . \ni will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . \nthe courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . \nit left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . \nall in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . \nhis supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . \nthe film is smart , witty and thought provoking . \nnot only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . \na civil action provides everything a drama lover craves . \n',1
'it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film . \ni knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . \nbut i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . \ni figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . \ni may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? \ni needn+t have worried . \n+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ . \nsurprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . \nthey make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . \nthe plot is typical . \nthirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . \nas luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . \nwhy , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . \nhe hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . \nhe becomes one of the great comic villains . \nupon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . \nit is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself . \nwould the geek get the girl ? \npuh-lease . \nthe ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . \nbut the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs . \nthe dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . \nand yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . \nmary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . \nshe is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . \nearl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . \nmary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . \ncameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . \nben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . \nbraces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . \ndillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . \nand rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . \nnot everything works . \nchris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . \nthere+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . \nand there are long stretches without much going on . \nbut the wait is worth it . \nwhen those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . \nbelly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . \nthe farrelly brothers have finally done it . \nyes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been . \nwhile tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me . \nwhile raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ . \nand it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . \nafter the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . \napproach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely . \n',1
'it\'s terribly unfortunate that \" stir of echoes , \" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996\'s unsung treasures , \" the trigger effect \" ) , should be released little more than a month after \" the sixth sense , \" which is still going strong at the box office . \nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , \" stir of echoes \" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while \" the sixth sense \" is closer to a psychological drama . \nadditionally , while \" the sixth sense \" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , \" stir of echoes \" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . \nand where \" the sixth sense \" was disturbing , \" stir of echoes \" is just plain scary . \ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . \nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , \" stir of echoes \" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . \nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . \nfinally , he asks , \" does it hurt to be dead ? \" \napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn\'t the focus of the picture . \ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie\'s new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn\'t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \nshe didn\'t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \n \" stir of echoes \" isn\'t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997\'s \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" \nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie\'s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995\'s \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom\'s visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn\'t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she\'s dead gives one pause . \" \nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994\'s \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998\'s \" whatever , \" as morrison\'s grieving teenage sister , debbie . \nif the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn\'t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \n \" stir of echoes \" isn\'t as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? \nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \n',1
'true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . \neven the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . \nso it\'s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get \" the apostle \" onto the big-screen . \nas a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . \nhe also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . \nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it\'s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . \nand , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . \nsonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . \nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . \nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film\'s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . \nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . \none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . \nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . \nat his son\'s baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife\'s lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . \nnot knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . \nhe throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . \nin the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . \nafter befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town\'s ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . \nre-christening himself as \" the apostle e . f . , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other\'s lives . \nbut , always , sonny\'s past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . \nduvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . \nin a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . \nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" \nthe strength of duvall\'s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he\'s being sincere with the subject matter . \nafter fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . \nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \n \" i\'ve always called you jesus and you\'ve always called me sonny , \" he says . \nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny\'s mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there\'s no sense trying to interrupt him . \nthe main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . \nsonny\'s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . \nhowever , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . \nin his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . \nand , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . \nit is that strength in sonny\'s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . \nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . \nwatching duvall on-screen , it\'s not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . \nas sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . \nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . \nas a director , duvall feels that less is more . \nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . \nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . \nduvall knew that the power of the film\'s characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn\'t need to be artificially enhanced . \nin this way , \" the apostle \" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . \n',1
'after a rather disappointing \" mary railly \" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise . \nthis is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart . \nin fact it\'s not even a comedy . \nit\'s a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs . \nbased on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity\'\' is a wry and likable story about a man\'s quest for fulfillment and happiness . \nrob gordon was a dj . \nit seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life . \nnow he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york . \nwhen he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose . \ndecimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what\'s right and what\'s important . \nhe starts \" categorizing \" life , dividing it into \" top 5 lists \" . \nand the most important is the \" top 5 list \" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy . \nthough you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn\'t seem that way and all rob\'s relationships were different versions of that first . \nwhere did he go wrong ? \nwas it he that screwed up ? \nor maybe life just stinks ? \nwhile he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the \" top 5 list \" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together . \nwith clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me . \nalthough a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word . \nand here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned . \nhe is simply superb . \nit is as much his movie as it is frears\' . \nthe film would not be the same without him . \ncusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony . \nmost of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off . \nhis interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears\' message simply can\'t be ignored or overseen . \nthe other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job . \nboth ______ and jack black are fabulous . \neven catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful . \nhowever , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob\'s co-worker and friend dick . \nthis is such an impressive achievement that it\'s almost worth a oscar-nomination . \nhe is simply a joy to behold . \notherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears\' colorful blend . \npretty much like edward norton\'s \" keeping the faith \" , this film doesn\'t follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it\'s dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry . \nit\'s a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself . \nnothing seems unreal or staged . \nit reflects reality as a mirror . \nas you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character . \nyou feel and think and reflect . \nthis effect has become a rarity nowadays . \nalthough it\'s primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity\'\' is secondarily about pop music . \nrob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs . \nmusic is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives . \nand so does the movie . \nit is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob\'s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments . \nin the end , you have gained something while watching it . \nit\'s not the film of the century or even of the year . \nit\'s not an special effects extravaganza . \nit doesn\'t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed . \nit\'s a small movie about the big things . \nand even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . \n',1
'in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library , casablanca was my third classic in some weeks . \nthe others being citizen kane and vertigo ( yes , i am trying to see as many of afi\'s greatest movies ever made as i can ) . \nbut , casablanca stood out from the rest for me : it was actually watchable . \nwhat most hail as the greatest american film ever , casablanca isn\'t so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in . \nit seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman . \nthat annoyed me , as did the ending . \nwhy didn\'t the plan turn around ? ! ? \nsurprisingly , i enjoyed the film . \ni liked bogart\'s character and his acting ( not over the top as most actors in his era ) . \ni once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie , which one would it be , and a women said casablanca . \nat first i was thinking to myself \" why ? \" \nthen , as i watched the film again , i understood why . \nthe movie is very well done and the script top-notch , although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo . \ncasablanca is , in my mind , no classic ( like solaris ) , but it is a good film and stylishly shot . \nhey , hollywood , how about this : a remake with harrison ford and anne heche ? \nnow that would be a classic . \n',1
'along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view . \nfor all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart . \nthe australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role . \naccepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood . \nit was , definitely , an enormous risk but i\'m sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face . \nbraveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film . \nfor three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative\'s rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest . \nthe william wallace\'s story is the story of so many others brave liberty\'s defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries . \nseeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland . \nas the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up . \nhis courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward\'s son . \nhowever , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought . \nbraveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays . \nmel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast . \npatrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank . \nthe scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good . \nsophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart . \ni also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace . \nhowever , i think this time the mel gibson\'s work as director was much better than his work as actor . \nthe excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is . \nwhen we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film . \nbraveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 ! \ni\'ve heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean . \nfor now , let\'s see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia . \nit won\'t be easy ! \nit\'s gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson . \n',1
'every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections . \nsuch is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life . \ndespite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film . \nyou probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick . \nwill hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it . \nhe likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer . \nhe ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk . \nafter getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor . \nafter outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems . \nin the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love . \nthe story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film . \neven though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character . \nalas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it . \nthe one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character . \nis it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? \nof course . \nis it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? \nusually , yes . \nbut , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? \nnot very likely . \ncome on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school \ngirls . \nwill is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition . \nthe heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary . \nall this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways . \ndamon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary . \nwhich leads me to the really good part of the review . \nthe strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting . \ni can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom . \nfrom minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent . \nrobin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line . \nthe real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting . \nthe scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen . \nwhen i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about . \nwatching these two work is what going to see movies is all about . \ngus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score . \ni highly recommend ? good will hunting ? . \ndespite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year . \n',1

'when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . \nnow , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster\'s involvement in the project , i thought \" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? \" . \nas it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . \nrobert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . \ndon\'t get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference . \nbased on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . \nallie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . \nshe spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . \nher passion for `long-distance communication\' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . \na scene which particularly strengthens the audiences\' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied \" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now \" . \nallie\'s research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . \nher work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer\'s money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . \nundaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers\' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . \nthe following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . \nthe news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . \nthe situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . \nas the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . \nshe enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . \nher eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president\'s spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . \nat this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president\'s spiritual advisor . \na strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . \nfrom the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . \nthe meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . \nmany people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . \nzemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . \ncontact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . \ni consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year . \n',1
'when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called \" the postman , \" i thought , \" an american version of \'il postino ? \' \nstarring costner ? \ngod help us ! \" \nwhen i found out that it was not a remake of \" postino \" but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , \" \'landworld ? \' \nplease , god , make him stop ! \" \nas it turns out , \" the postman \" is a much better film than i had expected . \ndespite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back . \nthe setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages . \nthe struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it . \ncostner\'s nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king . \nour hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman . \ntaking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of \" the restored united states . \" \nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets . \none young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service . \nford spreads the postman\'s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule . \nas war breaks out between bethlehem\'s army and the postal workers , costner\'s character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution . \nhis lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . \n \" postman \" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of \" sergio leone meets frank capra \" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling . \nwhat could have been another knock-off of \" the road warrior \" ( like \" waterworld \" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble . \ntate is the stand-out in the movie\'s large cast . \nford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate\'s character in his debut film , \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford\'s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog\'s cynicism and brutality . \nhis performance sells the movie . \ninterestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain . \nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postman\'s love interest , abby . \nwhen they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile . \npredictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero . \nhowever , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) . \n \" the postman \" is costner\'s best work thus far . \nperhaps that alone gives us hope for the future . \n . \n . \n',1
'sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist \nby fernando vallejo \nstarring bob flanagan and sheree rose . \ninterviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia . \nproduced and directed by kirby dick . \nrunning time : 90 mins . \nthis film is not rated . \nthe central themes of \" sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist \" are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person\'s life . \nits protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing . \nthe movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease . \nan audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , \" sick \" chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film . \nflanagan\'s idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff\'s brilliant 1994 \" crumb \" , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one . \nboth crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects . \nbut flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures . \nbehold these works of physical art . \namong them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus , and , --the most disturbing scene of the decade-- , nailing his penis to a board . \nflanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking . \nnot only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment . \nmost with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there\'s also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her . \n ) \nbut the most outstanding thing about \" sick \" is flanagan\'s relationship with sheree . \nbrimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts \" sick \" into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people . \nthe last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous . \nit goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy . \n',1
'in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . \ndespite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . \nin terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . \nshe is one ? hot\' babe who defines true ? woman leadership\' . \nshe not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . \nno thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . \nthe young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero . \nin fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners . \ni mean it would be interesting to see yoda\'s girlfriend for a change , if he has one . \nnot much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life . \nalso fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian\' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe . \nand it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force . \nmore humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force . \noverall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it\'s predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor . \nby all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan . \nwatch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio . \n',1
'in \" magic town \" , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a \" perfect \" town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll-takers care about . \nhowever , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he\'s doing is wrong . \nthe plot is standard stuff , but that\'s not important . \nin a film like this , it\'s the calibre of the actors that make or break it . \nobviously , since stewart stars , that\'s practically a non-issue . \nhe\'s great in the film , as usual . \nthere\'s just something about him that always manages to be endearing , even when he\'s deceiving the town folk . \nyou\'re always on his side , and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition . \nthe film was directed by a longtime frank capra script-writer , and it shows . \nthis is the type of feel-good picture that capra is famous for . \nby the time \" the end \" shows up on screen , everything has been wrapped up very nicely . \nthere are no loose ends , and virtually every character gets a happy ending ( those that deserve one , anyway ) . \nin this age of cynicism , it\'s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat . \n \" magic town \" is a delightfully entertaining motion picture . \nif you believe all old movies are slow-paced , you\'d be well-advised to check this one out . \n',1
'martin scorsese\'s films used to intimidate me . \nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \ni learned from scorsese\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \ni don\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \nit shouldn\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \nthe movie\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \nit\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\'s life is in danger if he stays . \nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \nthe story doesn\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \nit just doesn\'t fit that mold . \nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \nfor those who don\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \npeople won\'t be flocking to kundun for it\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .

'with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \nhanding over the director\'s chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver\'s presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won\'t call the families back . \nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley\'s story seems much more feasible . \none of the company\'s directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt\'s surrogate mother . \nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott\'s version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \ni can\'t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don\'t always have to be flat characters . \njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn\'t fighting ) . \nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv\'s \" mad about you \" ) . \na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \ntechnically astonishing , aliens\' only flaw is small

'after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . \nthis new film has been underrated for no reason . \nit is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla\'s pervious films . \nit is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . \nthe only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some \" unfinished \" developments of some characters . \nthe film elegantly begins with nino rota\'s recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael\'s voice as he is writing a letter to his children : \" the only wealth in this world is children . \nmore than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure \" . \nthe year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of \" part ii \" to make his father\'s dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . \nmichael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . \nconstantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . \nthe family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . \nlater that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , \" a check in the amount of $100 million . \" \nbut the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . \nsure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . \nbut god does not take payoffs . \nthe plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . \nthere is a moment in \" godfather iii \" where michael says : \" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . \nbut the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . \" \n . \nvisually this film is as spectacular as the first two . \ngordon willis\' rich cinematography , carmine copolla\'s beautiful composition and alex tavoularis\' wonderful art direction could not be better . \nbut copolla\'s first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . \nthe third installment has only the plot and visuals . \nsome characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . \nthe biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . \nthe best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . \nandy garcia is powerful as sonny\'s son , strong , focused and loyal . \nviolence is natural to him . \nhe suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family\'s behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . \nhowever both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . \nand characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . \nthe good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . \nin the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . \nthis parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo\'s character was more developed . \nmany have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . \ni disagree . \nit is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . \nthe first film showed some horrible results of corleone\'s life . \nit showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . \na man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . \nthe third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael\'s life . \nthe life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . \nthere is no turning back . \nand no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . \nthe beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . \nhere he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven \n',1
'this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \n \" shine \" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \" life \" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \" love and other catastrophes \" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \ni can\'t recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \n \" shine \" was one bookend . \nstand by for the other one : \" dead heart \" . \n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \nbryan | brown . \nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing \" white man\'s justice \" to the aboriginals . \nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \" payback \" . \nan eye for an eye . \nrevenge . \nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient\'s thigh . \nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \nhe admits that he has to \'bend the rules\' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \" payback \" . \n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \nhe is part churchman and part politician . \nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \nshe appears to not know this . \ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it\'s payback time . \nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \neveryone is affected in the fall out . \nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \nsuffice to say it\'s a rewarding experience . \nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \nit wasn\'t long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it\'s vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon \'invaders\' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \nin a year when the race \'debate\' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \nhe is asked to say if he is a \" black fella or white fella \" . \n',1

'jerry springer has got nothing on \" wild things . \" \njohn mcnaughton\'s new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer\'s notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they\'re all part of the movie\'s raucous , complex storyline . \nbut even trash tv topicality can\'t drag \" wild things \" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you\'d find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . \ndespite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there\'s wicked fun to be had here . \n \" wild things \" would be a guilty pleasure , only there\'s no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it . \nhigh school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave\'s most financially prominent . \nhoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo\'s house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . \nbefore long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly\'s rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . \nlombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . \nthe previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven\'t seen any of the movie\'s spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph . \nwhile cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her . \nto pay lombardo for the damages , kelly\'s mother breaks her daughter\'s trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million . \nbut lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . \nduquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there\'s more afoot to the case than just false accusations . \nif there\'s a major drawback to \" wild things , \" it\'s that it\'s oversexed to a fault . \nthe much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off . \nit\'s also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . \nwhat we don\'t see is far more effective than what we do . \nanother example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . \ner , no thanks . \nalso , bacon\'s duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . \ndaphne rubin-vega , from broadway\'s \" rent , \" tries to compensate for a superfluous character . \ntheresa russell is just plain wooden . \nand when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . \nbut what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end . \n \" wild things \" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can\'t help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . \na great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray\'s a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo\'s case and flipping them off . \nand don\'t leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you\'ll miss the film\'s best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . \nspeaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" \nmatt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . \nneve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . \nre-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . \nbut what we\'re given works well enough . \n \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . \n',1
'the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . \' \nthe elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . \nhe has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . \nalways the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . \nthis involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . \nwhen he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . \nnow a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . \ncarol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . \nshe\'s a very bright person with a good heart . \nyet , her life is a miserable waste of time . \nthe most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . \nher days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . \nworse , she\'s in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . \nthey became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . \nto her , this made sense long ago . \nbut now , it\'s a different story . \nwayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . \nwayne\'s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . \ncarol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she\'s never been anywhere else and doesn\'t see many other opportunities in life . \nhowever , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . \nthe medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . \ncarol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . \nmaybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . \nthe opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . \' \nand what are some of carol\'s resuscitation techniques ? \nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \nif that fails , maybe she\'ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie\'s direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \nhenry and carol\'s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \nmeanwhile , this is carol\'s ticket to a better life . \nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \n`where the money is\' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he\'s still really hot stuff . \nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it\'s hard to ignore that `where the money is\' is where the fun is . \n',1

'underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . \n1998\'s \'hope floats\' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . \nwe always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . \nthis year \'double jeopardy\' is one of those films . \ncritics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . \nbut as i viewed \'double jeopardy\' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . \nthe always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . \nher husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . \nafter a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . \nof course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . \nhowever she isn\'t immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . \nshe pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . \nwhile making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby\'s heart stop right there . \nshe realizes she must get out and prove that he isn\'t dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . \nwhich means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . \nafter she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . \nhe is a man who has had his share of bad things . \nwhile out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . \nwhatever happens the film was excellent to me . \ni found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . \nashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . \neven if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don\'t know how . \nthis is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don\'t know how they are going to make it happen . \nit could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . \nthe movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . \nit gets most of it\'s power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . \nthe characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby\'s pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . \neven though a lot of critics didn\'t like the film , i loved it . \nthe director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . \ni found it not to be boring at all and it\'s only flaw comes from some predictability . \nit moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . \nit earns it\'s right to be a great movie and to me that\'s what it was . \n',1
'call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\'s consistently interesting , it\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he\'s taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\'re up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\'s geno\'s steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit\'s not that he\'s bad per se , but he\'s not very interesting . \nthere\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\'s or sutherland\'s work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \nhowever , despite the negatives , i\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \nit\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \nand , whatever you do , don\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \n',1

'it\'s an interesting premise . \nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . \nin truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . \nwhat we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . \nour bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . \nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . \nthe matrix isn\'t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one\'s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . \nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . \nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . \nthe group\'s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is \" the one \" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . \n>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . \nthis , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . \nwhat is reality ? \nwhat is a sham ? \nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side . \nmore than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . \nas viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . \nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? \nreeves , whom i\'ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . \nhe was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . \nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . \nin a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . \ni mean , since bill and ted\'s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? \nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne , who\'s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . \nvery surprising for a sci-fi movie . \nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . \nthis helps to further the aura of his character\'s proficiency and extensive knowledge . \nhugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence\'s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . \nunfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character\'s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . \ncarrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus\'s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . \nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn\'t in the picture . \nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . \nmany methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . \nof special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . \nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . \nthe motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . \nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . \npretty slick . \nthe matrix drips with style . \nfrom the clothing to the music to the action , we\'re watching an exaggerated version of what we\'re used to . \nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there\'s a lot of kung fu , there\'s a lot of gunplay . \nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . \nthere\'s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . \ncombined , it\'s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . \nthe film is not without its faults . \nsome of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . \nsome of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn\'t meant to be a joke . \nhowever , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . \n',1
'in 1977 , something never though possible happened . \nthe film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects . \nthe film set a new standard for special effects in film . \nnot only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself . \nthe plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . \nthe legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi . \nthe jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side . \ndarth vader is the leader of the dark side . \nben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today . \ndarth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side . \nyears after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble . \nr2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call \" driods \" , or robots that are of assistance to humans . \nwhile an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship . \nto obi-wan kenobi pleading for help . \nthe princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine . \nthe jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell . \nthey are bought by luke skywalker\'s ( mark hamill ) family . \nwhile luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found . \nluke finds this obi-wan kenobi , and learns that obi-wan was a friend of luke\'s father , who is now dead . \nluke also learns his family was a jedi . \nafter luke\'s family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all . \nben wants to create a new jedi . \nfirst , the two must find princess leia and serve her . \nhan solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary . \nafter meeting up with leia , the film really picks up . \nluke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur . \nstar wars is an amazing epic . \nthe plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it . \nthe special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic . \nthe space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch . \nthe ships flown by all are very unique and creative . \nthe costumes are also out of this world . \nthe scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before . \nthere are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever . \nthe entire premise of star wars is amazing . \nthe creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind . \neven the human characters are different . \nevery character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films . \nthe acting on everyone\'s part is great , especially that of sir alec guinness\'s . \neven though the concept is not realistic at all , it is pulled off very nicely . \nthe acting , setting , effects , costumes , and sound make it work . \nif any of these were messed up , star wars would have come off as one huge joke . \nthe ending works very well , and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward . \nin early 1997 , a special edition of star wars was released . \nthe film was re-mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977 . \na few creatures were added here and there , and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt ( seen in return of the jedi ) was added to the film . \nthink that\'s enough ? \non may 19 , 1999 , star wars episode i : the phantom menace will be released , followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope . \nwith this , star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time . \n',1
'many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . \nwhile possibly shallow , i\'ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . \nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world\'s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille\'s and stepahne\'s characters . \ni am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil\'s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" \nthis movie is not about judging stephane\'s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . \nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \nthe synergism of the tension of ravel\'s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \nemmanuelle beart\'s personality is beautiful . \nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \n',1
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nlike its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \nas boogie nights opens , he\'s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \nrecruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \nwholeheartedly embraced by jack\'s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \nhis lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson\'s accomplished command of the camera is without question . \nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco\'s unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \nit\'s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker\'s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it\'s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he\'s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he\'s borrowing from some of the best , and it\'s entirely effective within the context of this film . \nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it\'s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \nwhile much of the film\'s humour pertains to the characters\' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope\'s demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get \'freaky deaky\' with the music -- it\'s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk\'s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \nably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson\'s personal collection ) , there\'s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \nit\'s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film\'s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \nafter the debacle with 1996\'s milos forman film , the people vs . \nlarry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \nhowever , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it\'s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there\'s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horner\'s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there\'s a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it\'s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \nif anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \njack horner\'s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \nin both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack\'s retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer\'s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood\'s \" it\'s not about the little details , it\'s about the big picture ! \" \nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \nin boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers\' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there\'s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an \'artistic\' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i\'ve ever done \" , it\'s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \nmr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn\'t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film\'s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film\'s * protagonist * literally doesn\'t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it\'s no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film\'s finest exchanges . \nand while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it\'s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film\'s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore\'s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character\'s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \nstill , even if he doesn\'t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \nin any case , it\'s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it\'s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger\'s \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \nif this scene already wasn\'t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \nmr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \nsimilarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver\'s seat , sobbing \" i\'m so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver\'s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \nmr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard\'s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \ni\'m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \nmr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it\'s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \nmr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \nms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \nconsequently , it\'s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she\'s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she\'s essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \n ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \nand a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham\'s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant\'s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \ndraw your own conclusions . \nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it\'s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \nwhile the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle\'s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \nluis guzman\'s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma\'s carlito\'s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who\'s a hanger-on to jack\'s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \njack\'s eventual acquiescence to maurice\'s request leads to one of boogie nights\' biggest comic payoffs . \nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there\'s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year . \n',1
'because the press screening of \" planet of the apes \" was one day past last issue\'s deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . \nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg\'s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . \nto those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? \nthis is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . \ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . \nfor the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated \" mars attacks ! \" \n ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage \" mars attacks ! \" \ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . \nburton\'s re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . \nthe apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . \nlike astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . \nas for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . \nfrom his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . \nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . \nas for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . \nhe doesn\'t want to lead humanity and he isn\'t looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . \nas a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . \nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn\'t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . \nfor the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . \nthe 1968 \" apes \" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . \nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . \nthe 2001 \" planet of the apes \" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . \nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that\'s nothing to complain about . \n',1

\nwhy do people fall out of love ? \nhow do people fall back into love , once they\'ve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? \nall of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships . \nmeet a hip , young couple going through their first date . \na divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships . \na married woman \" finding herself \" while cheating on her husband . \na husband letting go of his inhibitions . \nan older couple dealing with a past \" love \" of the man , a secret recently uncovered . \na son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital . \nthere are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity . \ndiversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels . \nsome related to the younger couples\' issues . \nothers with the married . \nthere\'s a little bit of everything for everyone in here . \nand i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament . \njust like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels . \nthe actors in this film are all also very , very good . \nsean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations . \njolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever . \nanderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart . \neven dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination . \nthe only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn . \nthe actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else . \nthe ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that\'s just hollywood . \nthis film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5 . 5/10 ) and happiness ( 4 . 5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness . \nthe characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today\'s relationships . \nall in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much . \non top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al . ) to do the same . \nthis is director/writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of \" adult films \" . \nbefore this , he had written and produced many children\'s movies . \ngillian anderson stands 5\'2 . \nangelina jolie\'s full name is angelina jolie voight . \nshe is actor jon voight\'s daughter . \nshe has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute . \nshe divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting ( 8 . 5/10 ) \nfame in 1997 . \nthey were married in 1995 . \nactor ryan phillippe\'s full name is matthew ryan phillippe . \nhe stands 5\'9 , and spent his childhood in new castle , delaware . \nhis acting career started on tv\'s \" one life to live \" . \nhe portrayed daytime television\'s first gay teenager . \njon stewart\'s full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz . \nthis film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture . \nwatch for movie posters from swingers ( 8 . 5/10 ) , \nchasing amy ( 7/10 ) and the texas chainsaw massacre ( 8/10 ) at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date . \n',1
'carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall . \nthe film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects . \naction and science fiction just don\'t get any better than this ! \nthe story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) . \nquaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars . \nwhile being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid\'s memory has previously been erased . \nnow the people who did it are after him . \nquaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead . \nthe plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist . \nit grabs you and never lets go ! \nthis film is a winner from beginning to end . \nthe plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga . \nschwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too . \nthe action and stunts are terrific . \nthe sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail . \nthe music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action . \nthe make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish . \nthe visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal ! \nthe visuals had such a state of the art \" slickness \" that they won an oscar . \nof course the film isn\'t always realistic ; it\'s more fiction than science . \nfor example , it is true that a body won\'t explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do . \nwho cares ? \nit\'s a movie . \nmovies are supposed to entertain . \nand in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat . \n',1
'call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . \nthe finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . \nyou look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . \nwe will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . \nin gridlock\'d , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . \nshakur and roth play ezekiel \" spoon \" whitmore and alexander \" stretch \" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . \nwhen a new year\'s eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . \nthey soon make a new year\'s resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . \nas though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . \nthe government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . \nin order for you to buy into gridlock\'d at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year\'s day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . \ngridlock\'d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991\'s falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . \nin falling down , michael douglas\' d-fens ( the character\'s personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock\'d by the drug lord d-reper\'s plates ) whips out a gun because he can\'t get breakfast at mcdonald\'s ; in gridlock\'d , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . \nand where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . \none bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , \" do you expect the world to stop . . . just \nbecause you picked _today_ to clean up ? \" \nthe world in gridlock\'d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . \nhall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . \na significant chunk of gridlock\'d is devoted to spoon and stretch\'s flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . \nin one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . \nthe entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . \nhall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film\'s main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . \noh , the irony of it . \ntupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . \nin gridlock\'d , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . \nspoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . \nmostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . \nit is spoon who plays conscience to stretch\'s pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon\'s goal as any agency or enemy . \ngridlock\'d\'s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch \" helping \" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . \nwith friends like that , spoon doesn\'t need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . \nthe tragedy now is that we won\'t get more chances to see those eyes again . \n',1
'i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer . \nit\'s pretty good in it\'s own right , yes , but i would probably split the \" best movie \" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon . \nit\'s main problem is that it\'s quickly forgettable , and i can\'t remember one truly good scene from it . \nfrom con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt . \nin spawn , it was the \" living room hell \" conclusion at the end . \nin event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell\'s forces . \nand all of face/off was pretty dang good . \nbut as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches . \ni remember it not for it\'s humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted . \nand yes , i did see mimic , which is something i\'ll touch on in a later review . \nback to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) \ni remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren\'t comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy\'s life is to boy scots . \nokay , that one was pretty pathetic . ) \nfew people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find . \nthis was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o\'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black . \nkind of weird , huh ? ) \nall i can say is , thank god they didn\'t cast chris o\'donnell . \ni know i can\'t be the only person on the planet who thinks he\'s an annoying , preppie little snot . . . \nsorry . \nmy apologies to o\'donnell fans . \ni actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely . \nhe decided not to sell them to me , because they were \" innappropriate \" . \nhmm . . . . \nso now you\'re probably wondering why i\'ve wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years . \ngood question . \ni\'ll move on to the movie now . \nas you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it\'s nickname mib ( men in black . ) \nmen in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they\'re mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they\'re here on earth . \nnot to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven\'t seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer\'s yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe . \nnot bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that . \ni\'m not even really paying attention anymore . ) \nthe special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black . \ni found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the \" cool weapons \" they had . \nthe noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said . \nand the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln\'t have . \nit\'s director , barry sonnenfield , is known for \" black humor \" , directing both addams family movies . \nthis movie was basically a \" black comedy \" , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers . \ndon\'t get me wrong on what i think of this movie . \nit\'s not bad , i gave it * * * . \nit was mostly entertaining throughout it\'s run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it . \nmy diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket . \nof course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that\'s beside the point . \ni think . \n',1
'brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . \nsince scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . \nconsequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito\'s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . \nit doesn\'t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . \ncarlito\'s way , while hampered by depalma\'s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . \ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . \nin 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . \nhe declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . \namong those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito\'s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . \ncarlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . \nold ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can\'t seem to shake . \ncarlito\'s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . \nin the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . \nboth highlight depalma\'s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . \nyet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . \ncarlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . \nbut where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there\'s more of an immediacy to carlito\'s way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . \nyou sense that there\'s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . \nindeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : \" you don\'t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . \" \npacino captures carlito\'s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . \nsean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . \na jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . \nhe could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . \nhe shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . \nas compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . \ndepalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . \nhe even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \nfrom a story standpoint , there\'s an obligatory love story with a cliche\'d long-suffering girlfriend character . \npenelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn\'t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . \nstill , it\'s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . \nthe two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn\'t break . \ncarlito\'s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . \nthose willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . \n',1
'catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up . \nshe has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy\'s parents aren\'t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life . \nas if trying to assure the boy\'s parents wasn\'t hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane\'s mental faculties . \na vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d\'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls . \njust after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia . \nthe police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim\'s body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state . \nin a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher\'s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . . \na cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! \ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \'s \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \nin my opinion , d\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \na sequence where catherine enters stargher\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \n',1
'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \ni didn\'t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \nfor those of you who don\'t know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , \" a graduate of several 12-step programs . \" \nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \nstuart\'s relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d\'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \nthen , disaster strikes . \nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \nalthough smalley\'s dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called \" serious dramas \" of today . \nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven\'t seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \nyou\'ll laugh . . . you\'ll \ncry . . . . it\'s \nall there . \n',1
'50\'s `aliens vs . \nearth\' idea revamped ! \nif you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . \nit promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . \nid4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . \nthe premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50\'s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . \nthe movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . \nthe aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . \nthe us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens\' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . \ncapt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . \nhis squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . \nid4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . \nacting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . \nno prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . \nid4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . \nif i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . \nhowever below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . \nan idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . \nid4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . \nsome of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18\'s and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . \nid4 is a movie for all . \nthough there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . \nsit back and don\'t be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . \nif you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . \nthis film is best watched on the big-screen . \n',1
'tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . \nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . \n \" kundun \" ( \" presence \" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . \na group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . \nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as \" mine \" . \nhe and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . \nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . \nthe peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . \neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . \ncomparisons to \" seven years in tibet \" are inevitable . \nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner\'s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . \n \" kundun \" features only native actors and is more of an insider\'s story . \nin some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made \" seven years \" such an audience-pleaser . \nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . \nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . \non an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . \nsome events are depicted differently and pitt\'s austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama\'s life isn\'t even mentioned here . \nglossed over in \" seven years \" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses \" we were just about to change things \" after the chinese attack . \nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . \nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . \nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . \nthe visual treats more than make up for the movie\'s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . \nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . \nmartin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( \" goodfellas \" , \" taxi driver \" , \" casino \" ) has shifted gears . \nsomething of a thematic follow-up to his \" the last temptation of christ \" , this is his slowest film yet . \noddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . \nhis decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . \nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . \nphilip glass\'s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . \ni talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . \nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . \nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . \nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . \nwith the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . \none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can\'t resist being a kid sometimes . \nan encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren\'t many of these . \neven with its problems , the \" kundun \" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . \nmany people who saw \" seven years in tibet \" will have a \" been there , done that \" attitude . \nit\'s likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . \n',1
'it\'s wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina . \nthe crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain . \none half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station . \nthe other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away . \nthe police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads . \nat the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act . \nthat\'s the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . \ndeceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland\'s iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw\'s is 122 and braxton\'s is 102 ) . \nthe setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . \nover three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . \nother plot elements are thrown in for good measure . \nwayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . \nbraxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . \nand kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . \nthe foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth\'s death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . \ndeceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . \nthe atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . \ndeceiver has the power to grab an audience . \nunfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . \nfor , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . \nit\'s only an effective wrap-up if you don\'t think too carefully about its full implications . \nof course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . \npolice procedure is totally ignored and it\'s almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . \nbut the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . \ndeceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . \nthe pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth\'s final days and hours . \nthe most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . \nmoments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . \nthe movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . \nthere are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . \ncinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver\'s look . \nsome of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . \nas wayland , tim roth gives the film\'s top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . \nroth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he\'s supposed to be . \nthe other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren\'t as effective . \nboth play their characters like familiar types . \npenn\'s performance is uninspired ; rooker\'s lacks subtlety . \nsome of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . \nrenee zellweger , in a role that\'s miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . \nrosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw\'s wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who\'s entrusted with evaluating wayland\'s condition . \none of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . \nplot points aren\'t hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn\'t spelled out in bold letters . \nthe pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . \noccasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort . \n',1

it\'s worth it ) . \nseveral years later , mr . right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women . \nhedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity . \nbut tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar . \ncut to the present . \ntommy gnosis\' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him . \ndespite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in . \nif this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of \" tommy \" and \" rocky horror . \" \nas hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being . \nmitchell has world-class style and vocal chords to match . \neven though the backstory is unusually strong , mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical . \neverything is propelled by one terrific song after another and , trust me , these are full-fledged rock songs , not the over-processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals . \nwhile mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines . \nmiriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig\'s lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone . \ndecked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard , she makes a mighty attractive man . \nas always , \" sctv \" veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy , the angelic-appearing little rat . \nartist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical . \n \" hedwig and the angry inch \" surrounds a weird , funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast . \ntrue originals do not come along very often ? don\'t let this slip out of town without seeing it . \n',1

'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nme tarzan . . . you \nhappy viewer . \nfor a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney\'s latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . \n ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? \nyikes ! ) \nbut guess what- disney , a company that\'s been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . \nthe story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who\'s lost her young adopts him into her group . \nas he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he\'s so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor\'s lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . \nfrom there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? \nthe voicework here is pretty top-level . \ntony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o\' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan\'s best ape friend terk ; and wayne \" newman \" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . \nthe movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals . \nwhen tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol\' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . \ni couldn\'t believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . \nand the music\'s not half bad , either . \nfortunately , there\'s no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood . \nthere\'s some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons . \nbut , of course , it\'s not all action- there\'s a message here as well that has to do with family . \nthis is easily one of disney\'s best animated films of the decade and it\'s one i can\'t wait to put in my home library . . . that \nis , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 . \n',1
'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the \" film noir \" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \nthat main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" \nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\'s cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! \" ) . \nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \nif that doesn\'t give you a good idea of this film\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\'s rug . \nthey\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\'s \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \nthe film doesn\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this \" jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \nthere\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not stand \" speech . \nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" \nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . \nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \n \" it\'s good knowin\' he\'s out there , the dude , takin\' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end . \ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \n',1
'dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london . \nto boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story . \nmovies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it . \nalex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly . \nat times it moves beyond film into artwork . \nit is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? . \nthese aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning . \nthey are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight . \nduring this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) . \nwithout a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him . \ni don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him . \nit ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography . \nmurdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight . \nshadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine . \nwe see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song . \na great entrance . \nhowever , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied . \nthe city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching . \nblade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience . \nit is discussed it and argued , therefore a success . \nother science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy . \nwe ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element . \ndark city is not so easily explained away . \nas the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task . \nwhere is reality ? \ndark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films . \nperhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger . \nanyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it . \n',1
'i was pleasantly surprised by this film . \nwith a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century\'s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . \nhow much could you dress up the sets ? \nhow many models and computer effects could you use ? \nhow much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? \noh , if i\'ve just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . \nafter having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . \nthere have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i\'ve seen . \ntitanic tells its story in two time periods . \nit starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship . \nwhat they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news . \nthe woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas . \nthere she tells her story to lovett and his team . \nin 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society\'s upper class , boards the titanic for the ship\'s first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york . \nshe is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word . \non board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society\'s expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic\'s stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( \" steerage \" , as it\'s referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping . \nalthough for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose\'s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal . \nthe story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through . \ndicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors . \nhis is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . \ngirls are going to swoon over him . \nwinslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . \nthe only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character\'s upbringing . \nsimply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . \nrather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . \nbilly zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . \nhis features are such that even when he smiles , there\'s something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate . \nhe\'s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model . \nlike dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well . \nbacking up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal\'s personal assistant ( or \" man \" as they said at the turn of the century ) . \nno matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . \nadditionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as \" the unsinkable \" molly brown , danny nucci as jack\'s friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie . \nnice to see dr . bombay getting work . \nalso scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . \nthis by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship\'s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . \nin this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures . \nyou don\'t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well . \nas i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . \nthe interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . \nwith regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . \ncameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90\% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . \ncould\'ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless . \nalso of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning . \nwe are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner . \nthese technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion . \nin all , james cameron\'s titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action . \nthe fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer\'s attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie\'s intriguing beginning to it\'s satisfactory ending . \nin box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship . \n',1
'as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d-day , the weary , seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat . \nthey are unaware of exactly what is going to happen . \none man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck . \nas the flap falls , the battle begins . \nthey are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire . \namid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler\'s list . \na soldier , clearly missing an arm , wanders around the body-strewn beach like a lost puppy . \nwe are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself . \nhe bends over , picks up his arm and starts to carry it , probably not bothering to ask himself ; \" what now ? \" \nsaving private ryan is a masterfully composed film . \nthe direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar . \nthe cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding . \nbut be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen . \nthe articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get . \nthe question is , \" does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? \" \nthe answer from my point of view is \" no \" . \nbraveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film . \nryan is ten times worse . \nexpect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield . \nmany in the theater could not bear to watch . \nand it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year . \nbut such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) . \nsaving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film\'s primary mission . \ncaptain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield . \nthe government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan doesn\'t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice . \nmiller\'s crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they don\'t yet know him . \nthey resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn\'t have any more or less right to live than any of them . \nthis film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end . \nthe pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it\'s own . \nspielberg , though not a student of the \" quick cut \" school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it . \nbay should pay close attention , take copious notes . \nif you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan . \nin the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the \" importance \" of the film . \nschindler\'s list taught many people the truth about the holocaust . \nit opened eyes , sparked debate and study . \nthough the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they don\'t amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler\'s list . \noverall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , \" war is hell . \" \nbut braveheart-dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again . \nmasterful work marred only by excessive gore . \n',1
'the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? \nwhere else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the \" talking villains , \" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? \ni don\'t understand it myself , but that\'s what the bond series is based on . \nfor ( i think ) 18 films , we\'ve mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . \nbut even i , a king of cynicism , can\'t bitch about it . \nand \" tomorrow never dies , \" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception . \nthank god ! \nthe plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . \ninstead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he\'s out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . \nno , this is not \" wag the dog \" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in \ncomes bond . \njames is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and \nco-star of \" supercop , \" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . \nthe two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . \nluckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . \nthank god again . \nin every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn\'t spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . \nthere\'s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver\'s wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . \nyes , teri\'s very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . \nof course , it\'s not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she\'s only in a small part of it . \noh well . \nand there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . \nthis time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in \" from russia with love \" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . \nand for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . \nthe government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . \nand for no reason whatsoever , except \'cause he was so good in \" goldeneye , \" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . \nagain , oh well . \nthe action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long . \nthey pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the \nplot\'s not really essential ) . \nthey\'re more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . \nso what if they\'re distracting ; they\'re supposed to be ! \nthe acting , from most around is great . \nyeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she\'s so unique . \nthe better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them . \npussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of \" on her majesty\'s secret service \" only to be killed , added some emotional depth . \nyeoh is notable since she\'s so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . \npryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . \nand brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . \nthe bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they\'re so fun and add to the escapism . \nif you can remember the dalton years , and they\'re serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . \nthe series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . \ni don\'t really understand it myself , yet i\'m one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states . \nhaving seen all of them more than once ( yes , i\'ve seen this twice already ) , you can tell i adore them . \nwhile it\'s not one of the best , like \" goldfinger \" or \" from russia with love , \" \" tomorrow never dies \" is nonetheless a truly awesome installment , even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones . \n',1
'every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars \" sur-prise ! \" \ninto my bewildered visage . \nit\'s almost always a surprise . \nit sure as niflheim was this time . \namazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason . \nand , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a \" boy , i wish that could happen \" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash . \nanother e . t . \nanother short circuit . \nthis film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time . \namerica has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin\' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) . \namazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it\'s artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama . \nthis is a very sturdy scenario . \nthe principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role . \nthe writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the \" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen \" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! \nastounding ! \nhe uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it ! \ni am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it\'s so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film . \ni don\'t want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons . \nhis decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , \" amazing \" grace smith , and , well , i\'m leaving it at that because i wouldn\'t spoil this film for you for the world . \nlet me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply . \ni don\'t give a rat\'s ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i\'m recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it\'s an excellent story , told with excellence . \nno , i don\'t believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think . \nthe point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen . \nthis is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot . \nit carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness . \nspecial kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing\'s manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is \n',1
'the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made . \na captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget . \nin this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino\'s brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character\'s lives . \nthe first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together . \nmichael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group . \nafter a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works . \nthree of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married . \nafter the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times . \nthis sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war . \nthe wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act . \nthe outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future . \nthe second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong . \nthe men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river . \nthis prison , run by the v . c . , \ninitiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other . \nsteven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate . \nmichael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun . \npersonally , i felt that de niro\'s absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes . \nthe men are eventually able to escape , but are separated . \nmichael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital . \nmichael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero . \nhe wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him . \nhe assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam . \nthe third act concentrates more on walken\'s character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette . \nonly in this game , you play for money . \nmichael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him . \nthe two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home . \na very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed . \nthe greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino\'s directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling . \ndo not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you . \n',1
'wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say . \nthis story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that\'s too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie . \nthe story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home . \nhe wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law . \ntime passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement . \nby the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards . \nwyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact . \nwho can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? \nsomber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count \'em three , hammy death scenes ! \nstill , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff . \nhis , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character\'s credo of \" nothing counts as much as blood . \" \nequally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! ) \nsequence that is decidedly non-pc . \ndirector lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay . \nthe infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics . \ndon\'t look for much glorified violence here . \ndespite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life . \nthe diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! ) . \nkevin costner is very good in the title role . \ndances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch . \nhe was tougher in a perfect world . \nhis foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday . \ngaunt * and * gamely , he\'s a scene stealer who\'s seen too little . \nother familiar faces include tom sizemore ( looking like bruce mcgill ) , bill pullman ( looking like jeff daniels ) , and lea thompson ( looking like someone other than lea thompson ) . \nboth gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic , while late entries catherine o\'hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid . \nthough the story and score should\'ve tried \" less is more , \" all other credits are technical tops . \nproduction designer ida random , art director gary wissner , and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must\'ve been an enormous budget . \nclearly no expense was spared . \n',1
'naturally , at the core of leon gast\'s \" when we were kings \" is the fight itself , for what a fight it was . \nthanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . \nfans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore . \nwith the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life . \nbut \" when we were kings \" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match . \nquestions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary . \ngast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali . \na member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast\'s film with a forceful swipe at the united states . \nwhen ali hollers \" damn america\' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind . \nhis decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : \" no viet cong ever called me nigger \" , ali reasons . \ndespite showcasing ali\'s proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of \" when we were kings \" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion . \nlistening to the film\'s numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this \" rumble in the jungle \" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map . \nspike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a \" coming home \" to africa . \nforeman reminds us that africa is the \" cradle of civilisation \" . \nfair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality . \nit is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator . \nwhile ali respects mobutu\'s ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers . \nmailer\'s insights are lost on most of the film\'s commentators . \ngeorge plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire . \nwith admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire\' s squalid ruling elite . \nmobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power . \ndon king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the \" messiah \" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity . \nunderstandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal . \nhe may be , as one sympathiser notes , \" blacker \" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king . \nafrica , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity . \nlittle wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali\'s opponent wasn\'t white . \nadmittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored . \nthe audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time . \nthere is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified . \nthe excitement of james brown and b . b king in concert , for instance . \nand of course there\'s always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - \" we gonna get it on coz we don\'t get along ! \" . \ndoubtlessly , considering the multi-faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of \" when we were kings \" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention . \nfortunately , by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter , they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event . \n',1
'in one scene from \" the people vs . \nlarry flynt , \" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally . \nas graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity . \nthe spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in \" patton \" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag . \nboth scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies . \noverall , that sums up \" the people vs . \nlarry flynt . \" \nthe film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie . \nthe son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati . \nthere he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . \nto bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . \nflynt , along with the magazine\'s rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody\'s real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . \nthey mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on \" what guys really want , \" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . \nthe film\'s prime example of hustler\'s attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt\'s \" naughtiness . \" \ndirector milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine\'s frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons . \nflynt\'s rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives . \nan obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law . \nlawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt\'s wife . \nnorton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt\'s increasingly childish and bizarre behavior . \nin court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . ) \nas keating blathers about flynt\'s immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud . \nflynt\'s other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse . \ntragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down . \na dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers . \nflynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids . \nafter watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film\'s climactic courtroom scene . \n \" the people vs , larry flynt \" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt . \n \" if they\'ll protect a scumbag like me , then they\'ll protect all of you , \" declared flynt . \nhe\'s right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons . \nhe also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt . \nharrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero . \neven a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man . \nan accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one . \ndespite its flaws , \" flynt \" is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod . \nthe story may be candy-coated , but it\'s still delicious candy . \n',1

you say about jackie chan that hasn\'t already been said . \nsince the release of \'rumble in the bronx \" back in 1996 ( the u . s . release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america\'s video shelves . \nhaving made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west . \nhis latest release , \" shanghai noon \" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western . \nand by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( \" the western gets a kick in the pants \" ) rings true . \njackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china . \nthe royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture . \nunwilling to follow her father\'s wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america . \nbut this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess\' kidnapping and ransom . \nunable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city\'s bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada . \nchon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a

being a bandit will bring him . \nwith his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang\'s uncle . \nchon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert . \nas the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang . \nburied up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out . \nchon demands to know where carson city is . \nroy directs him , and chon leaves . \nbut not before sticking two chopsticks into roy\'s mouth and telling him to dig himself . \nchon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy . \n \" shanghai noon \" is just good fun . \nthe chemistry between the cast is remarkable . \nthe performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film . \njackie\'s performance is as good as anything he\'s done before . \nhe\'s not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth . \nbut jackie\'s natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . \nowen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of \" the haunting \" , gives a good natured performance as roy o\'bannon . \nhis innocence is refreshing and fun . \na bad guy that\'s not really bad . \nhis scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis . \nlucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant . \nthe character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . \nthe rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . \nnothing here is realistic , mind you . \n \" shanghai noon \" is first and foremost a light , jovial film . \nand the performances match that style with ease . \nthe cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . \nusing calgary , alberta as the prime location . \nmr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . \nnothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . \nand as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . \nhomage to such films as \" high noon \" ( obviously ) , \" red river \" and most notably \" butch cassidy & the sundance kid \" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . \nit is a comforting experience . \nat a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . \nhere is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . \nthis is the purest \" horse opera \" since the days of george o\'brian or john wayne . \ndirector tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood\'s past . \nin this , his first film

it should be , when jackie chan is your star . \nand what of the action and stunts . \nwell , while not up to a level of \" drunken master 2 \" or any of jackie\'s hong kong films , \" shanghai noon \" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . \nhis timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . \njackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . \nfinally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . \nto sum up , \" shanghai noon \" is a fun summer confection . \nnot too heavy and not too light . \na fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be

'did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? \nthat is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . \nshe is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . \nthe dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer\'s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . \njeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . \nhe is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . \nhis remorse for his wife\'s comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . \nthe background to the case is such . \nduring christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . \nthe same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . \nwhen examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . \nclaus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . \nhe immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . \nron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . \nwe follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn\'t commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn\'t figured out . \ndershowitz doesn\'t know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . \nnevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . \ntogether with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . \nsilver\'s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . \nschroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . \nthere are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . \nyet , due to glenn close\'s troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . \nthe flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn\'t fill in the blanks . \nthe movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . \nthe film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . \nthe supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz\'s team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . \nyet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . \nas von bulow , he is brutally evil . \nanti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . \nirons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . \nhe is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . \nhowever , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . \nthere is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife\'s death by years of neglect and coldness . \nhowever , legally , did he do the murder ? \nschroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . \nwith all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . \nschroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . \nfor all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . \nwe don\'t know what happened . \nthat sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow\'s obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . \nin the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . \nirons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good . \n',1

'the characters in \" palmetto \" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie , and it\'s just the right way to capture the film\'s ripe atmosphere of sensuality , tension and even farce . \nthis humid florida-set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself , which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke . \nas far as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven\'t seen before , but be patient -- \" palmetto \" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don\'t see coming . \nit\'s not a classic by any means , but it sure is quite an engaging surprise . \nharry barber ( woody harrelson ) is fresh out of prison , where he\'s served a couple of years for a crime he didn\'t commit . \neven though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials , harry\'s first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) . \nwhile searching for work , he catches the eye of rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire . \nrhea proposes a scheme that\'ll get harry $50 , 000 easy -- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny ) . \n \" you do like risks , don\'t you , mr . barber ? \" \nrhea alluringly coos . \nboys , form a line behind me . \npart of \" palmetto \" \'s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue , who demonstrates here that her oscar-nominated turn in \" leaving las vegas \" might merely be foreshadowing great things to come . \nshue\'s a seductive , campy delight , and pulls off a barbara stanwyck-gloria swanson combo with admirable relish . \nthe other actors form a solid ensemble around her , including sevigny ( \" kids \" ) , tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease , as well as the ever-likeable gershon , cast a far cry from her extreme roles in \" bound \" and \" showgirls . \" \nharrelson is still doing fine follow-up work to \" the people vs . larry flynt . \" \n \" palmetto \" does have its share of grievances . \nharrelson\'s narration is needless , i suppose , and gershon\'s nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is . \none of the plot\'s unexpected angles -- that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he\'s involved -- could have been played a little better . \nthere are moments when you question the tone , but it\'s never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it\'s been receiving from most other critics . \nif \" palmetto \" didn\'t want to be laughed at , would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live-action \" who framed roger rabbit \" ? \nalthough a few elements can be questioned , the movie works well on its own terms . \nthanks to a juicy cast -- especially shue -- and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff ( you remember him from last summer\'s suddenly re-popular \" the tin drum , \" right ? ) , \neverything runs smoothly . \nand for fans of revelation-heavy endings , this film\'s got a few shocks in store that i won\'t even dream of revealing . \n \" palmetto \" is a generous amount of fun to watch , and that\'s all you need to know . \n',1
'zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don\'t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . \nzero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he\'d like to think so ) . \nhowever , he\'s a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . \nzero\'s accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a \" normal \" guy who does the business side of the job -- he\'s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero\'s greatness as an investigator . \nthe opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero\'s talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o\'neal ) . \nit turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . \nzero takes the case , and the plot thickens . \nhis path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . \ndespite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . \nthrough his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . \ni have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . \ni can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown\'s greatness ) . \nzero effect , which is jake kasdan\'s first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it\'s an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . \nwith so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . \nbut he didn\'t just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . \ntake , for starters , the great cast of characters . \npullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven\'t seen from him since spaceballs . \nzero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he\'s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \npullman\'s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he\'s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he\'s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \n \" i\'ll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \no\'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \nkasdan\'s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \nit\'s the kind of humor that\'s funny even after you\'ve seen it five or six times . \nthere\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \ni can\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \nas a side note , i don\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \ni have a feeling the humor here won\'t appeal to everyone , but there\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone\'s interest . \njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \nzero effect is the kind of film that i\'ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \nand , with kasdan\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \n',1

'let\'s face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was \" goldeneye \" was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , \" a view to a kill \" or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing . \nbut it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . \nthe new \" m \" is a woman ) . \n \" tomorrow never dies \" is the picture \" goldeneye \" should have been ; it\'s also the most entertaining bond outing since \" the spy who loved me \" . \nthe new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine . \nas an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media . \ncarver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars\' german scientist from \" dr . \nstrangelove \" ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) . \nit\'s up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women . \nenter michelle yeoh , fresh from \" supercop \" , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . \nthey make a great team . \n \" tomorrow never dies \" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of \" turner & hooch \" . \nspottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in \" goldeneye \" . \nmoreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . \nreturned in brosnan\'s eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv\'s \" remington steele \" , as has his deadpan wit . \nand though carver\'s motives are muddy ( when carver explains that \" genius is insanity with some success \" , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain . \nin the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . \nthere a few too many explosions in \" tomorrow never dies \" , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . \nand it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here . \nas it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i\'m not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . \nnow that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . . \nit\'s time to put them to use in something truly special . \nthere\'s no mistaking , however , that \" tomorrow never dies \" is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you\'ll walk out wanting more bond movies . \n-reviewed december 17 , 1997 \n',1
'contact ( pg ) there\'s a moment late in robert zemeckis\'s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . \nwe see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . \nanticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \nit is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \njodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \nand i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie\'s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \nafter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \nfrom this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \nthe alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \nthe irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \nit would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \nin the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \nthe complex role of ellie is an actress\'s dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \nshe conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \nwe root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \ncontact is clearly foster\'s vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \nmatthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film\'s weakest subplot ) . \njohn hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \nhadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \nangela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \nmost memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \nzemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \nalways known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact\'s visual effects are quite stunning . \nthe central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis\'s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick\'s yet more wondrously pure . \nand zemeckis doesn\'t resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \neffects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \nit says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it\'s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \nthe thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn\'t entertaining . \nfor all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it\'s being sold as-- \" a journey to the heart of the universe . \" \nand what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is . \n',1
'having not seen , \" who framed roger rabbit \" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . \nwatching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . \naside from the fact that it\'s a milestone in animation in movies ( it\'s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it\'s also quite an effective comedy/mystery . \nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . \nthe story begins in hollywood in 1947 . \ncartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . \nmaroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger\'s mind back on work . \nmaroon thinks that roger\'s wife , jessica\'s , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . \nvaliant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake\' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . \nupon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . \nthe rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger\'s good name . \nalong the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who\'s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . \' \n`who framed roger rabbit\' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . \ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . \nalso bob hoskins\' performance should be credited . \nhe , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . \naccording to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . \n`who framed roger rabbit\' is a rare film . \none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . \ndo yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . \" \n',1
'confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind . \ni don\'t know why , really . \nhaven\'t wanted to check it out on video , haven\'t been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen . \nso right up front , i\'ll admit that i don\'t know what the heck i\'m talking about , but here goes . . . \nis titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990\'s ? \nmaybe that\'s going a little bit too far . \nas good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they\'re no clark gable and vivien leigh . \nbut . . . \nthe parallels are there . \ngwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor . \ntitanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors . \ngwtw places america\'s greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic\'s most legendary tragedy . \nthey both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . . \nok , maybe that\'s not enough parallels . \nso titanic\'s not in gwtw\'s league . \nno matter . \ntitanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills . \nmuch has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again . \nthe money was obviously well-spent . \nthe costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great . \ni especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks . \nbut writer/director/producer james cameron\'s real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn\'t just costuming and set design and special effects . \ncameron\'s major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in . \nhe succeeds masterfully . \ncameron does two things that work incredibly well . \nfirst , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that\'s just \" titanic \" , not \" the titanic \" , mind you ) . \nthe first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) . \ntelevision coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 . \nstuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew . \nsecondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) . \nthe way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people . \ncameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board . \nthe supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there\'s no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what\'s he been in . \n ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . ) \nthe love story itself is rather conventional . \ni think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism . \nthe performances are the key here . \nzane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt . \nhe\'s smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he\'s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible . \nat the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not \" can i save this little girl ? \" , \nbut \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" \ndicaprio is a revelation . \ni hadn\'t seen him before in anything , and didn\'t know what the heck to expect , really . \n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it\'s hard not to like him . \nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \nwinslet\'s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \nat first , she\'s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \nwe know from the narration that she\'s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn\'t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \nit\'s at that moment where winslet\'s character really comes alive . \nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal\'s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain\'s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \ncameron\'s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \n',1
'i\'ve always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes . \noddly , i\'ve never given much thought to either of the two . \nmaybe if i did , at least i\'d stop getting collection notices from uncle sam . \nyes , let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping , hold on to all my receipts , and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties . \nit seems that the issue of death may not be so different , at least envisioned here in this film . \nas this tender love story goes , if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die , you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty . \nthe dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true . \nfor those who die with a burdened soul , however , they wind up in that other place . \nchris and annie ( a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra ) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer . \ntheir love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable . \nbut tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie\'s happiness . \nand when chris dies after a terrible car accident , she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself . \ndespair is perhaps the greatest sin , and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity . \nchris , on the other hand , has made it to heaven , and upon learning of annie\'s fate , he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare . \nthis film brims with imagination , containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell . \nit seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares . \nit\'s shape and look is as infinite as our imagination . \nas chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous , he also begins to learn more about himself . \ncertain questions baffle him at first . \nwhy does his home in heaven ooze with paint ? \nwhat is the significance of the asian stewardess ? \nwhy does he have an all-too-willing guide ( cuba gooding , jr . ) to help him find annie ? \nbut as he slowly begins to realize the answers , it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie . \n \" dreams \" is both visually and tellingly beautiful . \nalas , i have one regret . \nthe movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed , but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying . \nit seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish , but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments . \nhowever , your eyes will still well up with tears and you\'ll find lots to savor . \nthe storytelling is purposeful and well constructed . \nthe journey is imaginative . \nand i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film . \n',1
'director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . \nnicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who\'s \" pulled back in \" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis\' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . \nmemphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang . \nmemphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well . \ngone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . \nin that sequence , we get a rockin\' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects . \nfilmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . \nand what follows doesn\'t disappoint . . . \ncage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . \ngood or bad . . . \ni don\'t know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely . \nof the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis\' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she\'s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i\'ve ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis\' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . \nalso , i\'m a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . \nnone of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately . \nsome underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles . \ndelroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo\'s partner . \ni just wish some of the other characters could have been as important . \nthe only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . . \nmainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll . \nthere\'s no doubt in anyone\'s mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the \" rival car thief \" plot line . \nas it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package . \nbut if i was making this film , i\'d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . \nthereby adding some meat to the plot . \nthe finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren\'t ways to make car chases interesting anymore . \nit\'s all been done . \nthe chase is also shot and edited in that \" jerry bruckheimer action sequence \" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . \nsure it\'s a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? \nit\'s very hard to tell . \nfinally , there\'s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the \" bus jumping the ramp \" sequence from speed in the \" oh , i don\'t think so . . . \" \ndepartment . \ndespite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment . \nit\'s not thought provoking , but it\'s shiny , loud and fun . . . \njust what a summer flick should be . \n[pg-13] \n',1

'star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \nreview by matt pusateri \nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\' 1977 classic , star wars . \nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \none of the reasons the film\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \nit\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \nbut it\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\'s story or obi-wan\'s . \nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\'s a shaky foundation . \nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \neach location is elaborate and complex . \nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\'t possible when the films were made . \nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\'s accidental sidekick . \njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\'t completely convincing . \nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \nyou accept that he\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\'t mind him at all . \na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \ndespite all the film\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\'s destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \nfortunately , lucas hasn\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \nthe phantom menace won\'t win any major oscars . \nit probably won\'t beat titanic\'s box office record . \nand it\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \nbut it\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe film can\'t live up to it\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \nbut it\'s still worth seeing . . . \nprobably more than once . \n',1
'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nanalyze this \nhow does one do a comedy focused on the mob ? \nwell , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia ! \nfailed to really get the joke . \nthis time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets more than it misses . . . and \nfor plenty of reasons . \nthe story goes like this . \na mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting . \nit\'s these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who\'s mostly reluctant to take the mobster\'s case for two reasons . \nfirst , of course , he\'s a mobster , but secondly , he\'s trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid . \nand , of course , he can\'t rest worth for a moment because the mobster\'s goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation . \nfortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs . \ndirector harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which wasn\'t half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it\'s sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings can\'t always be taken for laughs , you know ) . \ndeniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart . \n ( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . ) \ncrystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro\'s character , uplifting him from such bombs as father\'s day and my giant . \nkudrow is also a hoot as crystal\'s wife-to-be , who\'s on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro\'s presence . \nis the movie perfect ? \nnot really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he\'s a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy . \nkudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either . \nline of the movie : crystal : \" when you said you needed family therapy , this is not the family i had in mind ! \" \n',1

'labelling is sometimes everything . \nin original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . \nwalter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . \nproducers weren\'t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . \non the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . \nto make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . \ninstead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . \nthe gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . \nthat is far away from warriors\' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . \non the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . \ncrowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . \npolice simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . \nthe remaining eight , led by cleon\'s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . \nupon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . \nhowever , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . \nthe reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . \nif walter hill\'s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . \nthe future was much worse than his vision . \nthe youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . \ntheir members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . \nin their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . \nthey even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . \nmany people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . \nsome of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . \ndespite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . \nthe plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . \nthe fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn\'t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . \nediting is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . \nthe soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . \nyet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . \nbest known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . \nmichael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . \nall in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . \n',1
'`strange days\' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles . \nas the locals gear up for the new millenium , lenny nero ( ralph fiennes ) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips . \nhe pines for his ex-girlfriend , faith ( juliette lewis ) , not noticing that another friend , mace ( angela bassett ) really cares for him . \nthis film features good performances , impressive film-making technique and breath-taking crowd scenes . \ndirector kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it . \nbut as a whole , this is an unsatisfying movie . \nthe problem is that the writers , james cameron and jay cocks , were too ambitious , aiming for a film with social relevance , thrills , and drama . \nnot that ambitious film-making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals , it fails badly and obviously . \nthe film just ends up preachy , unexciting and uninvolving . \n',1
'very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . \nthey are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . \nyou may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . \nin beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . \nbeavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . \nthey live their lives in front of the television . \nthe worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . \nthis happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . \nbeavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . \nthe two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . \neven at this point they have no idea what has happened . \nthey look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . \nbefore the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn\'t realise just how stupid . \nthis is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . \neventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . \nluck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . \nthis man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they \" do his wife \" . \nbeavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . \nthey are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to \" do her \" . \nto them , this is the best day of their lives . \nnot only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . \ninevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . \noddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . \nthey end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . \nthe irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . \nat old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . \nbeavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives . \nthey even get to meet the president . \nbut all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . \nthis is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it\'s unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . \nthe humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . \nin the end you can\'t help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television . \nin this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . \nif you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . \notherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . \none note of warning : don\'t take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you\'ll \nnever hear the end of it ! \n',1
'the \" italian hitchcock \" and acknowledged master of the giallo murder-mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena . \nthis time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino ( jennifer connelly ) , a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects . \nsent to a girls boarding school in switzerland , she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school\'s population terrified . \na chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist ( donald pleasance ) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift . \nphenomena is an imaginative , original thriller . \nwriter/director argento creates several sequences of surreal , haunting beauty here , including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer\'s beckoning . \nthe plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer\'s identity is genuinely shocking and surprising . \nthe director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden , ex-rolling stone bill wyman , and argento\'s favourite gothic/electronic outfit goblin . \nbut it gels surprisingly well . \nthe film\'s opening music reccurs several times , an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone . \nargento fans beware : the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re-titled as creepers . \nthis deleted nearly half an hour of footage , mainly of key dialogue scenes . \n',1
'oliver stone\'s latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . \nit\'s a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . \nstone doesn\'t hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . \nthe director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . \nat the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal . \nhe is simply trying to tame it . \nbut the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president\'s ability to control them . \nstone doesn\'t in any way apologize for nixon . \nhe blames not only nixon\'s own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own . \n \" nixon \" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . \nthere\'s something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking . \nsir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president . \njoan allen\'s magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette . \nshe is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . \nthe rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins . \neveryone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing . \nstone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined . \nhe is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . \nat times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon\'s youth and childhood . \nthe flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson\'s rich cinematography and john williams\' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . \nthe film\'s only fault is that it\'s a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . \nstill it\'s an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making . \n',1
'the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily . \nthree filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making . \nthey disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house . \nfrom there , things become a little more complicated . \ni can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me . \nalthough i know it was all a staged \" mockumentary \" , there\'s no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you . \ni didn\'t feel much upon initially watching it . \ni just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts . \ni never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend . \ni\'ve gotten chills every time i\'ve brought it up since then . \nthis is not a movie that hits you right away . \ninstead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it\'s way up into your mind . \nthis is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch . \nthe film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don\'t expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work . \nthis is as real as it gets folks . \ni don\'t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera . \nthe performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not . \nthis is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera . \nthe reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen . \nword has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release . \ni urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd\'s . \ni know i\'ll be first in line to buy one . \n[r] \n',1
'ok , let\'s get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it\'s not too bad , really . \nit\'s the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo\'s maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . \nin lam\'s film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . \nthese russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn\'t be noticed ) . \nthis brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , \nyou know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don\'t have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . \nmoreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . \nin little odessa , he meets mikhail\'s girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . \nthis film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . \nafter all , one thing that\'s been missing from woo\'s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . \nmovies like this shouldn\'t be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \" big \" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . \nmaximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don\'t overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . \nthe emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don\'t make a hell of a lot of sense ) . \nin fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv\'s \" kids in the hall \" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . \nunfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , \nyou\'ll see . \nthe movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . \none is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . \nanother , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . \nand even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . \nof course , the movie does have its share of silliness . \nfor example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he\'s getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . \nin an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . \nbut what has he become ? \na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \ndoesn\'t sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \nbut let\'s face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there\'s not much left . \nalthough it\'s short on spectacle , lam\'s film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \ni\'m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that\'s a good sign . \ngo see maximum risk , but don\'t expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \ndr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don\'t hold this against him . \n',1
'swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . \nsteven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . \nand he knows a money making winner when he sees one . \nthe mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . \nhopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . \na fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . \nthe film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . \nhowever , he\'s far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . \nbanderas motive ? \nto avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . \nwith the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . \nbanderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro\'s , playing each other off with ease . \nhopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . \nas the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . \nthe audience does hate them , which can\'t be bad . \ncatherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . \nthe chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . \nthere\'s a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . \nthe director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . \nthe action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well . \nthe cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding . \nalthough the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there\'s barely a dull moment . \nhowever , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . \nit manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . \nscreenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . \nalthough they\'ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . \nthere\'s lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there\'s nothing substantial to bring them all together . \nthe main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to \'buy\' california using gold stolen from the guy he\'s buying the land off . \nthis sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . \nhowever , this doesn\'t seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it\'s going . \nin the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . \nit suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . \nyou won\'t regret it . \n',1

'mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there\'s a new critter in town , and he\'s the nameless animal attraction of \" mouse hunt , \" dreamworks skg\'s clever first foray into family fare . \nalthough it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney\'s entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog . . . \nbut consider that list includes dismal tripe like \" air bud , \" \" flubber \" and \" that darn cat , \" and it\'s really not such a difficult feat to pull off . \nstill , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i\'ll be hoping that the mouse from \" mouse hunt \" knocks some sense back into mickey . \nnathan lane ( robin williams\' significant other from \" the birdcage \" ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in \" the fifth element \" ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion . \nalthough lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect . \nbut there\'s a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he\'s not about to give up his place of residence without a fight . \nmovies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite . \nthe effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless . \nthe splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton\'s mind ; the smuntz\'s architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of \" the nightmare before christmas , \" and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price\'s warped contraptions from \" edward scissorhands . \" \n \" mouse hunt \" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it\'s hardly ever mean-spirited . \nthe star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse . \nit\'s lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans\' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie\'s more flashy physical shtick . \nvicki lewis ( beth from \" newsradio \" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars\' money-grubbing wife . \nand in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a \" calcium deficiency . \" \nblech . \na basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution . \ntheir sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don\'t think i\'ll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that\'s okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share . \n \" mouse hunt \" may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original \" home alone . \" \n',1
'scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption . \nal pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami . \noliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles . \nthe film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states . \nmany of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime . \nnearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry . \nalong with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field . \ntony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank\'s lover . \nof course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force . \nthis is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami . \ntony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone , and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him . \nno one can trust him , and basically , no one does . \nscarface , although incredibly violent , is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino . \nalthough he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance , it truly is a very good one . \nin fact , his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination ( although he did get a golden globe nomination ) . \nanother element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity . \na figure tagged to the film boasts that the word \" fuck \" and it\'s uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film , which is apparently a record . \nthe thing is , the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie . \nas odd as it sounds , it\'s true . \nin the end , scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard . \n',1
' \" six days , seven nights \" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . \nhere\'s a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it\'s fluff , recognizes it\'s fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . \nof course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie\'s success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it\'s easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . \nas his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . \nthe age difference ( ford\'s 56 , heche\'s 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that\'s hard to come by . \nthe story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . \nrobin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . \nthe plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . \na series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . \nmeanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn\'s shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . \nthat subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . \nand since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . \ndirector ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . \nat a slim 101 minutes , \" six days , seven nights \" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . \nmichael browning\'s clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is \" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? \" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they\'re all quite engaging . \neven the movie\'s more \" serious \" moments are played with a wink . \nheche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the \" believability \" of \" six days , seven nights \" \' heterosexual pairing . \n ( so she\'s a lesbian . \nso what . \ndeal with it . ) \nof course it doesn\'t , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . \nin fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . \nat one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . \nafter several wrong guesses ( \" forty-five ? \n_fifty_ ? \" ) , he whispers his age to her . \n \" you still look good , \" heche stammers . \n \" i still _am_ good , \" ford replies . \nshe\'s good too , and together , they make \" six days , seven nights \" one memorable ride . \n',1
'the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination\' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons\' halloween episode . \nafter attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine . \nafter a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world . \nagain and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it . \nthe characters of `final destination\' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design\' . \nsomeone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake . \nthat someone is death . \nyou see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . . \nbut the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . \nfor a high school excursion , alex\'s french class is traveling to paris by airline transport . \nalex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air . \nin a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft . \nafter a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ?

\n`final destination\' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files\' episode than `the simpsons\' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong . \non familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination\' reflects that . \nunlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool . \nyou just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won\'t unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks . \nyoung viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer\' and sequel , `idle hands\' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend\' . \nafter the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination\' . \nlow and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent . \nsome splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream\' in 1996 . \n`final destination\' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we\'ve endured throughout the past few years . \nnot that the characters are that good . \nsawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend . \nin addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson\'s creek\' ) , carter\'s ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) . \naside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues\' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) . \nthe personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character\'s plight ! \' \ntoss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . . \n`spiritual\' mortician ( former `candyman\' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments . \nnot so . \n`final destination\' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening . \nthe extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose\' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick . \nthe plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games\' ) . \nbut i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination\' is the murder scenes . \ncreative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character\'s demise . \nwhat will trigger the accident ? \nwill it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high\' ? \n ( yeah , sick humor ) . \nwill it be the leaking toilet ? \nthe falling fishing reel in the corner ? \nthe murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward . \na sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach . \nit gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ? \nit\'s fun . \nin that simple regard , `final destination\' is my cup of tea . \nthis stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side . \nafter the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you . \nwhen will your ?

'>from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . \ninstead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . \nthe concept is deceptively pedestrian . \nan adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . \nthe movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . \nthe son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . \nfollowing one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . \nit\'s difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . \nseemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . \nwithout giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . \nand it\'s all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . \na grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . \ndrawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations . \n',1
'i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba\'s oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- \" memories of underdevelopment \" . \ni saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late \'70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition . \ni knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit . \nfellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs . \ni have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain\'t so . \nhaving some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro\'s repressiveness , i can\'t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can\'t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement . \nas kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution\'s current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident . \nthe proper questions to put relate to castro\'s legitimacy . \ni bet the film takes castro\'s power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba\'s state control , cannot question his right to run cuba\'s political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) . \nthat\'s why i just can\'t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime . \nlet\'s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up . \ni saw the film--twice . \ni was right ; castro remained intact . \nstrawberry negotiates the relationship between a young \" dialectic materialist , \" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba . \nthe young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution\'s reason for being . \ngrateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty . \ntherein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians . \ncuba\'s government is castro . \ndiego\'s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life . \nhe enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art . \nhe does not do \" voluntary work \" for the revolution . \nhis small apartment is a sensual oasis . \nthe moniker \" bourgeois \" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie . \nhowever , he is a \" revolucionario \" in his own way . \nthe supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david\'s roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david\'s ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government . \ngutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too . \nheck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor . \nhe really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws . \nreal criticism is missing though . \nthis movie is political window dressing . \nluis aguilar leon\'s op . \ned . \npiece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition . \naguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film\'s political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment . \nas art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept \" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point . \" \nalthough terrible propaganda , this is otherwise a fine film . \n',1
'losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing . \nreacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare . \nwhile we all might feel the desire to blow someone\'s head off with a shotgun when they don\'t seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid . \nthis isn\'t the case with sam baily - john travolta\'s slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city . \n \" i don\'t think people listen to guys like me , \" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum . \njust a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam\'s apprehension resulted in a brash decision . \nin an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs . banks ( blythe danner ) , to \" just listen \" , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage . \nsam\'s overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc . , his wife and two children won\'t be provided for . \nhe\'s not a lunatic or a hot-tempered madman , he\'s somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren\'t helped any by the fact that banks wasn\'t overly compassionate with the let go . \noverall , he\'s just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we\'d deem \" far enough \" as the starting mark of some crazy race . \nmeanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene . \ncovering a \" fluff \" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking news story he ever could\'ve hoped for . \nhaving been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story . \nmax immediately bonds with sam . \nmax even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone . \nat first , max\'s intentions don\'t stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him . \nthe media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill . \nthe accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam\'s honest ambitions . \nalso involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max . \nalda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities . \nthen there is mia kirshner , who plays the young tv station intern laurie . \nshe falls under max\'s wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting . \nkirshner\'s credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow . \nstill , kirshner\'s character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles . \ni wouldn\'t mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen . \nwhile the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self-righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability . \nhoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat . \nthey both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both . \nthere is quite a bit of humor in this film , and without it , it could\'ve fallen into a drab , cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause . \nthis isn\'t a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart , but it will lightly touch both , making for a recommendable movie . \nif for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time , i urge you to check this one out . \n',1
'jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . \nfor the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . \ndaryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . \nthe parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . \nhe even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . \nhowever zero\'s observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . \nhe could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . \narlo is not happy with his job . \nhe is thrilled to be around zero\'s brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . \nand they\'re even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend\'s boss means more to arlo than her . \nthis is the situation when a new case comes knocking . \ngregory stark ( ryan o\'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . \nit seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . \nnow , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . \nto solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . \nhowever , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and \nthis time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . \nfor the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . \nzero effect is weakest in its obviously \" wacky \" scenes depicting daryl zero\'s odd behavior . \nsuch scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . \nhowever , there\'s a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . \nthat\'s not to say that there\'s not a place for humor in this film . \nin fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller\'s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . \nhowever , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren\'t funny enough to stand on their own . \nonce the investigation is underway , however , zero\'s brilliance really begins to shine . \nhis lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock\'s own . \nas the mystery begins to unfold , zero\'s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . \nzero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . \nzero\'s relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . \nhowever , we are always kept distant from gloria\'s character . \nshe\'s given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . \nperhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero\'s zone of detachment . \nbut , on the whole , it is frustrating . \nbill pullman , when he\'s not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . \nthere\'s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . \nand , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called \" zero \" seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . \nalthough zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise . \n',1

coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \ni don\'t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn\'t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie\'s beginning , but there it is . \nif there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . \nthe film is told nearly first person from william\'s point of view , as he is in every scene . \nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \nin fact , much of notting hill\'s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he\'s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \nwilliam assures her he wouldn\'t say a word , then adds , \" well , i\'ll probably tell myself now and then , but i\'d never believe it . \" \ngreat stuff . \nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don\'t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \nwe\'re constantly exposed to william\'s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don\'t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we\'re not sure what she\'s been thinking all the times in between . \nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant\'s film hands down . \nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress\'s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character\'s unpredictable behavior . \nanna doesn\'t get a lot of our compassion . \nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william\'s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william\'s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister\'s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \nit\'s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \nroger michell\'s use of visuals doesn\'t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william\'s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \nwe\'re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird\'s eye view of the ground below . \nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film\'s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \nit\'s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today\'s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \nnotting hill\'s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that\'s not so bad , now is it ? \n',1
'a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today\'s youth seem attracted to black culture . \nthe review \nif black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . \nhowever , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . \nblack & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america\'s youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . \nfeaturing a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback\'s is a complex film worth seeing . \nblack & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . \nthere is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . \nthis eventually spills over into the life of dean\'s long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . \nrich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf . \nmeanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . \nothers who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean\'s girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . \nmike tyson . \nthe stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . \nfriendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . \noriginally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . \nwhile the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . \nthe three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . \nthe frequent sex is one of the film\'s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . \nto toback\'s credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . \nthese gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . \nwhenever a character finds himself on donager\'s handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . \ncharlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that \" in ten years time , i\'ll be way over this . \" \nthese youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . \ntoback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . \nmost of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film\'s comic relief without really trying . \nhe is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson\'s image as a dimwit . \nbut tyson also gets the film\'s scariest moment . \nas he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . \nthe scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . \nthe reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr\'s face turns a frightening shade of purple . \nblack & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film\'s omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . \nbut toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character\'s struggle . \nthus black & white\'s message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself . \ntoback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way . \nand we do . \n',1
'kevin smith is like a big kid . \nhis humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile\'s . \nhe grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . \nhe also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith\'s own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . \nsmith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . \nkevin smith is a better writer than director , and he\'ll be the first to tell you that . \nthat might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . \ngreat directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . \nthis was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . \nthat is not to say smith\'s message is a bad one . \nin dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god\'s desires is superior to anyone else\'s . \nbasically , dogmatism is bad . \nchanging the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . \nthis is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma\'s protesters are proving smith\'s point . \nsmith\'s own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . \nbut this is smith\'s personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . \nthe story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . \nalong the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany\'s aid . \nfallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . \nthe logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith\'s points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . \namong the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . \nof course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . \nthey are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . \nsmith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . \nwhen harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters\' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . \nthe film\'s humor is uneven . \nsome parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . \nbut many of the film\'s jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek\'s serendipity . \nalso , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . \nstill , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . \namong the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . \nfiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . \ndamon and affleck are fairly lackluster . \nrock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . \nbut the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith\'s movies , are much more in line with smith\'s brand of humor . \nbud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . \n',1
'what a great film . \nwhat a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film . \n>from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy . \na car with no brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way . \nthey mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day . \nheil ! \nheil ! \nhuh ? \nshortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . \nthis is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives . \ngranted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . \ni think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character . \nbenigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race . \nbenigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept . \nit = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema . \nthere are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly . \nslapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed . \nand although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in . \nthis is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family . \nthe second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported . \nguido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child . \nfor = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right . \nfor his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds . \nwhich raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? \nwith persecution ? \nwith injustice on the worst level ? \nit+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had . \nother times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim . \nsometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds . \nbenigni+s guido realizes this . \nhe is the clown , but he is not a fool . \nhe sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh . \nhis liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him . \nit+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor . \nperhaps that is a form of denial . \nperhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) . \nor . . . \nperhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit . \nwhatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept . \nsurprisingly , it works . \nit is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust . \nit+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it . \nthey don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more . \ni believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing . \nhowever , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target . \nbenigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) . \nhe has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society . \nit swept the italian academy awards . \ncontroversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film . \nmasterful . \nmiraculous . \na must-see . \n',1
'if there\'s one thing in common about all of hollywood\'s major studios , it\'s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it\'s obvious there\'s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \nso when a movie like gary ross\' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it\'s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross\' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \nit\'s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \nfine performances are turned in all around . \nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman\'s envy . \nfor daniels , it\'s his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it\'s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \nthere\'s not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don\'t . \n',1
'i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon . \nwhen the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn\'t hear one negative comment , and i didn\'t have any to offer . \nsimon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them . \nsimon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart . \nsurprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle . \nsimon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn\'t know what . \njoe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who\'s mom ( ashley judd ) won\'t tell him who his father is . \nsimon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don\'t really like him , because he isn\'t \" natural \" . \neven his own parents don\'t care about him , and are disappointed they didn\'t have a \" normal \" son . \nhe is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon\'s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks . \nthe only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe\'s mom , who he also looks up to as a mother . \nit would be just simon\'s luck , that he would accidentally kills joe\'s mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie . \njoe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is . \nwith the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe\'s mom\'s current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way . \nmost of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is . \nsimon will also look for god\'s plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way . \nstarring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood\'s newest dramatic actor , jim carrey . \njim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right . \nthis is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job . \nsimon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series . \nhe does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film\'s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly . \nthe dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat . \nthe cast is excellent . \njoseph mazzello gives the stand out performance . \njoseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 . \nian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation . \nother great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast . \ni loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year . \ntake your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece . \n',1
'gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit . \nin fact , they\'ve been around in books and on film for many , many years . \nwithout the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated . \n \" the gift , \" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \nit\'s fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \nthe film ultimately shouldn\'t work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he\'s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone\'s future . \nher late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . \nwhen annie\'s eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . \nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . \nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \n \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999\'s \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . \nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie\'s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999\'s \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \nblanchett isn\'t the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999\'s \" boys don\'t cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000\'s \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000\'s \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000\'s \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000\'s \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie\'s spicy best friend , linda . \nthe other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it\'s almost suffocating . \nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . \nhelped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , \" the gift \" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too . \nit may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time . \n',1
'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \nit\'s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \nwhile it\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \nbut the way we\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \nit doesn\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \nit\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \nit\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he\'s gay . \" \nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \nnaturally the questions pour from howard\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \nthe frenzy isn\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\'re up to bat . \nrudnick\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \nwhile in & out doesn\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \ndespite it\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \ncheck this one out . \nyou\'ll have a gay old time . \n',1
'capsule : the best place to start if you\'re a jackie chan newcomer . \nroars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious . \nto talk about jackie chan as a \" stuntman \" is to miss a million things . \njackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy . \nhe reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he\'s funny just standing there , copping a look . \nsupercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene . \nit\'s actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it . \n ( the others are also worth seeing . ) \nit\'s a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it\'s a field day . \nthe movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind . \nkevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) . \nthere\'s a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform . \nkevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss . \nthe drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife\'s on trial for many of his own crimes , and she\'s got the key to an account with all of his drug funds . \nthis means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he\'s out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that\'s one of the movie\'s unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly . \naction . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! ) \noutrunning the hong kong coast guard . \nthere is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the \'copter as well as a motorcycle . \nyou get the idea . \nthis is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable , filling . \nwatch it with friends . \nwhen they stop making movies like this , the world will be a tad greyer . \n',1
'this summer , one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham\'s series , a time to kill , was made into a major motion picture . \non january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi . \nbased on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars\' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband\'s obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed . \nso she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven\'s prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member . \nghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history , from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960\'s . \nbut all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like \" what\'s america got to do with anything ? \nthis is mississippi ! \" \nas beckwith , james woods , with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man , teeters between portraying evil and its character . \nmeanwhile , goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn\'t let her husband\'s death rest until she got the conviction . \nboth deserve serious oscar-consideration . \nthis brings us to the dull performance of baldwin . \nlet\'s face it , trying to match matthew mcconaughey\'s wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible . \nand baldwin is living proof of this , as no emotions could be felt . \nit seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear . \neither poor acting or poor directing , but something definitely went wrong . \nanother strange mishap was the fact that goldberg\'s facial features didn\'t change , as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband\'s dead body 25-years earlier . \nyet woods\' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg\'s father . \nat least the make-up was realistic . \nwith some emotional moments in the poorly written script , ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart , when its predecessor , a time to kill , brought tears to everyone\'s eyes . \ndon\'t get me wrong , the movie wasn\'t all that bad , but if you\'ve seen grisham\'s masterpiece , then don\'t expect this one to be an excellent film . \n , \n',1
'satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \n \" dr . \nstrangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \n \" men in black \" ) . \nwhat\'s unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn\'t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \nif there\'s anything that affects americans the most it\'s politics and showbusiness . \nin this age of information and technology , we\'ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it\'s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn\'t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \nthat\'s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president\'s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \nbrean , along with the president\'s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \nthey pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it\'s a country no one\'s heard of so they people will buy it ) . \nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film\'s riffing satire comes into play . \nwe\'re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \nthe characters\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean\'s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \nsince it\'s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \nthis demonstrates the film\'s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \nbut then there\'s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress\'s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" \nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it\'s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . \nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \nthen again , it\'s a valiant effort . \n',1
'i know that \" funnest \" isn\'t a word . \n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that\'s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i\'ve ever seen ! \" \nso to hell with webster\'s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i\'ve seen in a while . \ni can\'t remember the last time i\'ve seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy\'s farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n',1
'curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won\'t appeal to everyone . \nto be specific , let me give you an example . \ndo you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? \nif you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don\'t see curdled . \non the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . \nour film\'s heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . \nluckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . \nthe killer\'s nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he\'s played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . \none particularly striking m . o . \non the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . \ngabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . \nshe immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . \nno points for guessing what they do . \nher workmates are confused by gabriela\'s fascination with murder ; to them , it\'s just a day job . \nthere\'s a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . \ngabriela\'s partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela\'s wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer\'s latest scene - they\'re the messiest , you see . \nunbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he\'s also heading over there . . \nthe comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . \napparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . \nthere are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who\'s probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . \nthat role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . \njones is great in curdled - she\'s wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character\'s innocence or likeability . \nshe can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . \nit\'s a great performance . \nreb braddock\'s direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . \nthe best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . \nthe opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . \nof course , it\'s impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you\'re not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . \nthe one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . \nwhile its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . \ncurdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . \nit\'ll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . \n',1
'as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous . \nalmost everyone knows it , well at least in north america . \nso it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . \nit has been done before with varying results . \nthis version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . \nthe basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . \nthere is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . \nafter the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . \n . \nunlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . \nthe ? prince\' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets \'cinderella\' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . \nalthough this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . \nthe story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . \nthis addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . \nfor example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . \nfor instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . \nespecially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . \nthe characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women . \nalthough the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . \nthe nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . \nas a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . \nbut , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . \nthe actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . \nthe acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . \nall in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land . \nbut , don\'t get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . \nso although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing \n',1
'in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80\'s . \nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \nyou\'d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \nin wonder boys his performance isn\'t showy or a tour de force , it\'s simple yet truthful . \nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \nhe\'s portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he\'s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady\'s pants . \nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it\'s because i\'m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas\'s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i\'m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . \nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . \nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \nhe\'s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that\'s part of its charm . \nand maybe i\'m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i\'m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \ni\'m privy to films about literary types i . e . \nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that\'s a problem i wish i found with films more often . \nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn\'t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin\' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \nit\'s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \n',1
'one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting . \nthe main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone . \nthey attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey . \ncarver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there . \nwhen nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life . \nscrewer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients . \ndr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore\'s financial backing . \nhowever , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug . \nthe performances are all very commendable . \nsid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role . \nkenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital . \njoan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey . \ncharles hawtrey plays an \'out-of-character\' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch . \nsome critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters . \nas a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part . \nother regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring \'matron\' ) and barbara windsor as nookey\'s love interest and unofficial \'women\'s lib\' campaigner , goldie locks . \nboth jacques and windsor play their parts well . \npatsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from \'steptoe and son\' fame ) and peter butterworth . \nthe jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they\'re doing . \nalthough it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors . \na must-see carry on movie . \n',1
'i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams\' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality . \nbut darn it , `music of the heart\' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations . \nit\'s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it\'s manipulation . \nin addition , it\'s also a terrific family film . \nthis is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools . \nit could also be described as `mrs . \nstreep\'s opus\' . \nyes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad . \nout of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta\'s character and grasp her academic point-of-view . \nshe is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? \nslowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied . \none thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart\' lies with the unlikely presence in the director\'s chair : horror veteran wes craven . \nafter leaving an impression with the `scream\' films and the original `nightmare on elm street\' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama . \nat first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material . \nit doesn\'t carry the heart-warming courage of `mr . \nholland\'s opus\' , but `music of the heart\' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth . \nthe tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate . \nyes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it\'s the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart\' work . \nangela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn\'t hire roberta because of her lack of experience . \nblue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest . \ngloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force . \nit\'s like a schoolteacher\'s version of `thelma and louise\' , in a restrained but effective manner . \nthe movie tackles more issues than just guaspari\'s teaching of violin . \nthere\'s some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman . \nin it\'s dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth . \nit\'s a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision . \nit\'s commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal . \nwatching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream\' ? \nof course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart\' ? \nmission accomplished , wes . \nthankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film . \nin it\'s entirety , it\'s a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile . \nthe child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme . \nthe mother who doesn\'t want her son to be learning `white man\'s music\' , the unexpected casuality . . . \nbasically everything is there . \nit doesn\'t strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart\' is highly convincing . \nthe uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart\' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals . \n',1

'if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . \nalthough some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle\'s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \nuntil that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \ncontemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \none of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin\'s to live and die in l . a . \nthe money isn\'t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \nrick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \nrichard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \nhowever , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . \nfinally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . \nbeing frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . \ntheir plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . \nlike french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin\'s movie was inspired by real life . \ngerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . \nthat turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \nsecret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie\'s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan\'s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \nultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \nwillem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn\'t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \ncompared with him , and all the other side characters that want their \" piece of the action \" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . \ninstead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those \" better judgement \" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . \nin such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn\'t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . \nthe dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin\'s directing skills . \nthe tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \nthat scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . \nthe soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band \" wang chung \" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . \nin every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . \n',1
'capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen . \none viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse . \nthe idea is something about ghosts and the internet . \nthe film has an amazing apocalyptic style . \n , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nperhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) \nfilmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa . \nhis films all seem to have one style , bleak . \nthe worlds he creates are terrifying and cold . \nlittle known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver . \nmost of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid . \nhis 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with . \ncure is probably his classic . \nlast year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon . \nthat was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story . \npulse is kurosawa back on form . \ntaguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software . \ntwo co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment . \ntaguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software . \nmeanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain . \nwhen he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself . \nif that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall . \ntaguchi\'s computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus . \npeople whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide . \nbut they are not entirely dead . \ntheir spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet . \npeople who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost . \nif they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow . \nthe computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist . \nthis is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing \" like a computer disk . \" \ninstead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses . \nthere is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers . \nleave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death . \nthis is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work . \nit may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish . \nkurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . \nfrequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . \nhis plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . \njunichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa\'s films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone . \nimages are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . \nscenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . \npeople are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . \nseeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . \nkurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . \nof any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . \ni rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n',1
