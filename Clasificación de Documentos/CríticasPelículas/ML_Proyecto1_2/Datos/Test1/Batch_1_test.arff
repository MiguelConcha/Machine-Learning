" Quantum of Solace: Action. Starring Daniel Craig, Mathieu Amalric and Olga Kurylenko. Directed by Marc Forster. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) If you were expecting a series of James Bond masterpieces, you will be disappointed by Quantum of Solace. After the heights of Casino Royale, the series falls back into routine with this above-average thriller, filled with over-the-top action, familiar Bond atmosphere and a story that's impossible to follow - and why bother anyway? Daniel Craig is still the coolest man in the universe. That definitely helps. Oh, but what a rotten life this James Bond has. Remember Sean Connery, and how he made being a secret agent seem like a great job? Remember Roger Moore, almost bursting out of his tuxedo with self-satisfaction, waiting to tell somebody, anybody, that his name was Bond, James Bond? These guys loved their work, and they made you think, gee, I'd like to do that, too.  But no one would want to endure the trials that poor Daniel Craig has to go through in Quantum of Solace: A car chase, a car wreck, drive-by shootings, crashing through roofs, not to mention an upside-down duel-to-the-death while hanging from a rope ... and I'm only talking about the first 15 minutes. Ask audiences who see Quantum of Solace if they'd rather dig ditches for a living or be James Bond, and you know what they'd say: They'd ask if the ditch-digging job came with benefits.  Perhaps this is the right Bond for our time: sullen, pessimistic and putting in extra hours, besides. Of course, this Bond is not merely somber out of his disposition or philosophical inclination. No, Vesper is dead. Remember Vesper (Eva Green), from the previous movie? Within the constraints of the action genre, this revitalized series actually cares about the psychological truthfulness of the Bond character. And so, in a wise move, we meet Bond in the aftermath of the last movie. Bond has lost the love of his life. He is sad and, even worse, disillusioned, because he believes that she betrayed him. He is also still in Italy. We meet him as he drives south from Venice in his inimitable style (firing an automatic weapon out the window). Still looking crisp in his suit, he arrives in Siena just in time for the annual Palio, the horse race that takes place in the town square every summer. He doesn't get to watch the spectacle. He spends the race interrogating a prisoner and then chasing a defector through a medieval underground labyrinth. The setting is appropriate. James Bond's lot is to be a modern man in collision with the medieval sensibility - the deceit, the cloak-and-dagger stuff, and the dark back alleys, both of cities and of the mind. Quantum of Solace almost never slows down. It should slow down more than it does. It provides no moments to savor, no memorable interludes, no scenes between characters to speak of, and no lines of pithy dialogue to look back on fondly. In overall feeling, it's not unlike the middle film in a trilogy. We're thrown right into the action. There's lots of commotion throughout. And it ends, not prematurely, and yet without a feeling of absolute completion.  The new Bond girl (Olga Kurylenko) is lackluster. Actually, she doesn't have much of a showcase. Bond is too busted up over Vesper to pay her much attention. Mathieu Amalric, as the latest villain, has a snide panache, but he would have been more effective had the script made it clear why he's so evil. Something to do with oil? Something to do with the water supply? He's a little too vague to be terrifying.  Still, three major elements tip this movie's balance into the plus column. There is, first of all, the ineffable Bondness of a Bond movie. This can't be discounted. When Bond walks through a barren rocky landscape, wearing a tuxedo and a bloody shirt, accompanied by a beautiful young woman, the tableau lights up the mind with memories of other movies. This might be the least glamorous Bond movie ever made, but in its style, its visuals and its production, it feels like one of the series. That's important.  On a more tangible level, Quantum of Solace benefits from imaginatively conceived action sequences and from a director, Marc Forster, who knows how to film them. Instead of lazily relying on a shaky camera to impart excitement, Forster uses montage. His shots are quick and artfully assembled. Take a look at the opening car chase, which gains all its energy through vigorous cutting. This is a director willing to do the actual work of building a sequence. Finally, there's Craig, who is at least the franchise's second-best Bond, a real actor who imparts a depth of meaning to seemingly throwaway lines. The filmmakers take care of the trappings. They make Craig look like Bond. They place Craig in the Bond clothes, next to the Bond women, in the Bond locations. And then Craig does his part, by playing Bond as a man, not as an idol. -- Advisory: This film contains violence.",1
" REINDEER GAMES: Action thriller. Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise. Directed by John Frankenheimer. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Directed by John Frankenheimer and written by San Francisco's Ehren Kruger, the film has some of the outrageousness of a Tarantino effort, but without the smirky nihilism and heartlessness. It's made by people who know the action genre inside out and yet don't feel the need to comment on the genre every two minutes. The tone is playful without being cute. The most impressive thing about Reindeer Games is how it is arranged as a succession of tense situations. Kruger, who is only 27, clearly has a killer instinct for the dramatic. Within minutes, he has the audience on edge. Ben Affleck is Rudy, a car thief with three days left to serve on his prison sentence. He has only one problem: One of his fellow inmates wants to kill him. A very big fellow inmate. That's just the first wild thing that presents itself in Reindeer Games. By the time the picture is over, Rudy's prison interlude seems like something from another movie. The troubles pile on the poor guy, while the audience never stops pulling for him. Affleck plays the familiar film noir hero -- a robust everyman, just smart enough to get himself into trouble and too dumb to get himself out. His path to trouble is a time- honored one. He arrives thanks to a woman, who seems so nice, so pretty -- at first. Charlize Theron plays Ashley, who strikes up a pen- pal relationship with Rudy's cell mate, Nick (James Frain). When Nick is killed on the day he is supposed to be released from prison, Rudy, also released that day, pretends to be Nick, and he and Ash ley go off to a motel. The evolution of the Ashley character, one of the delights of the film, can only be alluded to here. Frankenheimer and Theron present her, at first, as almost a parody of wholesomeness, with her white boots, bright smile and glistening eyes. Next thing we know, our hero has descended into film noir hell. Maybe it's not her fault. Then again, maybe she's willfully destructive. Whatever she is, she is trouble. Reindeer Games is a twisted caper film. Gary Sinise plays Ashley's brother, Gabriel, a violent criminal who kidnaps Rudy and forces him to take part in a casino robbery. They think Rudy is Nick, and Nick used to work at a casino. Rudy is trapped. All he wants is to get to his family's house in time for Christmas dinner and lead an upright life. Moments of comedy pop up throughout, without ever tilting the picture into satire or parody. As Gabriel, Sinise is dim-witted but too scary to be completely laughable. Affleck's transparency as an actor -- his ability to let us see the wheels turning as he tries to steer his way to survival -- makes for some funny moments. The script also provides Theron with the best lines, and she makes the most of them. Reindeer Games is an extremely violent film, and not all of its plot turns make sense under scrutiny. But Frankenheimer drives the action in such a way that there is no such thing as stopping to consider whether it all makes sense. This is exhilarating pop entertainment. .. ",1
" REMEMBER THE TITANS: Drama. Starring Denzel Washington and Will Patton. Directed by Boaz Yakin. (PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Based on a real-life drama that played out in Virginia, it uses football to tell a bigger story about the American South going through the growing pains of desegregation. The subject is handled with sensitivity, and the characters, even those on the wrong side of history, are treated with humanity and respect. The year is 1971, and two high schools in Arlington, Va. -- one white, one black -- have been combined. This means bringing together the two football teams. These guys don't just have to tolerate each other. They have to play together. Denzel Washington plays Coach Boone, who is brought in from out of town to become the head coach of the Titans. This is a blow to the school's current coach, Bill Yoast, a kindly, revered figure who by no means deserves to lose his job. Eventually Boone and Yoast decide to get along, just as the team must decide to get along, just as the school and community must decide to get along. Yoast takes a job as defensive coach under Boone, and the men grow into a working relationship. Remember the Titans makes a compelling case that the behavior of these men had a lasting effect on race relations in Arlington. Refreshingly, the movie doesn't go in the usual directions. Coach Boone is not the typical easygoing Denzel Washington character but a rigorous taskmaster who, according to Yoast, flirts with the line between tough and crazy. The white guy, in this case, is the softie, and yet both men stand to learn a lot from each other. As played by Washington, Boone is more than tough. He is a man of keen observation and restraint, and some of the film's best moments provide a glimpse into his inner world. In one scene, he points out that Yoast, without realizing it, tends to coddle the black players. Don't patronize them, Boone tells him. Most movies have trouble portraying teams, whether they're football players, companies of soldiers or merry bands of computer whizzes. Remember the Titans has its share of walking cliches. There's the obligatory enormous defensive tackle, for example, and another character whose only personality note is that he likes to sing. Yet for the most part, the film succeeds where other movies have failed, finding ways to personalize its characters. Ryan Hurst is particularly memorable as Bertier, a white All-America player who starts off the film loyal to Yoast and hostile toward Boone. Bertier's inner growth is rendered by Hurst largely without dialogue. It's all in his face. At first resentful of the black players, he becomes increasingly disgusted at the prejudice around him. Hurst gives us the beautiful spectacle of a very young man slowly but definitely coming into his humanity. These high school kids, supposedly 16 and 17 years old, are played by grown men, some of whom look to be pushing 30. One wonders how the film might have been with actual teenagers playing teenagers. Perhaps the loss in acting values would have been a bad trade for authenticity. One would hate to do without Wood Harris, for example, as Ju, a black player whose friendship with Bertier sets an example for the rest of the team. In its last 40 minutes, Remember the Titans gets a little schmaltzy, with a succession of scenes in which one character tells another all the wonderful things he's feeling inside. But the film earns its emotional moments, and it takes the audience along. The good news is that whenever the tear-and-a-smile stuff threatens to go overboard, the film pulls back and gives us another scene on the football field, and all the football scenes are strong. ..

" Redacted: Fictional documentary. Starring Izzy Diaz, Daniel Stewart Sherman, Patrick Carroll, Mike Figueroa and Ty Jones. Directed by Brian De Palma. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The standard line on anti-war movies is that Hollywood starts making them six or seven years after a war, never during one. Redacted, the latest from director Brian De Palma, not only goes against that pattern but also is a new type of anti-war film, one that could have been made only during wartime. It isn't elegiac, but enraged. It doesn't look back with sorrow, but forward in dread. And it's made with a clear intention - to stop the Iraq war.  Its historical significance can be summed up in a sentence: Redacted is the angriest, most vehemently pacifist film ever made by a major American filmmaker in a time of war. It's a movie devoid of any reflexive sentimentality about the troops or the mission, and it doesn't even bother pretending. If a foreign filmmaker made it, it would seem an unpleasant provocation. But coming from the man who made Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables and Carlito's Way, it has to go down as one of the bravest and most unambiguous cinematic statements of the decade. De Palma was able to make the movie because he could make it on the cheap, on digital video. And then he turned around and made a virtue of necessity, using various kinds of video and video techniques to tell his story with a maximum of immediacy and innovation. Sometimes we watch the soldiers filming themselves. Sometimes we see surveillance footage or video put out on the Web. Hidden cameras record conversations in some scenes. In others we see footage from a French documentary about Iraq.  All of it is fictional and created by De Palma, who won a completely deserved Silver Lion for best director at the Venice Film Festival this year. The characters are fictional as well. But the events depicted are based on truth, including the film's central incident, in which American soldiers rape a 14-year-old Iraqi girl, murder her family, shoot her in the face and then set her body on fire.  Video, with its present-tense feel, creates the sense of being there. Sweat trickles down soldiers' faces as they stand at a checkpoint, and the audience waits for disaster - a sniper, a car bomb. The movie conveys the hellish boredom and terror of the front lines and shows the toll they take, and yet it never absolves the characters of moral responsibility. Some would never lose their humanity under pressure, some do, and some use the war as a pretext to be as cruel and demented as they've always wanted to be. The troops are not a monolith, but people of varying strengths and weaknesses. The flavor of barracks life is presented through footage shot by a character named Salazar (Izzy Diaz), who hopes to get into film school on the strength of an Iraq documentary. The soldier banter is the film's most erratic element. Sometimes it rings true, as when a soldier reacts to the killing of a pregnant woman at a checkpoint by saying, You can't afford remorse. You get remorse, you get weak; you get weak, you die. It sounds like exactly the kind of mantra that a stupid young man might offer as wisdom. Yet the movie veers into obviousness with the character of Flake (Patrick Carroll), a dead-eyed psychopath who seems to revel calmly in having killed the pregnant woman. He's a character set up for us to hate. Still, even at its most blatantly manipulative, Redacted provokes a response of rage, disgust and anger. De Palma strives to ignite passion, and while some of that passion may end up directed at the film itself, Redacted is an antidote to apathy. It's not the easiest movie to sit through, but who said movies are supposed to be easy to sit through? De Palma must have been absent the day they taught that in film school. Rather than create a perfect, contained whole, De Palma has created a film that finds its meaning in the outside world, in the effect he hopes it will have. His movie is naked and obvious and sizable enough to hate or love, kind of like Charlie Chaplin's speech at the end of The Great Dictator. Sometimes the world intrudes. Sometimes issues are so big that there's really no point in being elegant. -- Advisory: This film contains graphic violence, strong language, simulated sex - and real photos of dead Iraqis.",1
" Romantic comedy-drama. Starring Vera Farmiga and Andy Garcia. Directed by Adam Rodgers. (R. 99 minutes.) There's a whole genre of youth movie, the one great night genre, in which two young people meet, share romance and adventure and look up to realize that their lives have changed entirely over the course of a few hours. At Middleton is the middle-aged equivalent of those pictures, a one great day movie, about two adults, very different from each other in personality, who make an unexpected and deep connection that they can't deny. It's a lovely film that grows along with the characters. At first, it seems like a pleasing but inconsequential comedy. But it deepens as their connection deepens and opens up into a place of poignancy and insight. And Vera Farmiga and Andy Garcia - not the first pair of actors you might imagine together - are beautifully matched. Both play parents accompanying their teenage children on a college tour. Edith (Farmiga) is impulsive, funny and down to earth, a big personality whose occasional lapses into faux-jocular hostility are the only hints of some underlying unhappiness. And George (Garcia, cast against type) is all about self-control, a heart surgeon who wears a bowtie and presents an implacable facade. But because he's played by Garcia, you know that the facade is protecting a volatile emotional nature. Inevitably, they meet, and just as inevitably, they initially dislike each other. But when they escape the pre-packaged tour and wander off on their own, they have to amend their initial impressions. At Middleton is structured as a series of little episodes, all of a kind that might happen on a college campus, each one serving to bring Edith and George just a little bit closer. A great strength of At Middleton, though some might see this as a weakness, resides in the resistance of director and co-writer Adam Rodgers to spell out the details of Edith and George's home lives. For a long time we don't know, for example, whether either is married or divorced. Nor do we know the precise circumstances that have left them with such emptiness waiting to be filled. The details don't matter - indeed, they're best imagined.  In one very memorable scene - perhaps the best in the movie - the two are invited to participate in an acting class, in which they must improvise a fraught marital conversation. Quite quickly - acting-class improvisations are almost always like this - the conversation becomes raw and painful, and the normally contained George has to struggle not to break down. It's a wonderful scene for both actors, but especially for Garcia, who has been ill-served in some of his recent films.  Among the wrong assumptions of youth is that the most passionate feelings are experienced when young. But middle-aged people have an awareness of the clock, and that's a profound intensifier. Rodgers and cinematographer Emmanuel Kadosh express this vividly and wordlessly in a scene in which Edith and George join some students and run into a fountain. The film goes to slow motion, and the droplets are like sprays of diamonds around them. The grown-ups know with an urgency that their kids can't quite grasp, that at the end of your life you'll always wish you'd jumped in the water.  Peter Riegert makes a welcome appearance as a campus DJ, and Edith and George's children, played by Taissa Farmiga (Vera's sister) and Spencer Lofranco, respectively, are given specifically drawn characters to play, not generic teenagers. So they give more than generic performances. ",1
" Romantic comedy. Starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Ken Kwapis. (PG-13. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) So the idea of He's Just Not That Into You is that if a guy wants to call you, he will. If he likes you, he will make the effort. And if he doesn't, that means he's not interested. There's an opposite-sex corollary to this, expressed to me by a friend when I was 16 and trying to figure out what was going on with a girl who supposedly liked me. He said, If you don't know what's going on, nothing's going on. And nothing was. These aren't profound, breakthrough observations, but they provide enough of a hook on which to hang this long but surprisingly likable comedy, which follows the romantic tribulations of a handful of adults, most of them in their 30s. He's Just Not That Into You never soars, but it never flags. It remains brisk, engaging and pleasant throughout, and face it: If a movie this well made had Spanish or French subtitles, we'd all be talking about it as a searing examination of sexual politics.  The cast is top heavy with famous actresses: Jennifer Connelly, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore and Scarlett Johansson. Each gets her moment to show why she bothered making the movie (except Barrymore, who gets off a couple of good lines and that's about all). Connelly has a nice showcase as a control freak, channeling her unconscious anxieties into a home remodel. Aniston, properly forlorn, is a woman coming to realize that her live-in boyfriend (Ben Affleck) is probably never going to marry her. And Johansson is a dangerous young thing, so intent on seducing a married man that she incites pity for the married man (Bradley Cooper). Johansson's Woody Allen exposure has paid off: In just a few years, she has become a deft comic actress. But the revelation of He's Just Not That Into You is Ginnifer Goodwin, who has mainly worked in television but also had a notable role as Johnny Cash's first wife in Walk the Line. Bitter and angry in that film, she is completely open, radiant and comically inspired in this one, playing a repeat loser in the game of love. Gigi (Goodwin) has no defenses, gives too much, talks too much and spends a lot of time sitting by the phone. If this doesn't launch Goodwin on a substantial film career, there's no hope. The movie has a couple of mildly irritating flourishes. It's arranged into chapters (to evoke the self-help book of the same name) and at the start of each, there are mock woman-on-the-street interviews about various romantic topics. Sex and the City dropped that self-conscious gimmick after the first season, and it should have stayed dropped. The movie also does its best to promote our decade's favorite romantic-comedy myth, which is that gay people spend all their free time worrying about the straight friends' sex lives.  Still, somebody in Hollywood has tried to make a thoughtful movie about love, and that rarely happens anymore. Let's take it and like it.-- Advisory:Sexual situations.",1
" Romantic comedy. Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Zoe Kazan and Adam Driver. Directed by Michael Dowse. (PG-13. 102 minutes.) Half the movies in existence don't depend on audiences wondering what will happen but how it will happen. This is the case with most crime films, almost all action films and at least 99 percent of romantic comedies. Of these, the rom-coms are the most fascinating, because they rely not on danger, effects or thrills, but on the inherent appeal of two actors, the charm of them in combination and the odd goodwill of spectators who really care - who await the triumph of love as though they have a personal stake.  What If doesn't break any new ground in love stories, but something about it feels fresh all the same. It takes place in Toronto, not the faux New York Toronto we often see in movies, but a romantic city with a Chicago-like skyline and lots of open space. It brings together (more or less) Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan, who have two big advantages: (1) They're appropriately young (too many romantic comedies have 40-year-olds acting like they're 25); and (2) They're just idiosyncratic and imperfect enough in their look and manner that we can believe in them as individuals and make the emotional investment. The movie, which won the Canadian screen award for best adapted screenplay, was released in Canada last year under the title The F Word, the F in this case referring to that most dreaded word of all ... friend. Radcliffe is Wallace, who meets Chantry (Kazan), and their immediate bantering rapport bespeaks the kind of connection that might never get old. But Chantry has a perfectly nice boyfriend (Rafe Spall) with a glamorous career, and so Wallace is put in the friend zone - at first willingly, then less so. From here, you can probably write the rest of the story yourself, but the extra quality of magic - that's the hard part. Somehow What If creates drama, interest and longing just by placing the characters near each other. And something in the way director Michael Dowse presents them makes us see the two through each other's eyes, as the embodiment of everything worth having. Radcliffe, who has been flirting with adulthood in his recent screen outings, arrives as a wry, unconventionally handsome leading man. And Kazan is radiant. They are the serious (potential) couple - diminutive, cautious, sincere - and they are supported here by a tall, wild, funny couple, played by Adam Driver and Mackenzie Davis. The forthright couple flanked by zanies - this has been a classic pattern dating all the way back to 1930s musicals, Much Ado About Nothing, and beyond. That's fine. Patterns only become cliches when they're misused. Other familiar patterns on display include convenient business trips and the intrusion of major life choices, but these don't feel like conveniences of the script but emblems of a time in life when big decisions must be made. What If misuses only one romantic comedy cliche, the most pernicious of all: It tries to pump up the tension by inserting a completely meaningless and unbelievable argument. It's a particular misstep here, because it necessitates making reasonable characters unreasonable and communicative characters uncommunicative. For a short but irritating stretch, the whole movie gets wrenched into a place of falsehood. Fortunately, What If rights itself well before the finish and finds its way back to the truth and the light. ",1
" Romantic comedy. Starring Emily Blunt and Jason Segel. Directed by Nicholas Stoller. (R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Of the many good things about The Five-Year Engagement, the most curious is the illusion it creates that nothing special is happening, that things are just flowing along, and that it's just like life. Onscreen, people are apparently going through something, and we're watching them, but it's all very easy and unforced.  Meanwhile every scene in The Five-Year Engagement - virtually every part of every scene - is carefully crafted to introduce an original comic situation, work it and build on it. The movie is a precision instrument with no parts jammed together, just everything smooth and functioning. Take a moment to notice the actual work going on here, and you'll be impressed at the skill. Even then, you'll be dragged back into the picture's spell in less than a minute.  The Five-Year Engagement is a romantic comedy, but not about the usual thing, about people meeting and learning to commit. The movie's first scene begins with a marriage proposal: Tom (Jason Segel) is a sous chef in a San Francisco restaurant, and Violet (Emily Blunt) is a doctoral student in behavioral psychology. Though not exactly launched on their careers, both have good prospects, and they decide to get married. Couples face enough challenges. They don't have to invent trouble. Co-writer-director Nicholas Stoller and co-writer Segel understand this, so they throw out all the usual romantic-comedy tropes: There are no concocted disagreements. No elaborate situation where one tricks the other and then is found out. No arguments based on a misunderstanding. Yes, they do occasionally argue, but for the reasons people argue in real life - because they do understand each other. Blunt and Segel look like people who belong together, which is essential to The Five-Year Engagement. They seem crazy about each other, but not crazy. As befits a couple contemplating marriage, there's no stress between them. The interaction is relaxed and natural. Here and elsewhere, Segel is really good at playing a warm, modest, considerate guy, and Blunt has evolved since emerging six years ago in The Devil Wears Prada. Once brittle, she is now open and spontaneous. Some of her best moments have an improvised feeling about them, that of an actress connecting with her co-star and working in complete freedom. In The Five-Year Engagement, the pressures come from without - in a sense it's another romantic comedy, like Going the Distance, about two gifted young adults in a scarcity economy. Violet gets an appointment at the University of Michigan, and so they decide to relocate there. (San Francisco never looked so good as when intercut with scenes of Ann Arbor buried in snow.) That might have been fine for them, except that Tom, who could have had his own restaurant in San Francisco, can't get decent work. The screenplay doesn't pump up the stakes; it makes nothing extreme. These are just two people, and this is the drama of the everyday. The filmmakers trust that you'll be interested in what happens to the couple, and in return they keep it honest. The major events of The Five-Year Engagement are small in scale: Tom grows mutton chops like Chester A. Arthur, becomes wan and loses confidence, but he doesn't transform into someone unrecognizable. He's the same guy, but fairly miserable, and Violet is the same, too, but busy. In a movie constructed of subtle bits, there are bound to be times when the bits are unsubtle or unsuccessful - that happens here, but not often. For the most part, The Five-Year Engagement has charm and emotion. There's a lot of wit in the editing, and at the same time Stoller and Segel know when not to cut, when to let scenes play out. Sometimes Tom and Violet just want to talk, and they let them do it.",1
" Romantic comedy. Starring Josh Radnor, Kate Mara, Malin Akerman and Zoe Kazan. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There's a point in life where being young starts to get old, but being adult seems like too much of a risk, and Happythank-youmoreplease presents people at that juncture - right before they take the leap. It's an observant and heartfelt film, with turns of dialogue that show that writer-director Josh Radnor really can write.  It's not that he writes clever lines. Any reasonably intelligent person can do that. His talent is evident in the economy with which he is able to show relationships in motion: A line or two back and forth, and people shift and change and come into new understandings of each other, just as they do in life and as they often don't do in movies. Happythankyoumore-please does something else that most movies don't do: It gets better as it goes along. The first 20 minutes are lumbering and a trifle obvious, and then a story gradually settles in about three couples, one established and two emerging, during a pivotal period of about 10 days. The characters are around 30 and living in New York, trying to make it in the arts and struggling, and talking incessantly about their emotional lives. No kidding, it's hard to say something new about this kind of thing, but Radnor does - or, in any case, he makes what he has to say feel fresh.  Radnor himself is attractive onscreen, part slacker, part ladies' man, though he has too much of a fondness for filming himself looking dumbfounded. (Those shots are a dead giveaway that this is an actor directing himself; otherwise, it would be hard to tell.) Malin Akerman plays his best friend, a woman with alopecia. It's not the point of the movie. She just happens to be bald. It's a nice detail.  Happythankyoumore-please is not just about love. It deals with a real phenomenon not often addressed. When we're very young and imagine our future, we're usually, in effect, imagining about five lives. Then somewhere around 27, 28, 29, the reality kicks in that you've only got one, and you've got to decide what it's going to be, because if you don't, life is going to decide for you. The movie is really about the courage required to navigate 30. Those who've successfully navigated it tend to minimize it, but it's no joke. This is an honest film about something real. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, strong language.",1
" Romantic comedy. Starring Meagan Good, Gabrielle Union, Taraji P. Henson and Regina Hall. Directed by Tim Story. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Think Like a Man is a romantic comedy about four women who decide to manipulate their men by using the relationship advice found in a self-help book. The book - a real-life best-seller, Steve Harvey's Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man - gives women practical instruction on how to tell if he's serious, when to have sex and how to make him pop the question. Take those situations and fictionalize them a little, and you can see how this could be the basis for a good-enough, by-the-books comedy.But Think Like a Man is better than that. Though it is funny - at times, laugh-out-loud funny - this comedy is by and for adults. Three of the four women are played by actresses either around or just past 40, and consequently the stakes behind their relationships are higher than what you usually get in romantic comedies. Kristen (Gabrielle Union) lives with a guy who shows no interest in getting married. Candace (Regina Hall) is a single mother. Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) is so successful she can't find a man who isn't scared off by her money and position. And Mya (Meagan Good) can't seem to get a second date - though if you've ever seen Meagan Good that is very, very hard to believe.The movie provides the rare and satisfying spectacle of four gorgeous, intelligent women actually playing four gorgeous, intelligent women - not the victims of a psycho, or the girlfriends of a detective, or prostitutes bemoaning the hard life of a pimp. That these are four gorgeous, intelligent black actresses, who rarely find roles in feature films worthy of their talent, wit or power, makes Think Like a Man even more something to appreciate. Oh, yeah, there are men in this movie, too, and they're not bad, either. They fill out the male types of Mama's boy (Terrence Jenkins), dreamer (Michael Ealy), Player (Romany Malco) and perpetual adolescent (Jerry Ferrara). Thrown into the mix - and a major source of the movie's propulsion - is comedian Kevin Hart, as a newly divorced man who insists that he's having the time of his life. Hart gives a lift to what might otherwise be static conversation scenes, playing every moment with an edge of franticness and hysteria. Most of the big laughs in Think Like a Man come from him. Men and women play games and deceive each other on the way to falling in love - that's a familiar movie pattern, and some of the misunderstandings here are predictable. In one case, people don't explain when they would and should in real life and in any honest screenplay. But for the most part the movie avoids cliches, or at least subverts them. The men and women take turns being wrong, and love doesn't always play out according to formula. There are lessons for everybody, which is what love stories are ultimately about - love as the great educator. Think Like a Man runs 122 minutes, long for a romantic comedy. It doesn't feel long, not at all. The script, by Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, is packed with tricky situations and funny incidents, and, if anything, it's a triumph of economy. It covers four relationships with enough detail to do justice to all of them, without ever giving the sense of a movie going sideways to account for everybody. At every moment, the motion is forward, with the audience wondering what will happen next.Director Tim Story finds a tone that supports the big laughs and the tender moments. He does his job, keeping the audience laughing - and caring - from start to finish.",1
" Romantic comedy. Starring Virginie Ledoyen, Emmanuel Mouret, Julie Gayet and Michael Cohen. Directed by Emmanuel Mouret. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For a year and a half, Shall We Kiss? has been on my short list of French films that deserve to be seen but, alas, might never find their way to an American release. Well, here it is, an engaging romantic comedy that's deeper, smarter and more pessimistic than it appears at first glance, a film with shrewd insight into the mysteries of human attraction. Two strangers meet in Nantes. He (Michael Cohen) lives there. She (Julie Gayet) is passing through. At the end of their first evening together, with the air sparking with sexual tension, he goes to kiss her, and she pulls away. It's not that she doesn't want to. It's just that she knows two other people who thought they could kiss casually, and it didn't work out that way ... From that framing device, the narrative switches to the main story, that of Judith (Virginie Ledoyen), a happily married woman, whose best friend since high school is Nicolas (Emmanuel Mouret). One day the perfect platonic purity of their relationship is altered when Nicolas asks her to kiss him. She says yes, and from there ... well, anyway, that's all you need to hear from me.  Though the French are great at making romantic dramas, their romantic comedies, contrary to what many Americans might think, tend to be a little off - unpleasant, harsh and tonally peculiar. But Shall We Kiss?, written and directed by Mouret (who also plays Nicolas), shows a masterful control of mood and genre. At first, the story of Judith and Nicolas borders on light farce, but it moves seamlessly toward something more consequential. The movie is about the ramifications of actions that might, in the moment, seem natural and pure - and about the atmospheres that allow love to thrive. It's about love's paradoxes and about the value and the limits of commitment. In true French style, it offers no answers but it poses the right questions. Ledoyen is one of the joys of modern French cinema, an arresting young actress with a delicate look, an alert unsentimental intelligence and a deep, husky voice that sounds as if she started smoking prenatally. Mouret directs himself in a self-effacing but effective way that capitalizes on his comic strengths. And Gayet and Cohen give off a strong erotic charge in their present-day scenes - all decorum on the surface, but with a churning undercurrent. -- Advisory: Sexual situations and nudity.",1
" Romantic drama. Starring Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur. Directed by Ritesh Batra. In English and in Hindi with English subtitles. (PG. 104 minutes.)The most lasting result of seeing The Lunchbox is an intense desire for Indian food. In fact, here's an idea for a great evening out - a screening of this movie, followed by a long, sumptuous dinner at a good Indian restaurant. Beyond that, The Lunchbox is a mixed affair, mostly a pleasure, but with a nonending ending that will leave many frustrated. It's a story grounded in India's elaborate lunch system, in which bicycle carriers deliver home-cooked meals to men at their workplace. Nimrat Kaur plays a young, unloved wife who tries to rekindle her husband's passion through her cooking, but her lunches keep getting delivered to another man - Saajan (Irrfan Khan), a stern fellow nearing retirement. Over the course of several weeks, these two lonely people open up to each other through a series of notes, delivered back and forth in the lunch box. There's a sensuous undertone throughout The Lunchbox. The food glistens. Have you ever seen string beans glowing? (At one point, when a co-worker starts eating half of his food, I wanted Saajan to stab him with a fork.) And Kaur, though the movie tries to tone down her beauty with plain-Jane clothes and makeup, is as ripe and gorgeous as the food.  But it's hard to know what to make of Khan as Saajan. Khan has the looks and dignity of a major star, but he is only in his 40s, while Saajan is supposed to be retiring after 35 years. So is Saajan supposed to be in his 50s? Then at one point, he says that his room smells like an old man's room, so is he supposed to be older than that? It would help to be able to tell, because the whole film consists of building an audience's desire for the two central characters to meet, and we can see, plainly, that the wife is young, probably in her early 30s. We're rooting for something - it would help to know what exactly we're rooting for. Like a lot of movies, but especially foreign films, The Lunchbox has a central idea and winning characters, and it builds a compelling situation. But it never really transcends its gimmick: Wouldn't it be interesting if two people met through a lunch box? Well, yes, it would. But what happens then? Please go back and work on the screenplay for another few weeks, and let us know.  Fortunately, The Lunchbox survives better than most films suffering from this common failing, because of its lush atmosphere, but also because it keeps the audience hoping that the story will pay off. For this reason, The Lunchbox is better as an experience than as a memory. When you're watching it, you can still believe it might actually be heading somewhere.",1
" Romantic drama. Starring Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins. Directed by Barry Jenkins. (Not rated. 85 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) In Medicine for Melancholy, writer-director Barry Jenkins demonstrates a rare ability to communicate a state of mind through images. We don't just know what the characters are feeling. We know what the filmmaker is feeling and what he's trying to communicate with every shot. Under the subdued, dignified surface, this movie - about the 24 hours after a one-night stand - churns with a filmmaker's fascination and wonder, sadness and longing. Beautiful use is made of the film's San Francisco location. If only life were as interesting as Jenkins makes it look - but then, maybe it is, and we don't see it. Certainly, his protagonists don't: A man and a woman wake up in bed one morning after a party, having had a drunken romp. They're hung over and embarrassed. But the world around them looks crisp and full of promise. Throughout, Jenkins offers two points of view at once: life as experienced by the characters and the world as revealed by the camera.  This double viewpoint, the simultaneous presence of realism and romanticism, is the product of directorial skill and passion, and it's the standout virtue of Medicine for Melancholy. Micah (Wyatt Cenac of The Daily Show) and Jo (Tracey Heggins), two African Americans around 30 years old, ride in a taxi on the way back to their respective homes. They'll probably never see each other again. It's a sour morning. Yet something in the cinematography - in the city outside the taxi window, and in the composition of the two, in medium shot, sharing the same frame - suggests that something richer is available to them. The film is shot in a washed-out color palette that most of the time looks black and white, though usually something (a shirt, a jacket, the sky) pops out with a slight hint of color. Perhaps the drained colors are meant to convey a mood of sadness, but the result is too attractive to indicate a dulled state of mind. More likely, Jenkins intended to distance the audience from looking at the world of the film in strictly realistic terms.  Medicine for Melancholy addresses the challenges of being black in San Francisco, which has the lowest African American population of any major U.S. city. The two lovers come at the question from different angles. Micah lives in the Tenderloin and is politically engaged, but slightly paranoid (he thinks black history month is in February because it's the shortest month in the year). Jo, who is living with a white man in the Marina, thinks Micah is too focused on race, and yet she also seems to feel some awareness of being in the minority. Cenac shows Micah's surface diffidence shift into sly self-assurance, as Heggins shows the sensitive nature that Jo is protecting.  Some of the movie's social and political concerns have been overtaken by recent events. Barack Obama, for example, is never mentioned, though it's hard to imagine that name not coming up in any current debate about racial progress, real or illusory. Even more noticeable is that Micah's major political preoccupation, gentrification, seems almost nostalgic now, in light of the financial collapse.  But Medicine for Melancholy isn't special because of its ideas. Less important than what the characters say to each other is how they say it, the nuances of their interaction, the push and pull of their impulses toward connection or self-protection. Their feelings of loneliness and dislocation, of standing on the outside of the city looking in, are common to people who are young and haven't yet found their place. Medicine for Melancholy is about the anguish and romance of that time of life.By the way, Barry Jenkins will answer questions from the audience on Friday and Saturday after the 7:20 p.m. shows and on Sunday after the 4:40 and 7:20 p.m. shows.-- Advisory: Sexual situations and strong language.",1
" Romantic fantasy. Starring Alden Ehrenreich, Alice Englert, Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson and Viola Davis. Directed by Richard LaGravenese. (PG-13. 124 minutes.)We have come a long way since Bette Davis said the immortal line I'd really like to kiss you, but I just washed my hair. Today, that idea has morphed into I'd really like to have sex with you, but I'm afraid I might kill you. Or as the teenage witch in Beautiful Creatures says to her mortal boyfriend, I'm scared I'm going to hurt you. I mean kill you hurt you.  This is silly stuff, but powerful all the same. With the sexes reversed, this sentiment propelled the entire Twilight saga, which transmuted a teenage virgin's anxiety into her vampire boyfriend's terror that he might devour her. In a similar way, a teenage boy in Beautiful Creatures feels that finding a girl who likes him is a bigger miracle than her being a supernatural being. He wants to prove himself, like all young men, and if that means risking death just to have a girlfriend, hey, what's the big deal? Sex can kill you - but it's worth it. To watch Beautiful Creatures is to be impressed at how it taps into the passions, anxieties and distorted perceptions of youth, almost as if someone devised a series of buttons to press - and out came money. The boy's mother is dead, which makes his need for the feminine even more intense. He is stuck in high school and can't wait for his life to start. He is surrounded by provincials and longs for something special. He lives in a drab small town in South Carolina and dreams of New York City.  Yet in the actual experience of it, Beautiful Creatures doesn't feel like a cynical product, but rather like something arrived at organically. That might not be true, but that's how it seems. Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese, from the novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, it's about a teenage boy, Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich), who falls in love with Lena (Alice Englert), the new girl in town, and tries to help her through a difficult transition. The transition in this case is that in 75 days, on her 16th birthday, she will undergo the Claiming, a rite of passage all female witches - or casters - must go through. In a Claiming, a girl's soul is chosen by either the dark side or the light side. She will become either good or evil. The way she goes will have something to do with who she is intrinsically, but as in all things in life, there are complications and political considerations, so that, nice as Lena may be, her fate is hardly assured.  Surrounding these two young actors are several heavyweight actors, including Jeremy Irons as Lena's uncle Macon, who even dresses like he's evil: long coats, lots of layers, crisp tailoring, perfect hair. But as casters go, he's actually a decent guy. The one to look out for is Emma Thompson, who gets to tap into her roots as a comedian as Lena's evil mother, who is pure spirit but chooses to inhabit, just for laughs, the town's most conservative church lady. Thus, Thompson has the pleasure of playing two Southern types, the prim, repressed and judgmental, and the flamboyant, mischievous and confident. Also on the side of evil - these evil roles are fun - is Emmy Rossum as Lena's sexy, outrageous cousin. Beautiful Creatures has its metaphysical cosmology worked out, and it gives it to us in doses big enough that we understand its rules and believe in its world, but not so big that it starts to get cute or that we stop caring. Usually, when there is any explaining to be done, Viola Davis, as a mystical librarian, does it, and, as always, Davis looks like she's seen things. She's telling you some of it, but she has seen even more. Still, the main focus remains on those nice kids, and though all viewers over the age of 18 will find themselves thinking, Break up, and meet someone else, the movie will remind you of a time when sensible thinking was just not an option, and of how exhilarating that felt. The human values are very much at center stage. In fact, Beautiful Creatures could easily become the thinking-person's Twilight, assuming all that thinking doesn't scare away audiences. ",1
" Romantic musical drama. Starring Hrithic Roshan and Barbara Mori. Directed by Anurag Basu. In English and in Spanish and Hindi with English subtitles. (Not rated. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The Bollywood film Kites is being released in two versions. Here in the Bay Area, we're so cool that we're getting the original 130-minute version. In other parts of the country, they're getting a 90-minute re-edit called Kites: The Remix. I saw the long version, and it doesn't feel in any way stretched or dull. It tells a simple story - an almost archetypal story - but it does so with a lot of passion and technical sophistication.In its editing (fast) and its psychological penetration (shallow), Kites has the feeling of a rock video, with time set aside for spoken interludes. People talk for a bit, and then there's singing on the soundtrack, and we see the characters going about their business. For minutes at a stretch, we don't hear what's spoken, just the singing, and yet the story doesn't stop moving during the songs. It keeps advancing, so there's none of that start-and-stop quality that you sometimes get with screen musicals. In fact, the songs and the special atmosphere allow the filmmakers to condense all the story matter that's boring and to elongate everything that's interesting. The plot is like something out of an old Robert Mitchum movie: Our hero (Hrithic Roshan), a shady Indian hoping to make his fortune in the United States, is about to step into wealth: He's almost certain to marry the daughter of the richest gangster and casino owner in Las Vegas. And then ... he takes one look at Natasha, the beautiful Mexican fiancee of his future brother-in-law, and he's gone. Actually, in terms of setup, the story is not unlike Woody Allen's Match Point: Two people from the wrong side of the tracks are about to marry into wealth, when they suddenly and rather stupidly become attracted to each other. But in feeling and aura, two movies couldn't be further from each other. Woody Allen is a thinker who believes in luck. Kites is empty-headed and believes in love. It believes in love as only a film can that's made within a chaste culture. Notice this - it will enhance your appreciation of the movie: Roshan and Barbara Mori, the two leads, are as beautiful as human beings can be, and the love they depict is as high-flown as you'll find in a movie. But their relationship is never consummated. No sex, nothing even close to it. At one point, she's wearing something like a bathing-suit top, and she makes him turn around while she wraps a towel around herself.Mori is playing a 30-year-old gold-digger in Las Vegas, and the movie expects us to believe that she's a virgin and to believe that he would believe it, too. Go ahead and laugh, but that unreleased sexual energy is what fuels everything worth seeing in the movie. It's what's behind the near-hysterical romanticism of the musical passages and the wordless interludes. Because there's no sex in Kites, the songs are the sex, and there's not a drop of cynicism in any one of them. It's all pure, all loving, all a matter of life and death, just the way you felt when you were a teenager. This is opera. This is the big stuff, folks. This is a choir, a drum machine, a synthesizer, a 17-piece orchestra and an echo chamber all screaming Love! Love! Love! Go in smirking, but by the time it's over, you'll believe.-- Advisory: Violence.",1
" Romantic youth fantasy. Starring Vanessa Hudgens, Alex Pettyfer and Mary-Kate Olsen. Directed by Daniel Barnz. (PG-13. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)A sweet film - a modern riff on Beauty and the Beast - Beastly is a youth romance, directed by Daniel Barnz, who showed imagination and sensitivity in his feature Phoebe in Wonderland and hasn't lost those qualities now that he's entered the world of the big budgets.  An exploration of beauty, inner and outer, it gives us the modern-day fable of a handsome and horribly arrogant high school kid whose face, overnight, becomes as ugly as he is inside. We meet him in his handsome incarnation, campaigning for student government with a speech that asks, Are you going to vote for me because I'm a rich, good-looking guy with a famous news anchor dad? And the answer is 'Hell, yeah.'  Oh, yes, the script is a little ham-fisted, plowing through exposition and establishing character with a steam shovel, but in a tale like this, sometimes being obvious and cutting to the chase can be a virtue. Yes, Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) is a real jerk - mean and cynical, a social bully with the makings of a truly monstrous man. And then one day he makes the mistake of insulting the school witch, who is played by Mary-Kate Olsen (that in itself should have given him pause). As the witch, Olsen slouches, pouts, rolls her eyes and is the essence of self-absorbed, self-satisfied self-confidence. She turns Kyle beastly, in a spell that can only be reversed by a woman's telling him I love you within the year. In other words, he has to become lovable by developing inner qualities, because it's clear he's going no place with that face. Actually, Kyle could have been a lot uglier (like Aaron Eckhart in The Dark Knight ugly), but the movie spared us. As it stands, about the worst that can be said for him is that he has weird tattoos and scars all over his head and what appear to be fresh lacerations on his face. He's also bald, though that's not a problem, since women dig that.  Vanessa Hudgens plays the heroine of the tale, Lindy, Kyle's last best hope of an I love you some time this century. Hudgens has a pure and idiosyncratic look that makes us believe in Lindy's unique spirit. Hudgens looks like an average pretty young woman, and then the camera closes in on her face, and you almost forget the movie because she's so ... not beautiful so much as ... alive. Vivid. That's a face made for movies. Alas, even at 86 minutes, Beastly starts to feel stretched inside an hour. To head off a quick resolution, Barnz, who also wrote the screenplay, relies on the two most familiar and least forgivable devices familiar from bad romantic comedies: (1) The movie gets to the point that it can end, if only someone tells someone something, but the person chooses not to, for no discernible reason; and (2) There's a concocted misunderstanding that could also be resolved with a brief conversation, but that conversation is delayed. That the presence of these devices seems less intrusive here than elsewhere probably has to do with the movie's supernatural trappings, the charm of the actors, and the urgency of the situation. Still, the script really does cave in toward the finish. Still I liked this movie, maybe more than I should have, and would be happy to see anything this director wants to do next.",1
" Ryan and Kevin Kline. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Recently I saw a film where it looked as if the young couple were munching on each other -- like a pair of Roto-Rooters. Not pretty. That may be real-life kissing, but it's not movie kissing. Movie kissing comes in the middle of French Kiss, when Ryan, asleep on a train, dreams of her fiance. She rolls over and, still asleep, starts kissing her traveling companion, played by Kevin Kline. Until this point Ryan has seemed prim and buttoned-down, and with her hair in a short, unbecoming tangle, she doesn't even look very pretty. But when she kisses Kline, kisses him as if he's some incredibly wonderful flavor of ice cream she's never tasted, she changes before your eyes. The obligatory screen kiss becomes a defining character moment. You think: Whoa, Kevin. Don't let this one go. Never-ever-ever. It's touches like this that make a romantic comedy -- not suspense, obviously, since you always know who will end up with whom. You go to a romantic comedy to see appealing people at their most  vulnerable and revealed, but in an atmosphere of optimism, where everything has to work out right. Apparently director Lawrence Kasdan understands that. He takes what could have been a fluffy comedy with lots of plot complications and picturesque scenery and instead puts his focus on the important things: on the characters played by Ryan and Kline and how they happen to be feeling. With his attention in the right place, Kasdan comes up with ways of using the setting to make emotional points. For example, though the film doesn't go out of its way to make you notice, Ryan keeps missing out on getting to see the Eiffel Tower. It's behind her as she's riding in a car, or she's turning toward it a second after they've turned out the lights. She doesn't know what she's missing -- until eventually she does. Ryan plays Kate, a nervous Nellie who overcomes her terror of flying when her physician fiance (Timothy Hutton) goes to France and dumps her for a beautiful French woman. On the plane Kate meets Luc, a scruffy, overbearing Frenchman, who also happens to be a petty criminal. Kline might seem odd casting for a Frenchman -- and he certainly comes off that way in ads for the film on TV. In fact, he's extraordinary. He doesn't have just the accent perfected but the speech rhythms and the manner as well. He is as believably French as French actor Francois Cluzet, who appears here in a minor role of a con man. Luc uses Kate to unwittingly smuggle goods into France. And as the picture develops, circumstances keep throwing them together -- and preventing Kate from hooking up with her ex-fiance. The rest you know, of course, but with this film getting there is a pleasure. Ryan's comic timing continues to delight, while Kline is touchingly heartfelt as a man doing what is evidently all too easy to do -- fall in love with Meg Ryan. ",1
" SCHIZOPOLIS: Comedy. Starring Steven Soderbergh. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (Not rated. 96 minutes. At the Roxie.) Written and directed by Steven Soderbergh, who came to prominence in 1989 with sex, lies and videotape, Schizopolis is the kind of personal, independent film one might expect from a first-time director. But that's what's good about it. It's fresh, unexpected and goofy. It's not a smart career move, just a film that its director wanted to make for some crazy reason, and he made it. Playful is not the usual word one might associate with Soderbergh, who runs to the somber and dark. But if Soderbergh had to repress a silly streak while making Kafka and The Underneath, here he's repressing nothing. Before the opening credits, Soderbergh himself appears behind a lectern and announces that Schizopolis is the most important film of our time, and that if people don't understand it, it's their fault. A minute later, Soderbergh is back onscreen as the lead character, a speechwriter for the head of a Scientology-like movement. The humor is dry and absurdist. At one point, the hero looks at himself in a men's room mirror and makes a series of funny faces. These are good funny faces, a bunch of them, and all of them different. But who ever knew that Soderbergh had this in him? He plays Fletcher, a man whose wife is having an affair with a dentist. The dentist is also played by Soderbergh. In another section of the story, Soderbergh plays Fletcher's wife's foreign lover, who speaks Italian, French and Japanese, and whose dialogue is subtitled. The various characters are distinct, yet they overlap. The dentist isn't Fletcher, yet he is. It would all be confusing, except we're not meant to understand Schizopolis. In its broad outlines, the film is just a whimsical riff. Where it excels is in its individual moments. At one point, Fletcher is talking to a man who takes out a cigarette. In a quick montage, we see the man on life support and finally in a coffin. More than mildly amusing, the sequence gets into Fletcher's head and captures the nature of the fleeting daydream. The context may be lightweight, yet Soderbergh uses it to extend the domain of cinema into aspects of reality that most filmmakers ignore. What Virginia Woolf did in words, Soderbergh does in pictures here. Other elements are just funny, and that's fine, too. The film's treatment of the self-help movement, Eventualism, is satirical and well observed. Though it would be hard to argue with anyone who wants to consider Schizopolis rambling and self-indulgent, it's also an unmistakably necessary film. It was necessary, no doubt, for Soderbergh to make it, but it's also necessary as a kind of antidote to all the ingratiating, dumbed-down cinema being pumped into the cultural air right now. For those able to find their way onto the Schizopolis wavelength, this is the most interesting film out there. ",1
" SCREAM 2: Slasher. Starring Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox. Directed by Wes Craven. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture, director Wes Craven's sequel to his surprise hit from last year, makes them fresh with a simple adjustment. The victims are as aware of slasher-movie conventions as we are. So when they flee down a hall, run into dead-ends or get weird phone calls, their horror is mixed with a disbelief at finding themselves in a situation they thought only happened in movies. Throughout Scream 2, Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson (Scream) have fun working that line between movie convention and reality. A sequence before the credits shows young people at a raucous screening of the slasher film Stab -- based on the events that took place in Scream. In the middle of a theater, a fatal stabbing takes place, but everybody in the crowd thinks it's a joke. Unlike Demons, a terrifying 1986 Italian film that also began at the screening of a horror movie, Scream 2 isn't particularly scary. It's eerie, sure, and there are a couple of jolts here and there -- a killer pops out from nowhere and the soundtrack crashes. But the picture works mainly as a nasty comedy. It takes place two years after the last Scream. Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in college, being courted by a sorority where the prissy sisters say things like, Hi! No, I really mean that -- hi! But the cozy college life can't last. A copycat killer, inspired by the release of Stab!, begins a rampage, slicing through campus. The level of violence keeps Scream 2 from being strictly a satire. There's nothing comic about the killings. When people get stabbed here, they get stabbed -- repeatedly and viciously, in a way that looks personal, and in a way that's difficult to watch. Though Craven satirizes horror cliches, he also knows how to cut through them and do new things. Throughout, the action comes unexpectedly and quickly. The killer calls and says, Hi, I'm in the house -- and bam, that killer is in that house, waving a knife around, within seconds. Craven can do things other directors can't -- or at least can't pull off nearly as well. He can frame a shot in such a way that, while a conversation takes place in the foreground, everyone in the audience will notice what is going on in the background. The sight of a grotesquely masked killer slipping unseen into a sorority house is the scariest sight of the film, a kind of visual metaphor for the darker aspects of the unconscious. The picture brings back Courteney Cox as tabloid TV reporter Gale Weathers, whose best-selling book formed the basis of the movie Stab. David Arquette also is back as Dewey, the deputy sheriff of Woodsboro. He walks with a limp now and can't lift his right arm, thanks to the wound he suffered in the last picture. Liev Schreiber, who appeared briefly in Scream, has a more substantial role here as Cotton Weary, who was falsely accused of the may hem in the first film. Williamson's script is funny and smart, with lots of in-jokes and knowing swipes at the media culture. In one scene, film students argue about which movie sequels were better than the originals. There are also a lot of cameo appearances by well-known young actors. In fact, most of the appearances in Scream 2 turn out to be cameos. The body count runs high. ",1
" SHAFT: Action. Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright and Christian Bale. Directed by John Singleton. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Actually the movie does lack one thing: a love scene. If the original Shaft, played by Richard Roundtree, was a complicated man understood by no one but his woman, the new Shaft is just a complicated man. He has no woman (just a female partner, played by Vanessa Williams). This Shaft does make himself understood, however -- by the audience, which can't help but follow every flicker of Jackson's face. Few film stars are able to make great acting this much fun to watch. When Jackson locks eyes with the villain -- a wacko, racist rich boy (Christian Bale) -- he is able to convey, just by the presence and intensity of his focus, all his thinking and being. He thinks the thought, and it's communicated. Totally loose and totally in command, he can go from flirtatious, to skeptical, to amused, to menacing in a matter of moments -- while making it look easy. It's not. In Shaft, Jackson presents a clear picture of a man who knows the street, knows the score and knows human frailty in all its depressing forms, and yet he's neither a cynic nor that other cliche, an idealist in the rough. He's something of more rarity and stature, an open-eyed man. He plays John Shaft, a police detective who is the nephew of the original John Shaft, played by Roundtree, who makes a handful of appearances here -- just enough to make the audience wish he had more to do. Bale (American Psycho) plays an unbalanced rich kid, Wade, who bludgeons a young man to death outside a bar. When he returns to New York, after two years hiding out in Europe, Shaft brings him into custody. But making arrests is easier than achieving justice. When Wade is released on bail, Shaft has to find the one witness to the crime -- a barmaid, played by Toni Collette -- before Wade has her killed. Shaft, written by novelist Richard Price, snowballs into one of those only-in-New York stories, in which a single act of violence is the catalyst for a series of violent episodes, involving dozens of people who had nothing to do with the original occurrence. Along the way, Price and Singleton take care to give every character his special moment. No one is made of cardboard. Even Wade is given a sort of mad-dog courage that, in another individual, might be considered admirable. The filmmakers save their best business, however, for Jeffrey Wright, who is brilliant and inspired as Peoples, a Dominican drug lord who wants to break into society. There is a wonderful scene in which Peoples tells Wade that he gets the shakes when he goes into downtown nightspots. He wants Wade to front for him, to sell cocaine to the Park Avenue crowd. Through Wright's performance, we understand that Peoples is motivated not by money but by a desire to break into the core of power. In those moments, we become seduced by his longing. He might be a two-bit dealer, the king of a three- block neighborhood, but were he born into other circumstances, he might have become a senator. Shaft balances moments of comedy with moments of unexpected terror. At other times, comedy and violence are mixed together: Arming himself to the teeth, Shaft announces, It's Giuliani time! In a shocking scene, almost played for laughs, Shaft cold-bloodedly pistol- whips a street hustler. This is an extremely violent film, with shootings, beatings, piles of bodies and one graphically rendered bludgeoning. In between killing off most of the cast, Singleton makes time for the splendid visual of Jackson, tall, bald and bad, walking down the street in his long black coat. Make no mis take, Shaft is still one bad whatever. But if ever there was a man in need of the humanizing influence of a little love and romance, it's this lonely, pistol-whipping cop. -- Advisory: Advisory: This film contains graphic violence. .. ",1
" STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT: Science fiction. Starring Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Alice Krige. Directed by Jonathan Frakes. (PG- 13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The first shot is a beauty. Captain Jean-Luc Picard is shown in a standing sleep as the camera pulls back and reveals that he is one of thousands of automatons, lined up like tiny candles in a vast cathedral. Picard is dreaming about the horror of having once been captured and enslaved by the Borg. These aliens, who have nothing to do with either tennis or Ernest Borgnine, are cybernetically enhanced creatures that take over people's minds and turn them into zombies, partaking of a collective consciousness. Now the Borg are back. Their mission is to enslave Earth, and to do so they travel back in time to the year 2063 to prevent Earth from making its first contact with ultra-civilized space beings. That's the whole premise of Star Trek: First Contact. The Borg want to prevent first contact and the Enterprise is there to make sure that history goes as scheduled. The fine quality of the new film is good news for anyone disappointed by Star Trek Generations, which got the new Star Trek feature film series off to a shaky start two years ago. In that one, Patrick Stewart (Picard) had the thankless task of having to contend with the presence of William Shatner, and no one contends with Shatner: One can only stand there like a straight man, while he twinkles and intones with the high spirits and high hair of a TV evangelist. The first film also had to deal with audience anger over the unglamorous killing of Captain Kirk: Something fell on him. Nothing glorious, nothing noble. A piece of hardware landed on the great Kirk, and we all knew why: It was to make way for Captain Picard -- stiff, unsmiling, and apparently unwilling to wear a funny toupee. But in Star Trek: First Contact Captain Picard comes fully into his own. This is a decent, complex, serious- minded captain, not the flashy kind who might impregnate half a galaxy, but an admirable man of moral cour age. I knew things were working when I, a Kirkhead from way back, actually felt a tingle of excitement as Picard pointed ahead and said, Engage! That's about all there is to understand in a Star Trek movie: Engage! -- and all that stuff to do with beaming up and beaming down. The rest is written in double-talk: They're transforming the deflector into an interflexing beacon! Translation: Something bad is happening. Along the way there's time for a space battle -- the Enterprise gets into a shooting match with the Borg ship, which looks like a bouillon cube. There's a lot of fun involving James Cromwell (the farmer in Babe), an alcoholic tinkerer who is skeptical when informed by the Enterprise crew that it's his destiny to make first contact with the aliens. The human side of this science- fiction story is nicely handled in the direction of Jonathan Frakes, who also plays Commander Riker. Stewart has a series of strong scenes with Alfre Woodard, who plays an Earth woman of the 21st century. And every scene involving the Borg Queen is a pleasure. Alice Krige as the Borg Queen, in fact, qualifies as the big revelation of Star Trek: First Contact. The Queen -- a sleek, slimy, sexy creature with no hair, just a few wires coming out of her skull -- is a role that calls for an actress with a great voice and a great face. Krige has both. Early in the film she captures Data (Brent Spiner) and spends the rest of the picture taking turns seducing and torturing him. But Krige is so appealing that it doesn't really seem like a bad way for Data to pass an afternoon. ",1
" SUMMER OF SAM: Drama. Starring John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody, Mira Sorvino and Jennifer Esposito. Directed by Spike Lee. (R. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Lee captures the glitz and the confusion of living in New York in 1977. The city was in the financial toilet. Crime seemed unstoppable. The sexual revolution seemed like a manifestation of end-of-the-world decadence and anarchy. And into the confusion came this homicidal maniac. Like the Littleton disaster years later, the most disturbing thing was that the killings didn't seem like something crazy from without. They seemed like an expression of a whole culture's sickness. Columnist Jimmy Breslin, one of the main reporters on the Son of Sam story, provides the movie's prologue and epilogue. On both sides of the film, Breslin says he loves and hates New York, and that point of view -- not so much at odds with itself as broad and complex -- comes through in Lee's film. Summer of Sam, which opens today, is less about the killings than it is about the effect they had on one Bronx neighborhood. John Leguizamo plays Vinny, who is married to Dionna (Mira Sorvino) but can't stop cheating on her. He sees the killings as a personal message from God: Stop cheating. Be a good husband. But he can't imagine it. The film does two things that would seem at cross-purposes. It creates a sense of a whole era, of its bigness, even its grandeur. Yet it also conveys the smallness of New York: the smallness of the mentality, the provincial neighborhoods, the apartments. In this way, serial killer David Berkowitz emerges as the ultimate New Yorker gone over the edge. His life has shrunk down to a bad apartment and a barking dog. Several scenes consist of nothing more than Berkowitz (Michael Badalucco) sticking his head under his pillow and screaming his head off, while a dog barks outside. Later the dog comes to Berkowitz in a halluci nation and, speaking English, tells him to kill people. These scenes are funny, and Lee knows it. No New York story can be true without a dash of absurdity. Vinny and his buddies live in a disco universe, but their friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody) is a punk rocker who is beginning to discover himself in Manhattan's downtown music scene. (His band is called Late Term Abortion.) The resentment that the neighborhood thugs feel toward Ritchie -- the clan's fear of the outsider -- is a big part of the movie. But it's not too big a part. The most refreshing thing about Summer of Sam is that it doesn't try to impose a moral or define the limits of its story. It takes its time. Out of nowhere, Lee will toss in a montage (to the Who's Baba O'Riley) of one character shooting heroin, another smoking pot; of Ritchie strumming his guitar, Reggie Jackson hitting a home run and Berkowitz going around killing people. In one sequence, Vinny and his wife drive to the punk club CBGB's, try to get into Studio 54 and end up at the sex club Plato's Retreat. It's an only-in-the-'70s night, and it's there, among other reasons, to give the flavor of the times. Lee's relaxed pace pays off. Virtually every scene plays out long enough to have some color. Leguizamo is terrific as a smooth fellow whose weakness of character is slowly making his life unravel, while Brody gives Ritchie a core of integrity underneath the ridiculous surface. Sorvino's best scenes are the wrenching arguments with Leguizamo. Jennifer Esposito comes into her own as the neighborhood slut, but then, all the performances are strong. Lee's pace allows even the minor characters richness and depth. The result is his best movie since Do the Right Thing. ",1
" Satire. Starring Jason Trost, Caitlyn Folley and Art Hsu. Directed by Brandon Trost and Jason Trost. (R. 83 minutes. At the Roxie Theater.) Think of The FP as the occasion for a party. You need to find a room full of people who get the joke and see this movie there, because audiences will be laughing so hard they'll be screaming.  I saw The FP by myself, on a DVD, and for about two minutes, they had me fooled. I thought I was watching the worst movie I've ever seen. But no. The FP is deadpan hilarious, a shameless satire of every teen gang, future-shock dystopian nightmare movie - combined with a brutal send-up of 8 Mile. Two rival gangs battle it out for control of a dingy suburb, in a near future in which people are even more crass and tasteless than they are now. The casual cursing in The FP is off-the-charts and hysterical. Jason Trost, who co-wrote and co-directed with his brother Brandon Trost, has a young Clint Eastwood vibe as the man who tries to restore order to his hometown. Everything is good for a laugh in this picture, but the thing I found the most side-splitting is the relationship between the hero and the girl of his dreams (Caitlyn Folley), who is presented as so loose, trashy and downtrodden that she makes the late Brittany Murphy in 8 Mile look like Ingrid Bergman.",1
" Sci-fi action. Starring Aaron Eckhart and Michelle Rodriguez. Directed by Jonathan Liebesman. (PG-13. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Battle: Los Angeles takes a big what would happen if premise - in this case, a massive alien invasion - and then fulfills that premise by taking it seriously. Not self-seriously. The movie is lots of fun, but it stays true to the terms it establishes, telling the story through the eyes of one Marine platoon assigned to rescue civilians in Santa Monica. In this way, we see the aliens only as the guys see them - first, in just brief glimpses, then later, in intimate and grotesque detail. We get acclimated to battle. And the whole time we feel the anxiety of knowing we're only getting a piece of the story, that other battles are waging, on the East Coast, in Paris, in London, in Japan, and that victory seems almost inconceivable.  Battle: Los Angeles is not in the big-picture, crowd-pleasing tradition of Independence Day. Think of it as The Hurt Locker of alien invasion movies. By putting us down on the ground with the guys, the situation becomes more unsettling, more disorienting, and the scenario presented feels more like how a thing like this might actually happen: First reports of meteor showers. Then more meteor showers. Then, wait, are those really meteor showers? And then, Oh no! Essential to the movie's success is Aaron Eckhart, who plays a Marine staff sergeant as though he were in a World War II movie: no camping it up, no comedy, no winking at the audience, no smiling. He's just a tough guy, with lots of emotional scars, who is very good at his job. Eckhart's commitment to the movie's reality, which is as fierce as the sergeant's commitment to his men, takes what otherwise might merely have been outlandish and makes it believable, and frightening.  They're trying to colonize us - these gangly, big-headed, spindly creatures - and how do you fight something you don't even want to look at? And how do you fight weapons you don't even understand? The aliens have a fighter plane that looks like a flying Christmas wreath, in which each pine needle is either a light or some kind of laser death ray. Tell an audience this, and it means nothing. But put viewers in the midst of a battle and have something like this suddenly loom above the frame, and it feels a lot more personal.  Context is everything: The special effects are probably excellent, but the truth is, you won't have time to appraise them as special effects, with the reality of the movie bearing down on you at all times.  So, apparently, San Francisco and San Diego folded up like cheap handkerchiefs, and Los Angeles is the last human stronghold on the West Coast. Say what you will about L.A., but it's good for alien fighting - mostly flat and spread out, with lots of neighborhoods, unattached houses and wide streets. It also has plenty of gas stations, which can be useful whenever an incendiary moment is called for. Christopher Bertolini's screenplay isn't big on witty repartee, but he takes time to introduce each character, and throughout Bertolini and director Jonathan Liebesman find ways to define every phase of the catastrophe in human terms. No shortcuts were taken in the crafting of the story. The filmmakers repeatedly set up expectations, thwart them and come up with something far worse and more agonizing than you expect.  The filmmakers don't make it easy on their characters. Even better, they don't make it easy on themselves, and best of all, they don't make it easy on us. The battle in Battle: Los Angeles is grab-the-armrest tense until the last seconds. -- Advisory: The aliens are ugly, and there are a lot of dead bodies. But these have to be the politest, cleanest-talking Marines ever. They don't even curse at the aliens. They want to take back Los Angeles while avoiding an R rating.",1
" Sci-fi comedy. Starring Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Jason Bateman, Blythe Danner and the voice of Seth Rogen. Directed by Greg Mottola. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) People who know they'd like a movie about two comic-book geeks who meet up with an alien already know they want to see Paul. So this is addressed to people who are not in that category, who are not particularly interested in comic books, geeks or aliens: This is a well-made, well-plotted and sensitive movie. Paul was directed by Greg Mottola, who was 3-for-3 going into this film and is now 4-for-4. His previous movies - The Daytrippers, Superbad and Adventureland - demonstrated his capacity for depicting the longings of misfit characters, an ability that comes into play here. Mottola started out in independent films, but he doesn't lose his soul when confronted with big budgets. He has a humane vision. He is not prone to harsh judgments. And he knows how to elicit big laughs, while not compromising the reality and fullness of his characters. If you're looking for an example of Mottola's taste and directorial instinct, notice how he directs Blythe Danner, who shows up two-thirds of the way into Paul as a woman who had an alien encounter as a child and whose subsequent life was damaged as a result. Every indication of the script would suggest that this little featured role be played for comedy. Instead, it's as if Danner has been told that she is acting in a serious drama. Instead of becoming discordant, the performance provides a dimension of sorrow that adds immeasurably to the movie's richness.  Most of Paul concerns two fellows from England, Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost), who come to the United States for a comic-book convention, then go on a trip to UFO sites in the Southwest. Before they even meet the alien, which happens within minutes, they've already charmed the audience with their ingenuousness, their goofy delight in being in America and their very lived-in, long-term friendship. Indeed, Graeme and Clive are so pleasant to be around that it feels like an iron-footed imposition when the movie introduces Paul, who looks like every movie alien you've seen for the past 40 years: He's little and thin, bigheaded and diamond eyed. He starts talking and out comes the deep voice of Seth Rogen, and, for just a few minutes, there's an uh-oh feeling that maybe Paul, after an engaging opening, is about to derail into the obvious and sophomoric. But the script, by Pegg and Frost, is strong, full of incident and propulsion. Paul is on the run from the U.S. government agents who'd like to dispose of him (or at least keep him prisoner), while he just wants to go home. The movie's references to the Steven Spielberg movies (Close Encounters, E.T.) are intentional and integrated within the world of the film - Paul, apparently, worked as an uncredited consultant for Spielberg, and Spielberg himself (or rather his voice) turns up in a funny cameo.  The clever script finds humor in fresh pop culture references and in people's terror of the anal probe, something they assume all aliens want to do to them. But essentially Paul is a chase movie, with a government agent, in the form of Jason Bateman, doing everything he can to track down Paul before he makes his escape. Even in a fairly one-note role, Bateman's dual nature, his way of playing two actions at once (what he's doing, and what he's really thinking) is a distinct asset.  Kristen Wiig perhaps benefits most from working with Mottola. As a conservative fundamentalist whose entire worldview transforms after she meets Paul, Wiig is in a role that could have been pure satire. But she plays every moment for truth and comes up with a characterization that's honest and nuanced and much funnier than it ever could have been otherwise. -- Advisory: This film contains drug use.Review",1
" Sci-fi romantic comedy. Starring Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss. Directed by Charlie McDowell. (R. 91 minutes.)On a story level, the thing that gives The One I Love its distinct appeal is that it brings together unexpected elements. It's a romantic comedy and a relationship drama, but it's also a science fiction movie with some potentially sinister implications. It's probably the only love story you'll see this decade that will make you half-expect the camera to swerve and pick up the sight of Rod Serling, standing there in a black suit.  On a deeper level, what makes The One I Love satisfying is that it isn't weird for the sake of weird. Screenwriter Justin Laden may very well have devised the film as a gimmick, but it certainly doesn't seem that way. Instead it seems as though he had serious things he wanted to say about struggling couples and turned to sci-fi as the most expressive means of saying them. The result is that the sci-fi touch adds a quirkiness and lightheartedness to a vision that's only slightly more optimistic than Ingmar Bergman's. From the beginning, the movie points the audience in the direction of uncomfortable truths. When we meet Sophie (Elisabeth Moss) and Ethan (Mark Duplass), they are trying to rekindle their marriage by revisiting a legendary scene from their courtship. We've seen scenes like this before. Of course, things go awry, as they usually do in movies, but in this case the situation blows up completely. It becomes an occasion for self-loathing, mutual resentment and doubt. Director Charlie McDowell finds the right tone, somewhere between funny and disturbing. Most of the action takes place at a bucolic getaway, where the unhappy couple goes to work on the relationship. Very quickly, things begin to get strange, but the less said about the nature of that strangeness, the better.  Usually, the one given of a marital drama is that the audience believes that the couple should stay together. But The One I Love is sophisticated enough to leave that an open question for most of the way. Indeed, that specific question is really the movie's area of investigation. We're presented with a couple that is beyond listening to each other. They no longer seem to believe in the other person's virtue or specialness. And every positive association they have about each other is related to some past memory, when everything was new and they were both on their best behavior. So should they stay together? And if they do, what can they still expect to find? Moss' combination of surface sweetness and watchful coldness - of studied placidity and cutthroat honesty - is right in line with the movie's aura. And Duplass brings in the comedy, in a performance that ranges from slapstick to menace. ",1
" Science fiction. Starring Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Marc Webb. (PG-13. 142 minutes.) All the usual hedges and qualifications don't apply to The Amazing Spider-Man 2, that it's good if you like comic book movies, or fantasy action movies. Instead we find a very modern blockbuster that mixes the best of old and new. It has action sequences that will appeal to people looking for the usual pyrotechnics, but the core of the movie - and the source of the audience's interest - is emotion. This is the case from the movie's first minute, which grabs the audience and plunges it into a high-stakes situation in which all the big emotional buttons are pressed - the love between parent and child, the love between wife and husband. In a flashback, we follow Peter Parker's parents in their first hours on the run from the law. They leave Peter with his aunt and uncle and soon find themselves fighting for their lives on board a private plane.  This is followed by another splashy action sequence, set in the present, involving a heist of plutonium, which gives us a chance to see Peter/Spider-Man in action, fighting crime on the streets of New York. The special effects have improved just in the last 10 years, so that when Spider-Man dives off a skyscraper and swings from building to building, he no longer looks like a stick figure bobbing around a computer screen. Instead the plummets bring on a feeling of vertigo. Even here, with back-to-back action scenes, there's no sense of the arbitrary about The Amazing Spider-Man 2, no feeling as if the narrative is standing still while the filmmakers blow things up. The story is always moving forward, and it's always the story of a person - a young man who wants to do the right thing but finds himself dealing with unusual pressures and responsibilities. If he doesn't fight crime, the city falls apart. If he does, the police and press criticize him.  His most intense anxiety surrounds his girlfriend, Gwen (Emma Stone). At the end of the previous installment, he agreed to her father's last request - that for her safety, Peter should stay away from her. But their bond and their attraction are too intense to ignore, and anybody in the audience can see that this relationship just seems right. Garfield and Stone's rapport is appealing and unmistakable. They're physically at home with each other, and their conversations feel extemporaneous. Garfield and Stone are a couple offscreen, and here's a case where a real-life romance enhances the performances and benefits the movie. The idea of two young people who desperately want to be together - who can't stay away from each other and yet somehow probably should - this situation has been engaging the passions and sympathies of audiences for at least 2,000 years. When Stone and Garfield are together onscreen, they practically glow. At the same time, the movie deftly reminds us, at every turn, that their relationship could be dangerous, and Peter's anxiety becomes ours. How rare it is with an action blockbuster to come out talking about the characters and the actors and not about explosions. Even apart from the two leads, the acting is notably good, which means that director Marc Webb deserves praise. Embeth Davidtz probably doesn't have 10 lines in the entire movie, but she lingers in the mind as Peter's mother, as does Campbell Scott as her husband. Sally Field brings the full Sally package to her role as Peter's aunt, playing the character's emotional circumstances with the same intensity that she brought to Mary Lincoln.Jamie Foxx makes an interesting character of Max Dillon/Electro, an electrical whiz whose needy nerdiness turns dangerous when he takes on superpowers. It's on Foxx's face, even as he's blasting dozens of police cars with electricity: He just wants to be loved. Most promising of all, given where the story must go, is Dane DeHaan as the young billionaire Harry Osborn. He's charming, damaged and arrogant, vulnerable but vindictive, potentially a fine fellow, and yet one with just enough of a skew in his character to allow for horrible possibilities. The special effects are seamless, so that the effects are felt without any notice of their being special. It just seems natural that Foxx should be able to go from a solid to an electrostatic state and back again, and that this should look as normal as anything else. As for the 3-D, see it that way if you particularly like 3-D, but it's not important to the movie. The plunges off buildings will work just as well in two dimensions. ",1
" Shakespearean drama. Starring Ralph Fiennes, Gerard Butler, Brian Cox, Vanessa Redgrave and Jessica Chastain. Directed by Ralph Fiennes. (R. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Though not the most lovable, Ralph Fiennes is certainly a great actor, with a seemingly impassive lizard-like gaze and the suggestion of some inner cruelty. These stern qualities are offset by something soft behind the eyes - some doubt or fellow feeling that he seemingly doesn't want to show, but does. This is what Fiennes' characters hide behind the wall of intelligence, arrogance and functionality.  In his first film as a director, Fiennes proves that he knows Fiennes the actor inside out, with a self-knowledge that's rare, even admirable. He takes on the title role in Coriolanus, one that is, appropriately enough, not the most lovable of Shakespeare's tragic heroes, but clearly some type of great man. Coriolanus is an almost insanely capable general, someone you would certainly want on your side, but one who is also vain and condescending and considers even social niceties to be a compromise of his inner core. Fiennes transposes Coriolanus to a dystopian fantasy modern world, in which Rome is a fascist state, beset by wars and the threat of wars and with hungry citizens marching in the street for food. For about 15 minutes, this updating, replete with characters speaking iambic pentameter on a cable news network, might seem like a gimmick. It's not. It also might seem like some type of labored commentary on the modern world. It's not that, either. Fiennes is after something else. Put simply, he puts Coriolanus into modern times so that we can see the story for what it is. Lifted from the context of an earlier age, the violence becomes violence, not historical tableau. And the family culture of Coriolanus, instead of seeming noble yet primitive, seems borderline crazy: He is the product of a magnetic and persuasive mother (Vanessa Redgrave) who values military success above all else - a rare sort of mom who is happy to hear that her son has been wounded, because it will add to his honor and political power. Coriolanus is a monster of proficiency in armed combat, but he's unsuited to political life. The character's vanity and hair-trigger temper are built into the role. Fiennes brings out the emotions and motives underneath, how going through the motions in the public sphere is painful to him. Knowing the truth of the battlefield, he sees everything else as a lie - and he can't bring himself to become a liar.  Fiennes thrives under his own direction, but such is his sense of balance that everyone else thrives, too: Redgrave is scarily charming and rational, as Coriolanus' rock-ribbed mother. Brian Cox is the film's locus of probity and decency, as Rome's lone honest politician. Jessica Chastain brings a naturalness to Shakespeare's verse, as Coriolanus' young wife, and Gerard Butler makes the curious but effective choice of playing Coriolanus' chief military rival, Aufidius, as relaxed and engaging. As a personality, Aufidius has everything that Coriolanus doesn't have - an inner ease and the love of his people. But as a general, so long as Coriolanus is alive, he will always be second best.",1
" Spy thriller drama. Starring Helen Mirren, Jessica Chastain, Tom Wilkinson, Sam Worthington and Marton Csokas. Directed by John Madden. (R. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Thrillers are usually about some crisis playing out in the heat of a moment, and The Debt has that aspect, for sure. It is an exciting movie, full of crises and dramatic turns despite an aura of sadness that seems to pervade it. Featuring the same characters in two time periods separated by 30 years, it has a quality of reflection - even contemplation - built into its design, as it finds time to consider the lingering effects of World War II, the nature of evil and the compromises that often arise despite the best of intentions. At the center of The Debt is a woman, played by two actresses, Helen Mirren and Jessica Chastain. As the older Rachel, lauded in Israel and throughout the world for bringing down a Nazi butcher in the mid-1960s, Mirren evinces no pleasure or satisfaction at her historic exploits and exalted reputation. She just seems burdened and turned inward, like someone who has been traumatized but can never speak of the things she has seen, or done. Being Mirren, Rachel is a mask and yet eminently readable in all her fluctuations of disdain, regret, self-disgust and fear. Once Mirren shows us who Rachel has become, it then falls to Chastain to show how Rachel got that way - which, in practical terms, becomes something not unlike showing us how Jessica Chastain becomes Helen Mirren. The beginning of Mirren's performance is Chastain's psychological endpoint, and she charts the course meticulously, putting her own stamp on the character while subtly evoking Mirren's manner and inner life. Chastain, a relative newcomer, was strongly featured in The Tree of Life, but a Malick film is not about acting but about becoming part of a design. This is the film in which Chastain gets to show her stuff, and she is an actress to watch.  After an introduction, set in 1997, the movie goes back in time to the mid-1960s, when Rachel (Chastain) and two fellow Israeli Mossad agents (Sam Worthington and Marton Csokas) slipped into East Germany to kidnap a Mengele-like Nazi doctor, played with eerie confidence by the Danish actor Jesper Christensen. As the doctor is working in East Berlin as a gynecologist, this means Rachel's submitting to an exam - an intimate exam by a Nazi doctor. John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) would not be a director worth talking about if he didn't know how to take a situation like that and make your skin crawl.  The agents in The Debt are tough. They're devoted to fighting evil. But somehow in her subsequent encounters with evil, Rachel is surprised by it, that the doctor is without remorse, that he is emotionally sadistic, that he has no regrets, that he is, in fact, quite happy with himself and that this gives him a peculiar strength that can't be broken. And she thought evil would be comprehensible, or banal. No such luck. It's her first depressing life lesson, with more in store.Most of the screen time, as well as most of the heavy dramatic lifting, gets filled by the trio of younger actors, in the mid-1960s section, though Mirren's fans will be glad to know that she returns with a vengeance in the last act. In the 1960s, the war seemed far off, but it was part of living history. By 1997, it was becoming the stuff of legend, and Mirren shows us the strain of someone embodying the legend while living with the reality, in memory, every minute of every day. It's a sober, angry and dignified performance.",1
" Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Campbell Scott and Matthew Broderick. Directed by Alan Rudolph. (R. 127 minutes.) The picture, directed by Alan Rudolph, is a strange concoction -- not your standard Hollywood product. It floats along, giving us scenes from Parker's life, occasionally flashing forward to show Leigh as the older Parker reciting her poetry. From her early days, as a theater critic for Vanity Fair, to her later years as an alcoholic wreck, Parker's life is no walk in the park. Its repetition -- the drinking and smoking, writing and rutting -- is the film's real vicious circle.  Yet what a wonderful, detailed portrait. And what an evocation of a time and a mood. Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle is truly one of those films that inhabits its own world. Though many of Parker's well- known wisecracks make their way into the screenplay, Mrs. Parker ultimately does not give us the Dorothy Parker of legend. ",1
" Suspense drama. Starring Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Rachel McAdams, Helen Mirren, Robin Wright Penn and Jason Bateman. Directed by Kevin Macdonald. (PG-13. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)If we were to begin at the beginning, a conversation about State of Play might start with the literate, witty script or the exceptional cast. Or we might talk about director Kevin Macdonald's ability to create and sustain a mood of anxiety. Or we might discuss the powerful and timely subject - the government's increased reliance on mercenary security companies - or the movie's appealing celebration of print journalism. But any real conversation about State of Play has to start with the thing that most stands out about it, and that's the ending - one of the most misbegotten and ill conceived in memory. Don't worry, no details will be given here, but to review the film without commenting on the elephant in the room would make no sense. I've been going to the movies since my mother took me to A Hard Day's Night in 1964, and I don't think I've ever quite seen a movie fall so quickly and from such heights as State of Play. Bad endings; pat endings; disappointing endings; downer endings; cliched endings; predictable, goofy-happy endings - these are common, but we're not talking about anything like those here. For about 115 minutes, State of Play tells an alarming, tightly constructed story, with serious things to say about journalism and the state of the country. The movie appears to be all but over - and likely to stand as one of the best films of 2009. And then the filmmakers add one last embellishment, and they blow it. It's as if Macdonald and screenwriters Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray collectively lost track of the story and fell in love with plot for the sake of plot. In its last few minutes, State of Play contracts. Its story becomes less important, its message lost, its purpose muddled and confused. Moreover, if you backtrack from the ending and think it through, it collapses altogether, with characters knowing things they wouldn't have known and doing things they wouldn't have done. It's the worst of both worlds: Not only is the ending of State of Play no fun, but it makes no sense. Still, would the Mona Lisa be wrecked if someone drew a mustache on it? Probably not, if you consider that State of Play remains a thing of beauty most of the way through. For almost two hours, any time a journalist or honest politician heads out the door, the audience tenses up with fear of what might be out there. Russell Crowe plays an old-school reporter who hooks up with Rachel McAdams, a blogger with reporting aspirations, and State of Play becomes a story of two people with a line on the truth - a truth that can change the course of history. The trick is they have to stay alive long enough to file the story.Their investigation centers on the death (murder? suicide?) of a congressional aide who was researching the inner workings of a private security company on behalf of a crusading young congressman (Ben Affleck). To complicate matters, she was also having an affair with the congressman, and of course that's the angle that most of the media wants to run with. But the old-school reporter sees something deeper and more sinister at work, and he starts digging. Rumpled, rugged, focused - fundamentally decent - knowing and yet innocent in a way good reporters sometimes are - Crowe is the perfect study of the middle-aged, midcareer print journalist, whose skills aren't flashy, just essential to a democracy. His boss is played by Helen Mirren, who is like no editor I've ever seen, but is wonderfully like, well, Helen Mirren, ballsy, harried, irreverent, funny. In smaller but essential roles are Robin Wright Penn (one of our best actresses, folks), subtle and yet emotionally full as the congressman's wife; and Jason Bateman, terrific as a sleazy publicist. Up against this company, McAdams sometimes washes out, but then she's the cub reporter, whose job is to watch and learn. She does - and so does McAdams.The struggle of newspapers to survive informs the script, and there are wisecracks galore extolling print at the Internet's expense. These are welcome, particularly in a movie that for a time seems as if it's going to be the best newspaper picture since All the President's Men. It would have been so nice to be able to write that.-- Advisory: Strong violence and harsh language.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.EXTRA!

" TEA WITH MUSSOLINI: Romance. Starring Cher, Joan Plowright, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Baird Wallace. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli. (PG. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Everyone's life should be that way. First lived, then dramatized. It's certainly appropriate for Zeffirelli, whose devotion to art, while at times self-conscious, has been lifelong and passionate. Tea With Mussolini, which opens today, stars five terrific actresses who are older than 50. That's the first thing most people will mention about the movie, but that makes it sound like medicine or an equal- opportunity initiative. In fact, it's warm, spontaneous and heartfelt. Zeffirelli cared about his memories, and he's done justice to them. The second thing to mention is Cher, who is wonderful in the film. Cher hasn't had an important role in years, but Tea With Mussolini should turn things around for her. I've never been a fan. But with this movie I finally got Cher. It's a role that allows her to be seen, that lets her create a vivid character while showing off what is best about her as a screen personality. She plays Elsa, a former showgirl and successful gold-digger turned art collector. She wants Picasso's Les Demoiselles D'Avignon. She wants it, wants it, wants it. At first she seems like a likable but capricious person who wants art for the sake of having it. But there are depths to this lady, and gradually one understands her as someone with a natural and unfettered appreciation of art and life. Tea With Mussolini is the story of a boy who grows up with a worthless Italian daddy and a half-dozen English-speaking mommies. When his mother dies, young Luca comes under the care of Mary (Joan Plowright), who is one of a clique of middle-aged British ladies living in Florence. Plowright gets to do more than imitate Margaret Dumont in this one. Mary, an unusually sweet person, has the sort of kind eyes that a little boy blossoms under. When she takes the boy to see the great statuary of Florence, part of the power of the moment comes from knowing that the boy represents Zeffirelli, whose own contributions to art -- as both filmmaker and opera director -- will be estimable. The connection is emphasized by the casting of two boys, as the 12-year-old and teenage Luca respectively, who bear a considerable resemblance to Zeffirelli. The teenage Luca (Baird Wallace) even sounds like him. Later, Mary teaches him the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, the play Zeffirelli would later make into one of cinema's great literary adaptations. Tea With Mussolini captures the strange manners and interactions of these ladies, who take high tea and occupy a world within a world in Florence. The title comes from the scene in which the snooty Lady Hester (Maggie Smith), the late British ambassador's wife, has tea with her hero, Il Duce. Judi Dench has a smaller role as an emotional, dog-loving restorer of paintings. Lily Tomlin is mainly in the background, but she has her moments as an openly lesbian archaeologist. Plowright is lovely, but somehow it's Cher who lingers in the mind when the film is over. She suggests an intelligence behind the free-spirited Elsa, a wisdom partly innate but earned, too. No one can be that generous without having gone through rough times, but she's too classy to show it. Playing the essence of good times, lewdness and open-hearted enthusiasm, Cher manages to embody all those frivolous virtues that Mussolini's fascists were intent on destroying. ",1
" THAT THING YOU DO!: Comedy/drama. Starring Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler and Tom Hanks. Directed by Tom Hanks. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture, which opens today, is well- made and entertaining, but it holds a special interest in what it says about Hanks. This comes as a surprise, since the offscreen Hanks has never seemed all that interesting. Talented and likable, yes, but not someone to spend time thinking about. But Hanks has a story to tell and things to say about fame in this tale of four fine rock-'n'-rollin' lads from middle America. That Thing You Do! can be seen as Hanks' look back, as a disguised midlife self-assessment. Obvious care went into the scene in which the band first hears its song playing on the radio. Within minutes, the band members have all converged on the appliance store where one of them works. Music blares. They're hugging, dancing, laughing. It's a moment of pure joy, in which it seems things can only get better. But in fact this elation can never be duplicated. Four guys make up the band, but as is usually the case, only two of them matter. Johnathon Schaech plays Jimmy, the songwriter and lead singer of the Wonders. Jimmy's dedication and seriousness is contrasted with the easygoing good nature of Guy, the band's drummer. The cliche in rock movies is that the manager is a villain, exploiting the creativity of the sensitive artist. But That Thing You Do! isn't painted in such crude strokes. While Jimmy seems to have legitimate concerns about the marketing of the Wonders -- particularly after they're forced to wear goofy outfits in a beach party movie -- his concerns may be over blown. And though Mr. White (Hanks) is an old-school promoter without a feel for the special honesty that rock 'n' roll demands, he has things to teach these kids. It's disconcerting to see Hanks as the gruff mentor, but he does it well. That Thing You Do! announces the maturity of the 40- year-old Hanks, who has spent a dozen or so years looking 30. As Mr. White, he's heavier and tougher, and always seems sure of himself. Perhaps Hanks is drawing on his own experiences with no-nonsense showbiz professionals, remembering people he knew on the way up. In any case, Mr. White takes a paternal interest in Guy, who's the type of character Hanks might have played 10 years ago. In fact, Tom Everett Scott, who plays Guy, actually resembles Hanks. The focus on Guy gives the film a fascinating undercurrent, as though Hanks were working out some thoughts about himself as a young man. It also takes the movie in a unique direction. By unexpectedly concentrating on a more laid-back member of the band, the film becomes something other than a run-of-the-mill story of struggle and achievement. It becomes a statement of values. That Thing You Do! suggests that the right attitude toward fame consists of distance, a sense of humor and a love for that thing you do. The film captures the early-'60s milieu of rock 'n' roll road shows and screaming teeny-boppers. At one point, Hanks even employs a whimsical montage that's straight out of a '60s movie. The cars and the appliances all have that glossy, heavy, made-in-the-USA look. The music, all of it written for the film, sounds authentic. The title song is played about 10 times during the movie -- an audacious choice that could have spelled disaster were the song not so catchy. Liv Tyler (Stealing Beauty) plays the girlfriend of one of the band members, and she not only doesn't stink up the joint but she also does a good job. She even survives Hanks' worst dialogue, a heavy-handed speech in which she tells her boyfriend that she shouldn't have believed his smiles and kisses, because his smiles and kisses were insincere.

" THE ARRIVAL: Thriller. Starring Charlie Sheen and Ron Silver. Directed by David Twohy. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet for the past 20 years Hollywood has offered us an array of cuddly aliens, creatures with nothing better to do than travel light- years to hang out with Drew Barrymore and tell us we should love each other and not screw up the environment. The Arrival, a deeply creepy science fiction thriller that opens today, signals a change. The aliens in this one may be smarter than we are, but they're not nice. Charlie Sheen plays a brilliant NASA scientist -- wait, don't stop reading. Scientist Zane Zaminsky (Sheen) is a bug-eyed fellow with a Van Dyke beard and his hair standing on end, who one day comes across what seems to be a radio signal from outer space. He tells his boss (Ron Silver) about it and is promptly fired for being a nut. Firing him just makes this mad scientist madder. He becomes obsessed with trying to find out the nature of the radio signal. When he figures out that people are out to stop him, he wants to know the reasons for that, too. The scientist's single-mindedness drives The Arrival. It takes him into an eerie Mexican village where he teams up with an American professor doing fieldwork on the environment (Lindsay Crouse). It also leads him into hand-to-hand combat with some scary aliens. The Arrival was created by David Twohy, a screenwriter (Waterworld, The Fugitive) making his feature debut as writer-director. It's a strong, lean piece of writ ing that moves quickly. Nothing is wasted, and nothing happens the way you'd expect. Twohy is able to make the sight of water dripping down a wall seem ominous, and he's completely in control of scenes like the one in which a woman prepares for bed not knowing that scorpions are creeping under the sheets. The aliens look much like aliens in other movies -- they're thin, with big eyes and big heads. (You rarely see a chubby alien.) Yet these are ugly enough to make your skin crawl. Their heads have lobes, which flop in the breeze. And the joint in their knees goes backward, so when they're walking it looks as if they're heading the other way. You'd be surprised how unsettling that is. Sheen isn't ideally cast in the role of a scientist, but he maintains a high level of intensity and does what he has to do. The Arrival has intelligence and mood, and this time of year you have to take that where you find it. ",1
" THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE: Supernatural thriller. Starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron. Directed by Rand Ravich. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is not a metaphor for a bad marriage but rather the actual premise of The Astronaut's Wife, which opened yesterday. Johnny Depp goes into space and comes back just a little bit weird. His wife, played by Charlize Theron, has to deal with it. The Astronaut's Wife is a major release that wasn't screened in advance for critics. That usually portends disaster, but that's not the case this time. The film is as good as or better than the average Hollywood release. It's scary. It's well-acted. It's filmed with a degree of flash and elegance. About the only negative thing that can be said about it is that it doesn't quite satisfy at the finish. The script needs something more -- I'm not pretending to know what it is. But the ending leaves the audience with an empty feeling and a few nagging questions: Who is this alien? Where is he from? What does he want? Until that point, The Astronaut's Wife is a strong thriller. Depp plays a shuttle astronaut who loses contact with NASA for two minutes. The mission is terminated, and he's brought back to earth. He is the same as ever, except that he no longer wants to be a pilot. And he's rough with his wife in bed. The story has more than a passing resemblance to Rosemary's Baby. The wife gets pregnant with twins and begins to wonder what exactly she is carrying. Joe Morton has a nice role as a NASA scientist driven to the brink of madness by figuring out that the astronaut is an alien. Depp is fine, though the one-note role calls for him to be only calm and spooky. As the wife, Theron gets the real emotional workout, and she's up to it. In fact, the strength of her performance seduces director Rand Ravich to leave in more of it than necessary. She has a couple of breakdowns that stretch on needlessly. The picture shows signs of heavy editing -- lines heard in the movie's trailer are not in the finished film. The movie might not be perfect, but it deserved better than to be dumped into theaters. I rather enjoyed it. ",1
" THE BEACH: Drama. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Virginie Ledoyen and Tilda Swinton. Directed by Danny Boyle. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture features a community of young travelers in an unidentified tropical paradise who all live together in a big house. It's not a commune. It's more an idealized dormitory. Everyone is young and good-looking, and they cavort on the beach all day. If any movie was ever ripe for a Mad magazine parody, it's this one. Yet The Beach, which opens today at Bay Area theaters, taps into something powerful that can't be overwhelmed by individual moments of silliness. So what if they're all smoking filtered cigarettes, even though they haven't been off the island in years? So what if it looks as though some of them have been using a curling iron on their hair? Based on Alex Garland's cult best-seller, The Beach is about a dream of youth, and the dream eventually sneaks up on the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio -- looking strapping and adult, finally -- plays Richard, an American traveler who is searching for something real in his life. He finds his path in Thailand, when a raving, suicidal maniac (Robert Carlyle) gives him a map to a paradise where the water is perfect, the beach is perfect and everybody is happy. So young Richard goes off on his journey, accompanied by a French couple, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet), whose name DiCaprio can't seem to pronounce. At times he seems to be calling him ATM, at other times Auntie Em. French is not DiCaprio's strong suit. Most of the picture takes place on the island community, made up of young people who are extremely cheerful, even though they've done without toilet paper for years. I found my vocation -- the pursuit of pleasure, the hero says in voice- over. But, in fact, the most moving thing about the island community is that it seems so mundane. The people do nothing but hang out. Paradise is little more than college without classes. Then again, college without classes might be a kind of paradise. That is the sweet thing about The Beach. At 22, what do people want more than to be with friends? And what do they dread more than separation and years of hard work? The Beach is about nothing but the longing to stay young. DiCaprio, who just now is beginning to look like a man, is ideal for the role. The picture is also honest about the consequences of a society based entirely on pleasure. The Beach is not Lord of the Flies, about the horrors that occur when civilization breaks down on a remote island. Rather, it's about the horrors attending the emergence of a civilization. Tilda Swinton plays the leader of the community. As the queen in a village of children, she is a bit remote, and as the choices become tougher, she becomes cold-blooded. Pleasure is a selfish pursuit. She ends up re-enacting in miniature some of the cruelties associated with the outside world. The Beach is not all dour. The voice-over narration -- a weak aspect of many films -- is a strong point. The observations are shrewd and biting, and DiCaprio has the right cynical edge. There are also moments of real beauty. Francoise and Richard walk along a deserted beach at night and notice plankton in the water. If they're disturbed, they glow, she says, so the two go splashing in the ocean and have their first kiss in this magical light. Who knew director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) had it in him? The Beach is not a movie to think about. When Swinton talks about going to the mainland to trade marijuana for rice, it's hard not to snicker. Rather, it's a movie to feel. Even when the thinking isn't all there, the emotions are, all the way to the film's poignant last seconds. .. ",1
" THE BIG TEASE: Comedy. Starring Craig Ferguson, Frances Fisher and David Rasche. Directed by Kevin Allen. (R. 100 minutes. At the Metreon.) Craig Ferguson, a regular on The Drew Carey Show, co-wrote and stars in this film about a Scottish hairstylist who comes to Los Angeles for a hairstyling competition. He is the biggest thing in Glasgow, but when he gets to Los Angeles, he finds out he wasn't invited to compete. He was invited to be only a spectator. The filmmakers -- Sacha Gervasi co-wrote it and Kevin Allen (Twin Town) directed -- create a silly world and then do something smart with it: They invest in its reality and its emotions. The result: Though we might not otherwise care about the Golden Scissors competition, we want our hero to get into it and win. It's a nice line, and The Big Tease, which opens today, walks it. Ferguson takes a realistic approach to the role of the hairstylist, Crawford Mackenzie. He makes Crawford gay in a way that would be obvious to most people, but he doesn't play a caricature. Crawford is a big, engaging fellow who, like a lot of people, comes to Hollywood expecting to become a star. Once he gets there, he's too embarrassed to go home. Interspersed throughout the film, we get snippets of mock documentary footage -- Crawford is so sure of his success that he arrives in California with a documentary filmmaker. Crawford's mother is seen on camera, talking about when she first realized her son was special. It was, she says, when she gave him a chess set and he dressed up all the pieces in little skirts. In another bit, Crawford is shown in an introspective moment, look ing out from his hotel balcony singing California Dreaming to himself. What makes it funny is that he tries to sing the lead and the backing vocals simultaneously: All the leaves are -- all the leaves are brown . . . The Big Tease is about a guy looking for the Hollywood Dream, which is not just about success, but about glamour, stardom and all- around gloriousness. Doors slam in his face. He is dismissed in the way people without power are dismissed in Hollywood. It's funny, but it's not just funny. Under the humor, there's an edge, a savvy understanding of how the game is played. The people who are throwing him out of their offices one day are his friends a week later. It happens. The movie sends up the Hollywood world of celebrity hairdressing. David Rasche has an amusing supporting role as Stig, a muscular, long-haired Norwegian stylist who is the reigning king in Hollywood. His absurd Norwegian accent is priceless. Frances Fisher is also a pleasure as a high-powered agent whose hair is so overprocessed that it's a chemical away from bursting into flames. .. ",1
" THE CHATEAU: Comedy. Starring Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Sylvie Testud and Didier Flamand. Directed by Jesse Peretz. (R. 92 minutes. In English and in French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie is something of a low-budget miracle, shot in France by writer- director Jesse Peretz using handheld digital cameras and actors who improvised most of their dialogue. Improvisation can be a frightening thing -- and, in one notable scene here, it proves almost disastrous. But for the most part the experiment yields some choice moments. Paul Rudd and Romany Malco play Graham and Allen, a pair of adoptive brothers who make their first trip abroad, to France, when they inherit a chateau from a distant uncle. Graham is white and something of a slacker, well meaning and ineffectual; Allen, who wants to be known as Rex, is black and has an Internet business selling sex aids. The two arrive at night at the chateau after a long train ride and present themselves at the door in broken French. Rudd is a scream, radiating idiot- American good cheer to the servants while trying to muscle his way through a language with just a handful of words. At one point, he does something that Americans often accidentally find themselves doing in France -- speaking English with a French accent. At another point, Rudd is served potato soup and, intending to say in French that he loves potatoes, he instead announces, with beatific self-satisfaction, Je t'aime potate (I love you, potato). The chateau is the collective American dream of a European castle, massive, palatial, ancient, surrounded by a moat and by acres of farm and grazing land. But the place is in debt, and Rex, who fancies himself a businessman, wants to sell, even if it means putting the household staff out on the street. Malco, who started out in the world of rap and whose most important previous role was playing MC Hammer in a cable TV movie, comically and adeptly shows us who Rex thinks he is (a hotshot entrepreneur) and who he really is (someone only slightly smarter than his helpless brother). As Graham, Rudd is the heart of the movie, but The Chateau almost blows it by inserting a scene in which Graham has a drunken tantrum and tells everybody off. The improvised speech comes across as the worst sort of actor indulgence. It almost ruins our sense of the character and damages our pleasure in the movie. It's remarkable that Peretz indulged Rudd enough to film it, much less put it into his finished picture. Fortunately, the movie has plenty of virtues to make to make up for this tiresome lapse. Sylvie Testud, as the French maid, is a study in how to convey complex emotions with a minimum of dialogue. Moreover, the depiction of the way the French see Americans -- as noisy, presumptuous and blithely disrespectful -- feels accurate. For that matter, so does the depiction of French cuisine as seen through vegan American eyes, when in one scene a boar's head is plopped onto the center of a table. Despite the humor and its overall good nature, the uncompromising quality of the film's observations makes The Chateau more substantial than a feel- good romp -- there's something melancholy about it. For this Peretz should be congratulated, though it's worth noting that the picture also fits neatly into the resume of its producers, Robin O'Hara and Scott Macaulay. Their films, What Happened Was--, and The Wife, were also comedies of manners, discomfort and revelation. . This film contains strong language. ",1
" THE EMPEROR'S CLUB: Drama. Starring Kevin Kline, Emile Hirsch and Joel Gretsch. Directed by Michael Hoffman. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This comes as a surprise, because much of the movie seems like a series of cliches about boys' prep schools and dedicated, selfless teachers. Kevin Kline plays Mr. Hundert, a Greek and Roman history teacher who balances his exacting classroom manner with a tendency to tear up on demand -- so we know he really cares. It seems we're in for a classical version of Dead Poets Society, but no. Slowly and carefully, the movie is setting up something else entirely. Much of the picture is told in flashback to the 1970s, a '70s, incidentally, that director Michael Hoffman does not try to re-create in style, dress or even talk (someone utters an anachronistic Duh!). Mr. Hundert's classroom exists outside time, inside a platonic ideal where teachers speak and students open up like flowers. And then one day a snake enters the garden, a U.S. senator's son named Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch). He looks angelic and acts demonic, and completely charms not only his fellow students but also Mr. Hundert, who is somehow seduced into taking on Sedgewick as a special challenge. In Hundert, Kline finds himself trapped in a role with no dark side, no subtext, no capacity to surprise the audience -- and yet that soon becomes all right, once we realize that Hundert's real function is to observe Sedgewick, who brings turmoil but also life into Hundert's arid classroom. The movie benefits enormously from Hirsch's knowing and spontaneous performance as Sedgewick. Hirsch's reactive face clearly registers every shade of emotion. If the kid were merely obnoxious, there'd be no movie, but Hirsch beguiles the audience, just as Sedgewick beguiles his teacher. The action of The Emperor's Club concerns a competition held every year at the prep school. Students take a series of tests in classical history, and then three finalists compete onstage for the exalted title of Mr. Julius Caesar. The irony is never remarked upon but is there for all to notice: A school that prides itself on its moral uprightness names its highest honor after a political leader with the morals of a murderous gangster, a man who spent his entire adult life maneuvering to transform a republic into a dictatorship. That's the true Emperor's Club, not one made up of diligent scholars who play by the rules but of lords of the universe who win any way they can. It's the sad reality that Hundert spends his life ignoring but that the movie is willing to face. The Emperor's Club, so satisfying in its big themes, sometimes rankles in its details. There's a preciousness to some scenes, and it's not just Hundert's preciousness but the movie's. The teacher's great romance, with a colleague (Embeth Davidtz), is presented as so achingly genteel that she seems more like a beard, thrown in so we won't suspect anything unwholesome in Hundert's devotion to his boys. There's also a nagging sense that the movie is in some way a celebration of the privileged world it's supposedly holding to account. Twenty-five years later, the boys have a reunion, with Hundert as their honored guest, and we discover that these guys are now all rich and running the country. Still, it's in the epilogue that The Emperor's Club really pays off, with Joel Gretsch suitably complex and enigmatic as the adult Sedgewick, a performance very much in harmony with the Sedgewick we knew as a young man. . This film contains very mild sexual references. ",1
" THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: Action. Starring Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Directed by Rob Cohen. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 107 minutes.) It's the kind of movie where a guy sneaks up to hit somebody just as the soundtrack blares a song that goes: Watch your back/ Watch your back/ Watcho, watcho, watcho back. Pandemonium ensues. It's a good movie, even though it's exactly the kind of movie that's usually awful: youth-oriented, straining to be contemporary, straining to be mythic, with no faith in an audience's capacity to stay awake without being jolted. But The Fast and the Furious has something special about it. It's a formula movie, to be sure, but it's Formula One. Director Rob Cohen infuses the picture with its own overriding tone -- a kind of surreal authenticity, if such a thing can be imagined. In its non-racing sections the movie is nicely paced, with an eye to keeping the story moving. It's an old story, with new characters. Vin Diesel plays Dominic, the king of the street racers, a natural leader of men, with a shaved head and muscles bulging out of his tank top. Paul Walker is Brian, a fresh-faced fellow from Phoenix with a handful of secrets. The main thing is he wants to race and find respect on the mean streets. As for the racing scenes, they will probably be of interest even to people who drive the speed limit on Interstate 5. The cars are like rockets, spitting fire out the tailpipe. The performances are adequate but so charismatic that it doesn't really matter. Diesel is certainly going places. Though at times the thought crosses the mind, Hold it, can this guy act?, he makes up for it with the look, the poise and the growling bass voice of a real original -- and a future star. . This film contains violence. ",1
" THE GAME: Thriller. Starring Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by David Fincher. (R. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Game, which opens today, does a couple of very satisfying things. It gives the viewer the sadistic thrill of watching the life of a powerful control freak come apart. We see millionaire investment broker Nicholas Van Orton (Douglas) go from rich to poor, from safe to vulnerable, from clean to dirty. He starts in slick suits and ends in rags, starts with a cold stare and ends in tears.  The Game takes us with him on his fall, so that we vicariously feel the rush, the dizzying effect of a steep plummet. Not every movie can have it both ways, but The Game manages it: We want to see the hero get tortured. Yet we share his fear of losing everything. Douglas plays a clenched fist of a man, one who thinks only of business, schedule and work. He lives in San Francisco in the biggest house on Broadway (the exteriors were actually filmed elsewhere) and drives to the Financial District every day, where he engineers hostile takeovers. No wonder his brother -- played by Sean Penn, who actually looks like Douglas, with that cleft chin -- decides to loosen him up with an unconventional 48th birthday present. The game in The Game is a series of challenging life experiences custom-tailored for a select few by a mysterious Montgomery Street outfit. It has the appeal of initiation into a secret society. The businessman goes there at his brother's recommendation and, after a physical and a psychiatric evaluation, goes home, where odd things immediately start happening to him. Newscasters speak directly to him from the TV screen. There's a hidden surveillance camera in his house. He starts receiving mysterious keys. That's just for starters. Since we never know more than the hero, we experience the game through his eyes. At first, it seems like a fun thing, even a life enhancer. At the very least, life is no longer routine. Every moment has possibility. Wherever he goes, the businessman, as well as the audience, is on the lookout for the odd and unexpected. But there's nothing more naive than a smiling protagonist -- or a comfortable audience. As in a Hitchcock film, both viewer and victim soon find themselves scanning the onscreen faces of strangers and never quite feeling safe. The Game was directed by David Fincher and inhabits a visual world similar to that of his previous two features, Seven and Alien 3. It's dark, claustrophobic and unsettling. The colors are muted, and if anything does stand out, it's for a reason: The businessman finds a bloody clown effigy in his driveway, and the brightness of the fake blood adds to the jolt. The Game gets darker and murkier as it goes along, or maybe it just seems that way. Things get ugly quickly, as the businessman begins to suspect that this game isn't all in fun. At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes. The picture provides Douglas with one of his best roles. If he doesn't quite reach the bizarre heights he achieved in Falling Down, in which he played an average Joe who snaps, The Game makes its own demands. This tale is told exclusively from one man's perspective. Douglas is in every scene and never drops his intensity or focus. He gets good support from ACT veteran Peter Donat, who plays his lawyer, and from Carroll Baker, as his housekeeper. Penn appears in only a handful of scenes but makes the most of them. More central to the story is sexy, eerie Deborah Kara Unger (Crash), a mystery woman who is the first to confide that the people who invented the game are playing for keeps. ",1
" THE GINGERBREAD MAN: Thriller. Starring Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davidtz, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall. Directed by Robert Altman. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Kenneth Branagh plays one of those in The Gingerbread Man -- at least he's that way at the start of the movie. This thriller from Robert Altman, from a story by John Grisham, provides an acting feast of a differerent order for Branagh, who most recently starred in his own production of Hamlet. He lets us see this lawyer's facade slowly crumble. The Gingerbread Man is a Grisham movie unlike other Grisham movies. The story doesn't happen to a naif, and there's no grandstanding about the ethics of the legal profession. It's also not immediately identifiable as an Altman movie, although the clues are there: the uncompromising truthfulness of the relationships, the rightness of detail and the obligatory full-frontal shot of an actress with no clothes on. This time it's Embeth Davidtz taking it off for Bob, in a breakthrough role in which she also sheds her ethereal victim image (Schindler's List). She assumes the fire and anger of a Madeleine Stowe as Mallory, a slightly white-trash woman who's being terrorized by her very white-trash father, played by Robert Duvall. Davidtz is one of three thin brunettes with serious bone structure in The Gingerbread Man. The two others are Famke Janssen as the lawyer's estranged wife and a dark-haired Daryl Hannah as the lawyer's secretary. It's never stated, but we are to understand: This is a man with a weakness for women who look a certain way. So no wonder he drives Mallory home one rainy night after a drunken party. At her house they find the door ajar, and now here comes another perfect Altman detail: She goes into the bathroom, and we hear the clunk of a toilet seat going down. Quick, what does that mean? It means a man was in that house! And if we noticed, why doesn't she? And if she did notice, why doesn't she say something? There's great pleasure in watching a movie in which the director has thought out everything beforehand. This is the case here, not just in terms of plot but also in the beautifully composed shots and locations. Filmed in and around Savannah, Ga., the film includes a scene in the woods that takes place under huge, gnarled tree branches that evoke the image of a man being flogged. If anybody gets flogged in this movie, it's the lawyer. At first he does his best to have his new girlfriend's old man committed. But it's hard to keep a crazy man down, especially when he belongs to a cult of like-minded individuals. The cult is one of the film's loonier attractions. It consists entirely of men older than 60 who don't wash or cut their hair. Kind of like Howard Hughes. Robert Downey Jr. has a vivid featured role as a nice-guy/wise-guy detective with a weakness for booze and women. If it weren't for Altman's touches, The Gingerbread Man would be a mediocre thriller. Even with them, it can't be more than a top-notch genre film, but top-notch is top-notch. Branagh, who is in almost every scene, is sure and ready in his emotions, as always. His technique is unbeatable -- his Southern accent flawless -- but it's his emotional generosity, in an age of close-to- the-vest acting, that makes him especially appealing. ",1
" THE HURRICANE: Drama. Starring Denzel Washington and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Norman Jewison. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Give director Norman Jewison credit for two things: 1) He made the movie; 2) He let Washington run away with it. After that, credit goes to Washington. A natural heavyweight, he lost 60 pounds and trained so he could play Rubin Hurricane Carter, a middleweight who was imprisoned for two decades for murders he did not commit. In The Hurricane, which opens today, Washington gives a penetrating portrait of life at its most extreme. He takes the viewer into the mind of a man experiencing confinement and physical deprivation. More profoundly, he shows what it's like to deal every day with the torments of wild rage and impotence, despair and hope. How does a person survive for 20 years under such circumstances? Hurricane is at its best, and most honest, in exploring this question. The answer: There is no one way. At times, Carter survives by cutting himself off from desire and hope. At other times, he needs to connect with people. Nothing works fully, and nothing works for long. The Hurricane is a strong personal story that weakens only when it reaches clumsily for political significance. The title is the tip-off. It doesn't refer only to the man but to the turmoil of the '50s -- and '60s. Carter wasn't just the Hurricane. He was swept up in it. The film takes time to hit its stride. The narrative has little momentum in its first hour, cutting from scenes of Carter's early life to the story of an African American boy living in Toronto in the 1980s, with three Canadian guardians (played by Liev Schreiber, John Hannah and Deborah Kara Unger). The three guardians are, apparently, nice white people, and that's about all we ever know about them. Jewison is under the impression that he can make Carter's story more important by relating it to broader issues of racism. He cuts to archival footage of white cops beating black protesters. He also shows Carter losing a fight thanks to racist fight judges, something that apparently didn't happen. In fact, Carter's story is enough of an indictment of racism to stand on its own, and its uniqueness is in itself justification for the big-screen treatment. While it's busy preaching, Hurricane leaves out important details. Why, for example, did two juries in two trials in New Jersey -- not Mississippi -- believe Carter to be guilty? The movie would suggest that some people are just plain evil, while others are only good, and that's why Carter was sent up. That's not enough. We ought to know something about the case. Fortunately, Washington takes over after the movie's shaky start. It would take paragraphs to describe fully everything going on in his face in the moment when Hurricane is sentenced to life in prison. It's a mix of anger, terror, dignity and fatalism -- all playing out at once. He has another fathomless moment, late in the film, hearing yet another verdict. There's a sense of privilege in seeing such acting. It's like stepping into someone's soul. Early in his sentence, Carter is put into solitary, and in one of the most powerful scenes, he sits in the dark watching two sides of himself battle for control -- an angry side and a self-indulgent one. The moment physicalizes the psychological fragmentation that comes with long periods alone, and shows the psychological challenge: Out of these equally flawed sides, he has to find the balance to maintain his sanity. The Hurricane is about a 20- year battle inside one mind, and about how a man became a hero simply by surviving.  .. ",1
" THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE: Documentary about Robert Evans. Narrated by Robert Evans. Directed by Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Evans narrates the film in his distinctive gravelly voice, never appearing on camera, except in archival footage and still photos. He provides the words, and directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein provide the visuals, and the strategy works. It helps that Evans and the filmmakers have a great tale to tell, but The Kid Stays in the Picture, based on Evans's autobiography of the same name, is more than a gossipy insider's story. It's also a morality tale and a kind of riddle. Just as we're having fun, accepting all the anecdotes at face value, we begin to wonder: Do we really know anything about this man? Is he revealing himself or merely carting out some created fantasy version of himself? And does he even know the difference? Does Robert Evans even know who Robert Evans is? The answer to all those questions is the same -- who knows? -- but the questions make the movie all the more tantalizing. The story of Robert Evans, who produced some of the greatest movies of the '60s and '70s, is one rich enough to be looked at from a number of angles, and with equal satisfaction. It is, first of all, the story of a certain kind of talent, that of a producer. A producer's talent is hard to gauge or quantify, and thus is convenient to ignore. The producer doesn't do anything, and yet he does everything. He gets the movie made. He assembles a team and often imposes his vision. We all know about bad producers, who destroy the work of artists, but what about a good producer? In Evans's 10-year heyday, he produced a string of hits and a fair number of classics: The Odd Couple, Romeo and Juliet, Rosemary's Baby, Love Story, The Conformist, Harold and Maude, the first two Godfather movies, Death Wish, Serpico and Marathon Man. He didn't make, write or direct these movies, but to have presided over such an outpouring, he had to have been gifted in some way. Either that, or he was the luckiest man alive. Actually, he might have been the luckiest man alive. A businessman in his 20s, he was taking calls by a poolside in Hollywood one day when Norma Shearer spotted him and offered to cast him as her late husband, Irving Thalberg, in a biopic about Lon Chaney. Then, less than a year later, Daryl Zanuck spotted him in a New York nightclub and cast him as the bullfighter in The Sun Also Rises. Then 10 years later, while a novice in his 30s, he was asked to head Paramount -- and the hits kept coming. For a time, whenever things could go either way, they went Evans' way. He had so much luck it was scary, because sooner or later, luck like that runs out -- as it did for him, in a big way, in the 1980s. So one could look at The Kid in a mystical context, as a movie about karma or chance, as something about the ebb and flow of fortune. It's also a cautionary tale. By Evans' own account, he worked 18-hour days, investing everything in his work, and when his career fell apart, so did he. Ultimately, he had to check himself into a mental ward to keep from killing himself. Evans' example is an extreme version of the way many Americans live their lives. It's all about career and work, with everyone running around in circles like a hamster, and for what? The filmmakers keep The Kid Stays in the Picture as interesting to look at as it is to listen to, coming up with imaginative ways to visualize Evans' stories. One particularly smart touch: As Evans tells of escaping from the mental hospital, we see little two- and three-second snippets from his films that illustrate and comment on his words. . This film contains strong language and brief nudity. ",1
" THE NET: Suspense. Starring Sandra Bullock. Directed by Irwin Winkler. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's a familiar theme in thrillers, from Hitchcock's North by Northwest and The Wrong Man to The Pelican Brief. But The Net, opening today at Bay Area theaters, has a gimmick: the Internet. It's about how our lives revolve around computers and how it's possible to manipulate information to erase or alter a person's identity. Bullock plays Angela, a hacker who works free-lance finding glitches in software and curing viruses found in computer games. Looking at Bullock -- at her dark hair and fair complexion, at the cleft in her chin, at the benign yet slightly pained expression in her face -- you come to realize: This is who Michael Jackson has been working hard to look like for the past 15 years. Bullock's pained expression here is one of shyness. She plays a woman who is at home in front of a computer screen but uncomfortable around people. Shyness in movies is usually played as an adorable trait, but Bullock, who possibly overdosed on her own adorableness in While You Were Sleeping, is honest enough to play Angela as uncomfortable, not cute. If that doesn't sound like much, just imagine what Julia Roberts would do toothing up the role. At the start, Angela is having a regular day in front of the old screen when a colleague sends her a computer game with a bizarre glitch. When she puts the cursor on a little pi symbol and presses Enter, the screen goes crazy, tossing up pages and pages of confidential government files. From here things start happening. A suave assassin, posing as a wealthy, handsome Mr. Right, invites her onto his boat for a  quiet evening alone. Friends start turning up dead. Angela comes back from a vacation to find that her house has been sold and that her identity has been switched with that of a criminal who has jumped bail. Implicit in The Net is the idea that in this era, anyone could lose her identity in the computer. In fact, something like that could happen only to someone like Angela, who the film takes pains to show has no direct, in-person contact with anybody. The Net is a scary film that could have been terrifying but for something slightly earnest and plodding in director Irwin Winkler's attack. A dreamlike, trapped-in-the-funhouse quality seems to be called for, but aside from a slightly overwrought sequence in which Angela is dodging bullets on a merry- go-round, Winkler gives no sense of a world closing in, just individual nasty people. All the same, The Net is tense and inventive. By the middle, it seems impossible that our heroine can get out of the trap. But Winkler, who co-wrote the screenplay with producer Rob Cowan, finds ingenious ways for her to maneuver -- ways that are exciting and satisfying without being too farfetched. The whole last section of The Net takes place in downtown San Francisco. A climactic chase takes place on Montgomery Street during what was a real-life AIDS demonstration. The chase then moves to the Macworld trade exposition at Moscone Center. The last half-hour is gripping stuff that makes up for some slow going early on. But the screenplay misses one chance. When our heroine is in Moscone Center, trying to get away from assassins long enough to get online and get her story out there, all she had to do was run a block down to The Chronicle. ",1
" THE NEW EVE: Drama. Starring Karin Viard and Pierre-Loup Rajot. Directed by Catherine Corsini. (Not rated. 94 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) It's fascinating. The lady is a mess. She goes to a family dinner and starts mouthing off to her brother and pregnant sister-in-law about how much she hates married couples. Then she goes to a nightclub, drinks herself into a stupor and has sex with a stranger on an elevator. Twice she vomits all over herself. One thing that's so compelling about the film is that filmmaker Catherine Corsini seems to be on this woman's side. Or if she's not, she never tips her hand. So we get this spectacle of horror presented without judgment. Camille has nothing going for her -- not looks, not virtue, not even a personality to call her own, since substance abuse tends to turn everyone into the same mumbling ruin. All Camille has is a hunger, indiscriminate and grotesque. She seizes on a political activist, Alexis, who is happily married with two children, and he becomes her obsession. Pierre-Loup Rajot plays Alexis as reasonable and levelheaded, so it seems unimaginable that he could ever succumb to this chain-smoking, vomiting, whining train wreck of a human being. But then, that's why we go to the movies -- to see the unimaginable. The New Eve could be used as a kind of Rorschach test for relationships. Certainly, some people will see it and think Camille is one cool lady. If one were dating someone who thought that, it would be good to know right away. For that reason, it might be wise to see this film on a first or second date, just for beginning couples to know whom they're dealing with. As Camille, Karin Viard gives a brilliant performance that's as unguarded as they come. She asks for no sympathy or understanding from the audience. In fact, Viard does nothing to show that she, herself, understands that Camille is a horror show. It's only later that one realizes that Viard was acting, and then the depth of her achievement becomes apparent. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity and strong language. ",1
" THE PANIC ROOM: Thriller. Starring Jodie Foster, Kristen Stewart, Forest Whitaker and Dwight Yoakam. Directed by David Fincher. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) We're just getting started. The camera waits, with perverse curiosity (this camera has a personality) as men get out of a car. Then it moves to a door, and -- this is a jolt -- it seems to dive into and out of the keyhole. Obviously, the keyhole trick is some kind of computer effect, but it seems real, and the flow remains unbroken, as the camera backs up and starts whipping through rooms, then goes back upstairs, past the woman's bedroom and all the way to the roof. The camera is recording a scene of breaking and entering, and it's doing it with not only flair but also apparent pleasure. It's enjoying the fact that it knows things the characters don't, just as Fincher seems to be savoring his virtuosity. The rest of The Panic Room might not live up to that one flash of cinematic gorgeousness, but it's still a strong thriller because it never forgets its audience. It might sometimes forget to make sense, but no matter, since it creates enough tension that the audience can hardly think anyway. Jodie Foster stars, and it's a pleasure, for once, to see her in something entertaining and mindless. Unlike most Foster films of the past 10 years, there's no aura of earnestness about this one. The movie comes with no implicit assurance that, if you see it, you will be a better person. Yet the very absence of those qualities makes The Panic Room an excellent showcase for her talents. With no higher purpose to her performance, Foster can only rely on her ability to sustain an emotional connection with her audience. She does it expertly. She plays the newly divorced mother of a young teenage girl, who moves into a massive four-story Manhattan brownstone for reasons that only screenwriter David Koepp could possibly fathom. That's 4,200 square feet between two people. Conveniently, the house is equipped with something called a panic room. In case of a break-in, it's enclosed in steel, impossible to penetrate and has TV monitors showing everything going on in the other rooms. A person could hide in there for a long time. The Panic Room gets Foster and Kristen Stewart, who plays the daughter, into that room in the first 20 minutes. It also gets three desperate crooks on the outside of that room -- Forest Whitaker, as a home-security expert gone bad; Dwight Yoakam, as a maniac in a mask; and Jared Leto, as the idiot who fancies himself leader of the trio. The women hide, and the men try to get in. That's the simple premise that the filmmakers take and, with a fair degree of ingenuity, milk for an additional 88 minutes of excitement. Going into details would only spoil those details. Without its surprises, The Panic Room would have nothing to recommend it -- or at least very little besides a convincing Foster performance. Foster once won an Oscar for acting terrified, and she hasn't lost her touch. What's also welcome is the aura of integrity that Foster lends this desperate woman. In other films, when Foster tries to play integrity, it seems as if she's protesting too much. Here she's not trying, and something innate comes through. . This film contains graphic violence. ",1
" THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT: Drama. Starring Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love and Edward Norton. Directed by Milos Forman. (R. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The good news is that this is a life meant for big-screen treatment. It's a love story, with tragic overtones; a courtroom drama, with political implications; and a tale about overcoming physical hardship. At its best -- in the beginning, before it reveals its intentions -- The People vs. Larry Flynt is a great American success story about a kid who goes from rags to riches through hard work and pluck. Years ago, actors like Jimmy Stewart, Spencer Tracy and Gary Cooper would play such fellows. Poor boys with a vision who beat the odds by maintaining a homespun understanding of popular taste. It's a nice commentary on the amoral heart of this American myth to lift the mantle and find underneath it the happily leering figure of a pornography magnate. The People vs. Larry Flynt is strongest when it recognizes the irony of Flynt embodying the American dream. We like Flynt because he's a success. We root for him because we want to believe in success -- and also because his story is interesting. A strip-joint owner, Flynt starts his magazine, Hustler, merely as a newsletter for his club. But he soon realizes that his product fills a vacuum, that there are hundreds of thousands of men who'll pay to see unflattering photographs of naked, mean-looking women. As portrayed by Woody Harrelson, Flynt is a sincere man. He's not a pipe-smoking, pajama-wearing poseur, intent on inciting envy, nor a cynic driven by greed. He's a true believer, a genuine sleaze, and therefore likable. Harrelson plays him at the beginning like a wild- eyed weirdo with a gift for business, and though the performance turns cartoony, we still buy it. Director Milos Forman presents the early part of Flynt's story against a tawdry 1970s amusement park of electric colors, thumping disco and hot tubs. A hot tub is the location for one of best scenes, in which Flynt proposes to his soul mate, Althea, an erotic dancer played by Courtney Love. It's not the most romantic proposal -- she persuades him by assuring him that they could still sleep with other people. But there's something universal and touching about the moment all the same. There's no doubting that these misfits belong together. With The People vs. Larry Flynt, Love does what Madonna has been trying to do for 12 years -- create a performance filled with humor, intelligence and soul. The picture is a delight for the first hour, as Flynt and Althea build their empire and Flynt relishes the fame that comes with his first obscenity cases. In a cameo, the real Larry Flynt shows up here as a dim-witted judge who sentences Flynt to 20 years in prison. But after Flynt is shot by a would-be assassin and paralyzed, the film becomes less of a romp. It asks us to take Flynt seriously as it focuses in on his various legal battles. Flynt remains colorful -- showing up in court in a safari helmet and claiming that samurai have been feeding him secret information -- and the film is never less than entertaining. But it loses its ironic edge. Freedom lovers of all stripes won't have much trouble getting behind Flynt, but the movie makes it too easy. It pits Flynt against a self-righteous Charles Keating, soon to be embroiled in his own legal battles, and a fatuous Jerry Falwell. Viewers may congratulate themselves for their First Amendment passion, but then most people aren't all that vehemently opposed to pornography. A key line comes when Flynt tells the press that if the First Amendment protects him, it protects everybody, because he's the biggest scumbag of them all. On that one point rests the movie's claim to social importance, yet the point is plainly untrue. There are people much more offensive than Flynt. Make a movie about a neo- Nazi printing lies about the Holocaust -- make us root for that guy -- and you'll have made a movie about the First Amendment. The People vs. Larry Flynt belongs to another tradition altogether. It's a modern-day Capra film, about an unorthodox businessman who's persecuted for his originality but eventually is recognized for the lovable, rugged American individualist he truly is. Forman might not have intended it, but with The People vs. Larry Flynt he has made a Mr. Deeds Goes to Town for the '90s. ",1
" THE PRINCESS DIARIES: Comedy. Starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews. Directed by Garry Marshall. (G. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) And it's more than a little like his big hit Pretty Woman: It's about a young lady, rough around the edges, who takes lessons in decorum to be transformed into a princess. It's like both those Marshall films, and yet it's better, a lot better. Indeed, The Princess Diaries may be Marshall's best movie. Here, the sweetness of spirit that has governed his work -- that made Beaches too corny and Pretty Woman, a prostitution romp, clueless and distasteful -- no longer seems incongruous. Instead, we get something nice: a sweet movie from a sweet director. In making this family film, one never senses that Marshall is slumming. If anything, he has found his calling. The Princess Diaries is entertaining and pleasing for children and parents, and not in the schizophrenic way of most kid's movies, which toss naughty in-jokes over the kiddies' heads. This time, parents and children can watch the same movie and enjoy it for the same reasons. The picture stars newcomer Anne Hathaway, who starts off the film looking hopelessly ungainly. She plays Mia, a gangly, klutzy San Franciscan , who has bad posture and can't do a thing with her hair. She and her best friend, played by the luminous and strangely lovely Heather Matarazzo (Welcome to the Dollhouse), enjoy the comradeship of outcasts. Marshall uses San Francisco locations in the time-honored tradition, with Golden Gate Bridge vistas and shots of people walking up steep hills. It makes for an ideal world in which to place this modern fairy tale, about an average 15-year-old girl who finds out that she is heir to the throne of a small European kingdom. The reigning queen of Genovia is played by Julie Andrews, looking as gracious and lovely as she did at this year's Oscars. The queen knows that if she doesn't persuade her granddaughter to accept the throne, Genovia will be swallowed by a neighboring country. But Mia, at first, isn't interested. It's the only sour note in the film -- the brattiness of Mia, early on, when she can't appreciate her good luck. Most of the comic situations turn on the princess' ungainliness -- her first formal dinner is a slapstick disaster -- but the laughs, surprisingly, don't come from watching Hathaway's clumsiness but Andrews' pained reactions. The queen is Andrews' best showcase in years, making ideal use of the actress' distinctive brittleness and warmth. Hathaway is not a natural comic, but her acting has a truthfulness that gives The Princess Diaries its emotional core. She is also a chameleon, who, from the most unpromising of beginnings, blossoms before our eyes into near- Audrey Hepburn-level loveliness. As the princess grows into her role, she is no longer the awkward girl who made her best friend feel so safe. Hathaway's scenes with Matarazzo have the authentic ring of young adolescence: two scared kids, trying to hold on to their friendship, talking things over. In addition to its other virtues, The Princess Diaries has a real-live pop star in its cast, though it's not one anybody under 25 has probably heard of: Mandy Moore, in the obligatory role of Mia's high school nemesis.

" THE RAGE: CARRIE 2: Horror. Starring Emily Bergl, Jason London and Amy Irving. Directed by Katt Shea. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Rage: Carrie 2, which opens today at Bay Area theaters, does what good horror movies do: It taps into the baser emotions. Anyone who has ever felt intimidated or resentful, anyone who has ever been to high school and felt on the outs, anyone who has ever been angry enough to want to make things explode will not be immune to this movie's appeal. The original Carrie, the 1976 film directed by Brian De Palma and based on a novel by Steven King, ended with Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) wiping out 73 classmates at her high school prom. There was an unfortunate incident involving pig's blood, a fire, explosions, general unpleasantness. Going into The Rage we know that sooner or later -- probably later -- someone is going to make Rachel angry. Way angry. She will be deceived and humiliated and, with the enviable resiliency of the young, she will bounce back by killing everyone she knows. The trick for the filmmakers was to make The Rage worth watching through that long stretch between opening credits and climactic carnage. They succeeded. The picture never flags, and the emotional stakes are high. Two improvements are made on the original film. The heroine is more appealing, and the high school villains are the lowest, vilest specimens ever to play varsity football or wear cheerleaders' uniforms. Unlike Carrie, Rachel is not a freak. She's a self-possessed young lady who has had some hard knocks. Screen newcomer Emily Bergl plays her as unfazed and unimpressed, but with a burning need to connect lying just beneath the surface. Don't think of the plaintive Spacek. Picture the kinds of women Barbara Stanwyck played in the 1930s. Rachel isn't in control of her gift. In fact, she tries to pretend it's all in her head, but her guidance counselor -- Amy Irving, back as Carrie's best friend, 23 years later -- knows a telekinetic wonder when she sees one. Among the nicest of the film's directorial touches is that Irving's scenes are faintly campy. The counselor is a permanently scarred and ineffectual oddball. The whole film is marked by the happy mischief and the sure control of tone that have characterized director Katt Shea's other films. Like Stripped to Kill and Poison Ivy, The Rage aims low and hits -- but with exuberance and a strange sort of geniality. There's something refreshing about a movie that aspires only to entertain and then does just that. The young cast is a blast. Jason London has the obligatory role as the one nice guy, but everyone else gets to be really evil. Dylan Bruno leads a pack of jocks who compete to see who can have sex with the most girls. Leave it to a female director to depict misogyny. The teenage boys are presented as feral and complacent, while the girls in their circle are just as vicious. It's clear that The Rage is working when, long before the finish, the viewer stops rooting for Rachel to control her rage and starts wondering at her restraint. ",1
" THE REAL BLONDE: Comedy. Starring Matthew Modine, Catherine Keener, Maxwell Caulfield and Daryl Hannah. Directed by Tom DiCillo. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture, which opens today, is by far his best film. It has the freedom and wild comic sensibility of Living in Oblivion, but it operates on a much wider canvas, juggling several characters in various walks of life. The Real Blonde also has the undercurrent of serious emotion that DiCillo tried to find in Box of Moonlight, with mixed results. Here DiCillo is in complete control. He casts his frequent leading lady Catherine Keener, a kind of East Village Diane Keaton, as Mary, a high-fashion makeup artist whose relationship with her live-in boyfriend, Joe, has hit a wall. Joe (Matthew Modine) is a 35-year-old actor with no agent and no prospects, who, in his other job for a catering company, has the humiliation of waiting on his more successful friends. At one point, a no-nonsense casting director, played by Kathleen Turner in one of the film's several spot-on cameos, orders Joe out of her office because of his unemployed arrogance (I don't consider soaps to be acting). When he grovels and comes clean, she sees what we see -- that there's an essential goodness and light to this guy. That's what The Real Blonde is about: Decency and humanity somehow rising out of the sea of ego and illusion that rules the worlds of style, fashion and entertainment. The picture takes its title from the quest of Joe's sleazy lothario friend, Bob (Maxwell Caulfield), to find a woman who's blond all over. Daryl Hannah, his co-star in an inane soap opera, is one of several blondes who show up. Also in key roles are Bridgette Wilson, as a New Age fashion model, and Elizabeth Berkley, who plays a stand-in for Madonna. The characters' disparate stories are bound together by their mounting urgency to find the big payoff, whatever that might be. DiCillo presents their journeys in an emotionally truthful way. Joe has to bottom out before he emerges into the fearlessness he needs to release his talent. Meanwhile, Bob eventually tastes humiliation in a way that's much more important for his humanity than his successful career. DiCillo's script is loose, free and funny. There are swift, economical moments of observation. In one shot, he pulls back from a Polaroid picture of Joe on the wall of a casting office to show hundreds of Polaroids of other men in a similar pose. DiCillo shows us the world as we know it to be and then shows people managing to see each other, all the same. The actors bring panache and joy to the film, which, after all, is as much a gift to them as the audience. Marlo Thomas is ideally cast as a tough fashion photographer; Denis Leary shows a more tentative side as the leader of a women's self-defense class, and Buck Henry is a scream as Mary's psychiatrist. DiCillo understands what these actors can do as well as his characters understand each other. After The Real Blonde, there's no question this is a very special director. ",1
" THE ROOKIE: Drama. Starring Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths. Directed by John Lee Hancock. (G. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's the story of Jim Morris, a minor-league pitcher who left the game after injuring his arm in his early 20s. More than 10 years later, at age 35, Morris tried out again -- this time with a miraculous fast ball that got him a major-league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Take that premise, add that this is a G-rated Disney picture, and you might expect something either naive and corny or a little too chirpy, a real-life version of all those baseball fantasies about things like 12-year-old sluggers. Instead, The Rookie is about a guy with a sunburned neck, sitting on his porch drinking jug wine the color of Kool-Aid and wondering what might have been. It's about staring off into a Texas landscape in which the dust and flatness are a reflection of one's prospects. The emotion captured throughout is not something as obvious or ephemeral as sadness but something more lingering and subtle -- a deep malaise. Dennis Quaid, an actor who has been through the emotional wringer in the past couple of years, brings to the role a rug-pulled-out-from-under-him haunted quality that fits. It also helps that Quaid looks about seven or eight years older than the part required. Morris, as played by Quaid and emphasized in John Lee Hancock's direction, is a functioning member of society, a father, a schoolteacher and a baseball coach. Yet he remains, on some level, the walking wounded. How come you didn't make it? his son asks him, in that unwittingly destructive way kids have, and Quaid's face registers it all -- embarrassment, disappointment, restraint. He manages to come up with an honest answer that at the same time invites no further discussion. It's never one thing. Hancock, directing his first movie, avoids the usual Hollywood style of rushing to the climax but rather lets the movie float along at its own pace. Like a European director, he trusts that the story is interesting, and fortunately, he's right. Hancock's style, like baseball, will bore some people to tears, but the thoughtfulness and detail are worth appreciating. For what seems like half the movie, The Rookie deals with Morris' experience as a high school baseball coach, taking time to introduce the kids and fill in their personalities. The movie also invests time in Morris' home life with his wife (Rachel Griffiths of HBO's Six Feet Under) and children and goes into some detail about his relationship with his father, a hard case played by Brian Cox. When Morris finally tries out to play pro ball, he's called to the mound just as he's changing his baby's diaper. The moment is not played cute. We feel the weight of his responsibility. Likewise, when he's signed to the minors, it's no great joy. He's a grown man, missing his family, surrounded by 18-year-old boys. The Rookie eschews cliches and cuts to the truth. And always there's Texas, looking pretty bleak. In one nice shot, Morris stands on the mound, throwing high school batting practice. On one side of the shot is Quaid; on the other there's the catcher, and in the middle there's a fence, a pickup truck and absolutely nothing. Will this man ever be able to throw his way out of here? The Rookie is being billed as an inspirational story, but it's something better than that. Morris doesn't succeed by grit or pluck but by a freakish bit of luck. Things easily could have gone the other way, and the movie, in its honesty, never lets us forget it. ",1
" THE SIXTH SENSE: Psychological thriller. Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If this isn't the single best performance ever by a preadolescent male in a motion picture, then it's tied for whatever is first. Young Osment (he's 11) plays an 8-year-old who sees dead people, and he's not hallucinating. Invisible to everyone else, dead people present themselves to the boy and, without so much as a hello, pour out their frustrations. They died violently. They were murdered. They're angry. The most distressing thing is, as the boy says, they don't know they're dead. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan wrote himself into what easily could have been a hopeless situation. He created a screenplay that depended on finding a child actor as talented as the 50-year-old James Stewart. Shyamalan needed a kid who could convey the outer limits of inner anguish and torment, a kid whose manner suggests that he already knows more about human extremes than a priest, a doctor or a front-lines soldier. Bruce Willis, as a sympathetic child psychiatrist, has more screen time, but his role is reactive. Osment carries the drama. Whether one credits precocity, intuition or a freakish natural gift, the boy gets every drop out of this character. He plays Cole, a boy who is more than scared. He doubts his sanity, feels guilty and insecure, and he's in despair, knowing that no one will believe him. In the first scene, Willis is shot by a now-adult former patient who then kills himself. Once recovered, Crowe sees in Cole a chance to succeed where he failed with the first boy. Willis plays Crowe in a soft-spoken mode. No smirking. His acting is subdued, heartfelt and full of loneliness. Never has psychiatry been presented as such a melancholy calling. Crowe devotes all his resources to making a connection with the boy, and his personal life suffers. He works all day, and when he comes home his wife doesn't talk to him. She is becoming interested in another man. About the only sign that she still cares about Crowe is that she watches their wedding video incessantly. When the dead appear to Cole, they come with great urgency, as though they've finally managed to establish a line of communication and need to talk fast before the line cuts out. This element adds to the frightening aspect of these visions, not just for the boy but for the audience. A dead girl appears before his eyes, vomiting. A dead woman stands in the kitchen, screaming about her husband. When Cole turns his head in school, he sees hanging victims from 100 years earlier, staring at him. The Sixth Sense is scary in two ways. It's scary in its suggestion of a world within our world, one that our minds choose to ignore. Cole tells his psychiatrist that when the hair stands up on your neck, that is the dead trying to connect. There's no doubting Osment when he says these lines. But just as scary, or at least as unsettling, is the film's presentation of human existence as an endless series of tragedies and agonies, relieved only by foolish distraction. Shyamalan (Wide Awake), in his first major feature, builds and sustains an eerie mood made up of equal parts tension and despair. Unlike 90 percent of films, The Sixth Sense gets better as it goes along. Willis and Osment are beautifully supported by Toni Collette as Cole's mother. After years of being known for being heavy, Collette has pulled a Maria Callas and turned svelte. She plays a working-class mom without the usual Hollywood notes of condescension or nobility. She's just a matter-of-fact good mom, and Collette plays her with every nerve frayed, every emotion on the surface of her face.  .. ",1
" THE SON'S ROOM: Drama. Starring Nanni Moretti and Laura Morante. Directed by Nanni Moretti. (R. 99 minutes. In Italian with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) If you still happen to be a blank slate, you might want to stay that way. If so, you're excused from reading the following. Knowing the subject matter of The Son's Room certainly won't ruin it, but it will change one's perception of the big shock that comes about 25 minutes in. The Son's Room will inevitably be described as a movie about a family coping with grief. That's a fair description, but it creates the wrong image. It's a movie about a family. We meet them in the beginning, and, unlike what would be the case in a Hollywood picture, no one is walking around with the word doom on his forehead. The opening drifts along in a pleasant way, building a portrait of a happy family with the usual minor problems. Nanni Moretti, who directed and co-wrote the story, plays the husband and father, an amazingly placid psychiatrist. The shrink's bizarre roster of patients is the only clue that Moretti has previously specialized in comedy. So work is good. Money is good. The teenage kids, a boy and a girl, are fine, and the sex life with the wife (Laura Morante) is going along swimmingly. And then one day, out of nowhere, the son is killed in a traffic accident. This is where the long buildup comes in handy. By the time tragedy strikes, it doesn't seem like something bound to happen. It seems to us as it seems to the people onscreen, as if the story has gone off the tracks, that this makes no sense. The death of the son takes the cohesive unit of the family and explodes it into pieces. Husband, wife and daughter have to find one another all over again. The Son's Room investigates that process, and not in a neat way, because it's not a neat process. It's messy and painful. When bad things happen, there's a tendency to feel as if reality has taken a wrong turn and there's no way back. Moretti uses the movie camera to simulate that feeling within the viewer. The psychiatrist keeps rehashing the events of the fateful day, imagining different ways things might have gone. Moretti's performance is low-key but detailed. He makes the psychiatrist a fascinating guy, rather austere and restrained, a Northern Italian, not an expressive Neapolitan. He's nicely matched by Morante, who as the wife is an emotional powerhouse. . Advisory: This film contains nudity. ",1
" THE TAO OF STEVE: Romantic comedy. Starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman. Directed by Jenniphr Goodman. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture, which opens today, creates the sense of entering a circle of genuine acquaintances, a quality that gives the film a genial humanity that never feels precious or forced. The Tao of Steve is about a different place and a different kind of person, and thus stands out as an unusual movie romance. Co-writer and director Jenniphr Goodman based the fictional film on the adventures of a friend of hers whose success with women she found both inexplicable and fascinating. Donal Logue plays Dex, once a slim campus ladies' man, now a very fat, pot- smoking kindergarten teacher living in Santa Fe, N.M. Dex has something, and it isn't looks. He has a way with women that he calls the Tao of Steve, which combines Eastern philosophy with a careful observation of Steve McQueen's best movies. Dex, for example, makes a point of putting sex out of his mind when he talks to women, and the result is that they end up finding him attractive, even if they can't figure out why. Women want to have sex 15 minutes after us, he tells a friend. So if you hold out for 20, she'll be chasing you for five. The picture begins with a fun scene at Dex's college reunion, in which everyone is either horrified or amused at Dex's weight gain. There he meets Syd (Greer Goodman), who becomes angry when she realizes that he doesn't remember her. Later, when circumstances start throwing Dex and Syd together on a regular basis, the direction of the story becomes clear. With movie romances, there's no mystery about what will happen. The kick is rather in seeing how love makes people grow to the point that they deserve it. Dex is an appealing guy, but he's also something of a slob, and he lacks ambition or drive. Syd is attractive and forthright, but she can use a little loosening up. Their journey on the road toward making sense as a couple is worth watching. As Dex, Logue makes us believe that a fat guy with a bad haircut and a scraggly beard, who smokes, dresses badly and looks sweaty, could be a ladies' man. He has a nice smile and a likable way, but mainly he radiates the confidence of a fellow who used to be good- looking. As Syd, Goodman has the more programmatic role -- these days desirable women are always presented as intelligent wise guys, latter-day Myrna Loy types -- but she fills it adequately. The film has several scenes in which Dex expounds on his romantic philosophy. The Tao part is interesting, but the scene in which he talks about great Steves of pop culture is insipid faux Tarantino, and the movie's worst moment. As Dex talks about various TV heroes, the camera spins around a table, in what seems like a visual reference to the scene in Reservoir Dogs in which the crooks discuss Madonna's Like a Virgin. In the movies, people just love old TV shows. In real life, those old TV shows went off the air for a reason. .. ",1
" THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH: Drama. Starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards. Directed by Michael Apted. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's the movie that proves that Bond can order his martini shaken, not stirred, without people in the audience feeling the impulse to elbow each other. It's just a man ordering a drink. Making a James Bond movie in 1999 requires lots of juggling. The World Is Not Enough, which opens today, does the juggling and finds the right balances. The result is a thoroughly satisfying, completely entertaining film that's also, rather surprisingly, an emotionally full experience. Here's one example of what makes this picture work: Bond movies require Bond girls, so this one gives us Denise Richards as, believe it or not, a nuclear scientist. With her wet T-shirt, smart banter and ridiculous name -- Christmas Jones -- she enters a tradition inhabited by other memorably named yet interchangeable characters such as Pussy Galore and Holly Goodhead. But the movie also gives us a Bond woman who is no girl. As Elektra, an oil magnate targeted for assassination, Sophie Marceau plays a role that a man would have played 30 years ago -- and what a waste that would have been. The charm and mischief of Marceau's performance is a big part of the film's appeal. Another plus is the moment-to-moment honesty of Michael Apted's direction, not to mention Pierce Brosnan, who, in this third installment, must be acknowledged as one of the best Bonds. Back-to-back action sequences start the movie, and each is more inventive than ones found in other action films. In the first, Bond is in a small room surrounded by armed men who are pointing guns at him. No problem. The other is a chase scene done with speedboats. Somehow the chase never seems generic but intrinsically Bond-like. The story is pure nonsense, but it goes by too quickly to notice. More important, the characters act as if they believe the story, with no winking at the audience. Bond is sent to the Middle East to protect Elektra (Marceau), whose life is being threatened by Renard, a terrorist played by Robert Carlyle. Renard has a neurological problem. He was shot in the head and has lost his sense of taste and touch. He is, as a result, like Superman -- or at the very least, like Al Pacino at the end of Scarface -- impervious to both pain and pleasure. In the hands of a less gifted director, Renard could have been a cartoon villain, but Apted (Blink) is too sensitive to go for the cheap effect. Though the circumstances may be cartoon-like, Apted has his actors invest their characters with all their passion. Renard becomes a tragic figure, a man unable to kiss his lover and feel it. Carlyle walks like one of the living dead, exuding a sad dislocation. Apted works the same magic with Marceau's performance. The French actress, who was beautiful but pastel in her previous American films, could have played Elektra as a one-note vixen. But Marceau plays her -- a victim of kidnapping and torture -- as a psychologically complex woman. The World Is Not Enough provides all the usual attractions. Bond goes skiing, which is an occasion for assassins to drop hand grenades on him. There are gadgets, double entendres, stolen warheads and vivid characters. Judi Dench plays M with authority. Robbie Coltrane is a pleasure as a Russian gangster. That a Bond movie should be amusing is expected, but that it should linger in the mind is the surprise here. The World Is Not Enough is one of the few films in the series in which one feels Bond's mental strain. Bond is a killer. He has to live with that, and it's not always easy. Though he may look as smooth as Roger Moore, Brosnan gives us a Bond who is capable but emotionally scarred.  .. ",1
" THREE TO TANGO: Romantic comedy. Starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt. Directed by Damon Santostefano. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Matthew Perry plays a fellow who is assumed to be gay, and for various reasons he can't reveal the truth. The picture takes that farcical situation and works it for every scrap of humor. Perry plays Oscar, a Chicago architect who, with his partner (Oliver Platt), is in the running for a contract worth $90 million. Neve Campbell is Amy, a 30-ish artist who is involved with a married man. Campbell hardly seems 30-ish. She is not convincing as an artist. And the perky personality she adopts rings false. Yet, overall, she is fine in the movie. Some mysteries of cinema cannot be unlocked by criticism, so why pretend? The couple is first thrown together when Oscar's boss has Oscar, whom he believes to be gay, spy on his lover, who turns out to be Amy. The two hit it off. Amy moves in with Oscar, undresses in front of him and invites him into the room when she is taking a bath. In one scene, she tells him, in detail, about her one lesbian experience, while he tries to conceal a painful case of lust. Three to Tango -- the title, incidentally, makes no sense -- has fun compounding Oscar's discomfort. Women confide in him. Men come on to him. Eventually, he has the disconcerting experience of becoming a gay public figure, a straight man in the closet. Perry is at his best playing frenetic confusion, and he exists in that state for most of the film.  .. ",1
" TREKKIES: Documentary. Starring Denise Crosby. Directed by Roger Nygard. (PG. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's about men and women who practice Klingon mating rituals or tell their friends what their Romulon name is. It's about the whole phenomenon of the Star Trek obsession. It doesn't analyze or explain it; it just presents it. The result is funny and disturbing at the same time. It hurts to laugh. It hurts for two reasons: It's painful to watch people embarrass themselves. And it's unsettling to wonder if we, too, are as boring on the subject of our pet obsessions. There is a line between obsession and madness, and there's another line between love and madness. Some of the folks in this movie seem close to crossing both lines. I don't want my officers to ever feel ashamed to wear their uniform, says Barbara Adams of Arkan sas, who was dismissed from a Whitewater jury for dressing like a Star Trek officer. But wait, there's more. There's the dentist from Orlando, Fla., whose office is designed like a starship. And there's the drag queen who specializes in singing science- fiction folk songs -- songs sung on the original series. And there's the fellow who gives classes in the Klingon language. The sad part is not that these folks love Star Trek. Rather, it's the sense of an unrequited need behind it. In another century, such people would have been religious mystics. But in a secular era, they can only be like the obsessive Brent Spiner (Lieutenant Commander Data) fan -- a woman who says that whenever she feels stressed out, she stands on her terrace, faces Spiner's house and thinks of him. The movie, narrated by Denise Crosby, who was on The Next Generation series, vaguely suggests that this mania is a good thing. But in showing us how nonsense over a TV screen can replace real spirituality, the documentary suggests the ultimate futuristic nightmare. ",1
" TWO GIRLS AND A GUY: Comedy. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Film lovers, of course, pretend to want to see small, personal films, but how personal? Two Girls and a Guy doesn't cater to a polite world view or configure itself to a safe set of genteel indie-film assumptions. It confronts the audience with a raunchy vision of sex and relationships. In the course of revealing his characters, writer-director James Toback (Fingers) reveals more of what's swirling around his own head than he probably intended. Toback is here. He's straight. Get used to it. The picture, which opens today, is clearly told from a male perspective. Toback tries to be fair. He gives us in Blake (played by Robert Downey Jr.) a lying scoundrel, but he's a lovable lying scoundrel, a true sparkling energy. His two girlfriends, Carla (Heather Graham) and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner), are, conversely, strong and forthright. All that means is that they're angry, sexy and use the f-word a lot. They look real cute when they're mad. The women meet outside Blake's Manhattan loft and realize that they're dating the same man. They break into his apartment, and soon he comes home from a business trip. From that premise, on that one set, Toback strings out a consistently entertaining picture, occurring mostly in real time. The tone is comic, harsh and exaggerated -- an invitation for Downey to pull out all the stops. He sings opera and acts a scene from Hamlet, talks to himself in the mirror and lies, sputters and lies again. The greatest love onscreen here is not that between Blake and his women; it's Toback's for Downey. He loves him so much he lets him go too far, so that some moments play as set-pieces. Yet it becomes fascinating once one catches on: Downey is a stand-in for Toback himself, perhaps not in a factual way, but certainly in an emotional sense. Two Girls and a Guy may pretend to be a candid look at sex and fidelity in the '90s. In fact, it's a celebration of the scoundrel within and a plea for women to find, in men's darkest and most selfish traits, something adorable. Object to the picture on ideological grounds, if you like, but that's no way to watch movies. Better to appreciate the rare spectacle of a filmmaker leading from his gut. There are personal moments all over this film -- for example, Toback's loving close-ups of Wagner. In the end, they're far more affecting than the oral sex encounter between Downey and Graham, the sequence that almost gave the film an NC-17 rating. Downey is undeniably magnetic, though at times one gets the feeling he's playing the role as a kind of posthumous tribute to himself. It's eerie. Graham is capable but sullen, while Wagner is the one who really shines, all snapping black eyes and tomboy earnestness. The daughter of Natalie Wood, Wagner doesn't wink at the audience to let it know she's not as ignorant and naive as the character she plays. It's a performance that risks being misunderstood, and it probably will be. ",1
" TWO WEEKS NOTICE: Romantic comedy. Starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. Directed by Marc Lawrence. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) They make a jolly couple, for one thing. And there are other virtues. In Two Weeks Notice, Grant may play a real estate tycoon, but Bullock's a Harvard lawyer, so it's not like she's going through life waiting to stuff her foot into a glass slipper. The two meet the way couples tend to meet, on the job, and before anything happens they get to know each other. When they discover their mutual attraction, it's more than a matter of a woman realizing she needs money and a man realizing he could use a girlfriend. Two Weeks Notice gives us people, not socioeconomic types. These people make for pleasant company. Grant, of course, is Grant, and Bullock is Bullock, with a few new shadings just to assure us they're not playing this in their sleep. As Wade, the real estate magnate, Grant speaks in charming quips, flawlessly timed, but he's a bit of a mess, too -- too flip, too lazy, too undemanding of himself. He's someone who can go either way. He could end up an unrealized man inside an empty suit. Or he can challenge himself and become a dynamic force for good. As Lucy, the crusading lawyer, Bullock is again the intelligent tomboy who keeps stumbling into embarrassment -- making jokes that don't work, laughing inappropriately. In Two Weeks Notice, she's also a do-gooder and a control freak, who sees the slovenly soul under Wade's slick facade. She likes him, but after a year of working for him, she can't take it anymore and gives her . . . two weeks notice. Most of the movie takes place over the course of those two weeks, as Lucy looks to hire her own replacement. Alicia Witt plays a young lawyer up for Lucy's job, and any young person who wants to see what makes middle-aged people cringe in a corporate setting should make a study of Witt here: The fawning, the calculation and the blind ambition are as transparent as plastic wrap. The script, which was written by the film's director, Marc Lawrence, has holes in logic and some weak scenes. Two Weeks Notice is very much a movie that rides on its co-stars, but it rides nicely. Even when it's hard to believe the movie, it's easy to believe them -- and appreciate a romance, for once, about two grown-ups who act like it. . This film contains sexual situations. ",1
" The Bourne Ultimatum: Action. Starring Matt Damon, David Straitharn, Julia Stiles and Joan Allen. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and show times, and to buy tickets to select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) If United 93 showed the tragedy, The Bourne Ultimatum shows an America living with the aftermath. The events of 9/11 aren't mentioned, but they don't need to be, as their aftershocks are all too apparent. This is a movie about fear - a government's fear of its citizens and citizens' fear of their government. It's a movie about surveillance, with people being watched at virtually every moment. Finally, it's about philosophies in collision, about how much safety can be bought at the price of freedom and about the kinds of personalities that gravitate toward the totalitarian mind-set. It's about all these things, even as it seems to be nothing more than a pretext for Matt Damon to spend two hours onscreen getting shot at. This is not to suggest that The Bourne Ultimatum is a serious statement disguised as a straight-up action thriller. Rather it's to say that, somewhere in the making of this straight-up action thriller, somebody wasn't afraid to let an idea or two slip in. Greengrass - who also directed The Bourne Supremacy, the second film in the trilogy - and screenwriters Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi set their picture in the world that we all know, one in which people are doing some of the very things that Americans today are worrying about. In the process, the filmmakers capture some of the anxious spirit of the times. Jason Bourne is anxious, too. It's three movies in, and he's still not a happy person. He wants to know who he is and why he has more passports than most guys have socks, and most of all he wants to find out how he became the strange being that he is - plagued by conscience, yet emotionally detached, a government-trained killing machine. When a London journalist indicates in a column that he knows something about the Bourne case, Bourne goes to see him - and so do officials operating out of a special unit inside the CIA. It's a paranoid's worst nightmare: David Straitharn, as Vosen, the head of the special unit, intends to do everything he can to make sure the secrets surrounding Bourne are never revealed, and he has at his command armies of agents, satellite technology and seeming access to every cell phone, computer and surveillance camera on the face of the earth. An early action sequence in Waterloo Station, in which Bourne tries to choreograph the moves of the journalist so that they both avoid government assassins, is brilliantly executed. But beyond the appeal of the action, there's a mythic aspect of The Bourne Ultimatum that's worth savoring, one that I suspect Iron John author Robert Bly would appreciate. Bourne is a young man who has been betrayed by old men - men he trusted, like a good son. Thus, the film presents a kind of metaphorical story of a son who was lied to and abandoned by fathers who are now trying to hide from the consequences. In any era, that metaphor has powerful unconscious resonances, but its reverberations become downright transcendental at those times when older men are betraying younger men's idealism by sending them into wars they cannot win. Albert Finney plays the psychiatrist who developed the program that turned Bourne into an assassin, and he submits to some brutal close-ups. Bourne is searching for his father, and all there is to find is this morally depraved old man, with a face full of bloat and burst blood vessels. Greengrass shoots Finney's face in a bright, uncompromising light that shows every pore and blemish, and the idea becomes implicit: Bourne sacrificed everything - for that. On the downside, Greengrass shakes the camera too much, and he sometimes shoots action in a way that makes it hard to know what's going on. Greengrass got away with his crazy camera in United 93 for two reasons: First, the confined space made it impossible to lose the audience. And second, an intensely subjective camera was appropriate there because everyone who had ever contemplated flight 93 had imagined himself or herself on that plane - so he was only showing us what we'd already seen in our minds. He should have taken it a bit more easy in The Bourne Ultimatum, but all the same, he has made a thoughtful, superior action movie. -- Advisory: This film contains violence, stressful scenes and disturbing images.

" The Girl From Paris: Drama. Starring Mathilde Seigner and Michel Serrault. Directed by Christian Carion. (Not rated. 103 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The saving grace of this French film is that it's anything but a sentimental story. Rather, it's very much grounded in the specifics of its world -- the world of farming -- and of the personalities of its two principals, Sandrine (Mathilde Seigner), a young Parisienne who fulfills a dream to buy a working farm, and Adrien (Michel Serrault), the tired, taciturn old man who sells it to her. Both characters have edges and bear watching, and there's nothing cliched about the presentation of their growth and interaction. A nice touch is that Adrien is a hard man, not a lovably hard man, not gruff, not brusque, not Henry Fonda in On Golden Pond, but exhausted, cold and unyielding. At one point, he loses his temper with some nearby farmers, and behind his unexpected anger, we can see, in Serrault's performance, a lifetime of hard work and bitterness -- a bitterness, we discover, not without cause. When he sells the farm to Sandrine, it's on the condition that he can live on the property for six months, but he doesn't bother with her. Still, he notices with interest how she generates money by bringing in tourists and by selling cheese on the Internet. As played by Seigner, Sandrine is a city girl whose sturdy body seems designed by nature for country life. When she's milking cows, she's in her element. When she's in her old life, teaching computer classes, she seems unrealized. At the same time, the movie is hardly romantic about farming. The work is endless, and to the extent Sandrine raises livestock, the farm is something of a death factory. The Girl From Paris follows these two individuals as they come to understand and redefine themselves. They meet at a point when each is coming to a different place in life, and getting there isn't easy. The drama here is hardly earthshaking, but the movie has a quiet power, and the vivid emotions linger in the memory.-- ",1
" The In-Laws: Comedy. Starring Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks. Directed by Andrew Fleming. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie stars Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, not the most likely of co-stars, but that's the idea. Douglas plays a blithe CIA agent, an unflappable rogue who conceals his wicked machinations beneath a smiling exterior and a hail-fellow-well-met manner. It's a pleasure to see Douglas in a rare movie where he doesn't have to grit his teeth in tension, just as it's always a pleasure to watch Brooks get mentally tortured. He's a podiatrist whose ordered life goes haywire when he meets Steve (Douglas), the father of his future son-in-law. The stress of weddings and the strain of meeting in-laws lend themselves to comic exaggeration, but The In-Laws, like its predecessor, adds into the mix a zany element of international intrigue. Throughout the movie, Steve is trying to do two things -- fulfill the responsibilities surrounding his son's wedding and prevent a nuclear submarine from getting into the hands of a megalomaniacal French arms dealer. Much of the comedy derives from the way Steve reacts to both challenges as though they were equally difficult. Most people who will see The In-Laws will not have seen the original, so there is no point in dwelling long on specific comparisons, except to note that the difference between Peter Falk and Michael Douglas in the role of the CIA agent changes the tenor of the movie. Falk played him as a reasonable- sounding madman, while Douglas plays him as a smooth James Bond type. Fans of the original may at first resist that difference, but they should be won over once they realize that this In-Laws, unlike the original, doesn't lose steam in its second act but gets better as it goes along. Brooks, with his patented misery, dread and disdain, plays Jerry, a man who doesn't like to take chances. He won't get on airplanes, and he won't drink water from the tap unless it's been running at least 20 seconds. With a sixth sense for danger, he takes an immediate dislike to Steve, who soon gets him embroiled in an arms-smuggling scheme. Steve drugs him, and Jerry wakes up on a private plane (belonging to Barbra Streisand) heading to France. Nat Mauldin and Ed Solomon's screenplay comes fully into its own once it departs from the original story line. The plot moves to northern France for a knockout sequence in which Brooks is forced to impersonate an international criminal called Fat Cobra. As the villain Thibodoux, David Suchet is extremely funny, expressing a Roy Cohn-like contempt for homosexuality even as he finds himself madly attracted to Fat Cobra. The scene in which the two men walk arm in arm and another in which they soak together in a hot tub are hilarious. Other jokes may be hit too hard or milked too long, but Andrew Fleming directs the film with enough energy that there's little time to dwell on imperfection. Events and bits and little moments tumble forward in good- natured abundance. K.C. and the Sunshine Band turn up to sing Get Down Tonight at a rehearsal dinner, looking good 25 years past their '70s heyday. Candice Bergen has a featured role as Steve's ex-wife, exuding false composure and severe inner turbulence as a woman who, despite years in psychotherapy and an ashram, has not gotten over the strain of living with a wild man. The appeal of buddy movies has something to do with seeing differences harmonized. By coincidence, a French film opening this week, Man on the Train,  offers the same pleasurable spectacle, though in a different style. The key to success seems to be in making the differences deep and wide, and Douglas and Brooks have that innately. The other key seems to be in bridging those differences convincingly. There, The In-Laws relies on comic formula -- but does so with more than usual panache. . This film contains sexual situations and mild violence. ",1
" The Medallion: Action comedy. Starring Jackie Chan, Claire Forlani and Lee Evans. Directed by Gordon Chan. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Of course, it's not quite as easy as that, not in the details -- Chan's physical stunts alone are intricate feats of choreography and execution. Yet in the broad outlines, anyone making a Chan movie really just has to remember two things: 1) Jackie Chan is an astounding physical entity, as beautiful to watch as Fred Astaire, Charlie Chaplin or a ballet dancer; and 2) Chan is an equally enchanting spiritual entity, as funny and benign as Chaplin, Buster Keaton or a basket of kittens. The makers of The Medallion remember these points and find ways to highlight them, and so their movie is a delight. Otherwise, it's a fairly humble showcase, yet another film with Julian Sands as a villain, walking around in the same sort of floor-length hyena fur, prince-of-darkness coat he was wearing in Warlock a decade ago. But that doesn't matter. The movie understands Chan. We first meet him at an outdoor seafood stand in Hong Kong, about to chow down, when a stray dog looks up at him, hungry. He can't eat in front of a hungry animal -- that's just the kind of lovable softy he is -- so he gives the dog his plate and orders another for himself. Taking place in Hong Kong and England, The Medallion tells the story of a criminal mastermind's efforts to steal a medallion that can give its bearer immortality, as well as extraordinary speed, strength and agility. With his suggestion of Aryan evil and his finishing school manners, Snakehead (Sands) is a colorful villain, who lives in an Irish castle, newly renovated in a modernist style. Obviously, he wants to live forever so he can continue to do bad decorating -- he's the Ian Schrager of ruined castles. Chan is Eddie, a Hong Kong detective reassigned to Interpol to work on the medallion case. His associates are a former girlfriend, Nicole (Claire Forlani), and Watson (Lee Evans), a klutzy but brave British agent. Something in the exaggerated slapstick and goofiness of the Watson character is the first tip-off of a non-Western sensibility at work -- it's just not Western- style comedy. Turns out, although The Medallion is an American studio film, it's very much a Hong Kong product, directed by Gordon Chan and produced, conceived and co-written by veterans of the Hong Kong film industry. It makes a difference. Surrounded by his longtime colleagues, Chan exudes the cheer of someone once again on his home turf, as well as the relief of someone finally not having to contain his radiant natural energy. He's always had the unassuming ease and utter confidence of mastery, and here he has a whole movie to demonstrate it. Unlike the Shanghai Knights series, in which he's paired with Owen Wilson, or the Rush Hour movies, in which he's paired with Chris Tucker, Chan doesn't have to worry about blowing some inferior American co-star off the screen. He climbs, he swings, he chases -- but no, there's no real way to describe a Chan action sequence. At one point, he is running after someone, and the person kicks a row of bicycles, intending to scatter them and slow Chan down. Chan leaps up, lands with one foot on a bicycle seat -- and by landing and moving forward, he prevents the row from toppling. That's just five seconds out of a five-minute sequence packed with gems like that. The action is exceptionally well filmed, pulling back when we need to see Chan's whole body, moving in when we do not, using long takes when we need to know that it's really Chan doing those things, and gracefully panning within shots to precisely the right spot. Forlani, an excellent and underused actress, makes a lovely romantic partner for Chan, not just beautiful but also intelligent. From the way she looks at him, we know that she doesn't just see a boyfriend but everything unique and wonderful about him. That is, she sees what we see.-- Advisory: This film contains action-movie violence. ",1
" The Quiet American: Drama. Starring Michael Caine, Brendan Fraser and Do Thi Hai Yen. Directed by Phillip Noyce. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie itself is a more mixed affair. There are ambitious ideas, about the ambiguity of morals and the ease with which decent people can be corrupted. But, in fact, right and wrong still look pretty obvious here, and the characters seem eminently corruptible. Phillip Noyce directs the film with the gravity and sprawl of an epic, and the setting and the subject deserve that. But the story comes up thin and in the end seems more like an anecdote. Still, this is a smart and literate effort that despite some weaknesses in overall conception has one undeniable virtue: There's not a single weak scene. The pace may seem dreamy, and the plot may seem elliptical, but that's a clever illusion. In fact, Noyce and screenwriters Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkhan are constantly pushing the story forward, point by point, moment by moment. There are two distinct visual worlds in The Quiet American, a Saigon depicted in fuzzy burnt amber tones and the hyperreal blue and green battlefields of the North. As the film begins, Fowler (Caine) is a Saigon creature, an older European with a young Vietnamese mistress, who spends part of each day in a cafe and does amazingly little work in his job as a London Times correspondent. In his jaded but amiable way, Fowler becomes intrigued by Pyle (Brendan Fraser), an American physician who has come to Vietnam to save its people from a curable but dangerous eye disease. Pyle, in turn, becomes intrigued by Fowler's mistress, Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). Because he's young and single, while Fowler is old and married, Pyle becomes convinced that he has more to offer her. The love triangle is played for a bit more than it's worth in terms of its larger implications about Vietnam, Europe and America. Part of the problem may be the casting of Fraser. The role seems to call for a dangerously idealistic fellow whose can-do spirit and good intentions are ultimately a menace, but Fraser's presence suggests an awareness of darker motives and impulses. He's the 21st century quiet American, not the quiet American, circa 1950. At the center of the triangle, Do Thi Hai Yen wisely doesn't play Phuong as an abstraction. Working with very little dialogue -- most of which is merely mild or obsequious -- she yet manages to lend Phuong a watchful, subtle insolence. She has no power; her fate is not her own, but she's smarter than both these guys, and she knows it. Noyce's low-key approach has its drawbacks. When Fowler says that losing Phuong would be, to him, the beginning of death, it comes as a surprise. Conversely, anyone who wants to see a demonstration of the virtues of subtlety need only watch the remarkable scene in which Fowler sits in the cafe, watching the street, in the seconds leading up to an act of terrorist sabotage. Somehow Noyce lets us know that something is amiss, but how? We know it even before Fowler becomes uneasy. Then -- out of nowhere -- disaster: Explosions rock the fuzzy amber square, and Saigon suddenly has the blue-death look of the North. The war has moved south. This is a sequence to play over and over in film classes. Ultimately, the war becomes a force that can't be denied, the big evil fact that all the characters must accommodate. They're presented with choices that leave them damned if they do and damned if they don't -- or at least that's what the movie would have us believe. Yet for all its elegance, The Quiet American isn't convincing on that one crucial moral point. The right choices remain clear cut, and the man who ultimately chooses wrong is no victim of circumstance, but the victim of his own smallness. This film contains sexual situations and graphic violence. ",1
" The Real Cancun: Reality movie. Directed by Rick De Oliveira. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Real Cancun is definitely in the second category. From the people who brought you MTV's The Real World, the picture takes 16 college-age strangers, throws them into a big apartment in Cancun, Mexico, on spring break, and watches as they talk, get drunk and, in a few cases, pair off sexually. It's a movie guaranteed to get dismissive reviews, and, in a way, it deserves it. Yet there's a case to be made for The Real Cancun as a document of the mating dance as well as an unintentionally poignant film about the brevity of youth. Forget the girls in bathing suits -- The Real Cancun is not a sexy picture, except, maybe, to 20-year-olds. But it is a movie about sex, and it's curious to see how the younger generation is going about it these days. In one scene, there's a wet T-shirt contest. Two twins get up and start shaking it up completely topless, dancing and simulating sex with each other. Yet later in the film, one of the twins announces emphatically, I have never had casual sex, and I never will. Huh? To my eyes, she, in effect, had casual sex with 200 people when she was dancing onstage, but that's an old way of thinking. If The Real Cancun is any indication, the younger generation is a lot more coarse than the generation that proceeded it, and yet the kids' blatancy - - the casualness about nudity, the constant sex talk -- doesn't necessarily translate into increased activity. The Real Cancun was filmed in a month and is being released in theaters a month and two days after shooting wrapped in Mexico. This gives the movie immediacy, but it also makes one cringe for the kids, who have had no time to distance themselves from their youthful folly. Take Alan, who starts off the movie a teetotaler and ends up a goofy drunk. I'd hate to be Alan watching myself on a beach in Cancun running away from a girl who wants to go swimming with him at midnight. No doubt he's kicking himself now, but what Alan doesn't know is that he'll still be kicking himself in 20 years. Youth is always squandered -- part of enjoying youth is squandering it -- and yet there's something sad in seeing people misunderstanding themselves and taking wrong roads. Take Jeremy, the handsome stud, a likable kid but too much in love with himself to connect emotionally. We see him strutting in the sun, this young bronze god, but what we feel for him isn't envy but pity. And then there's Laura, a waitress from a tiny town in Wisconsin, who starts the week thinking she's a hard-partying, wild-woman temptress and within three days is chewed up and spit out by Jeremy. It's a fault of this quickly edited film that Laura's story is all but dropped midway, although it was an emotional journey that demanded completion. The Real Cancun can be seen as a training film for young teenagers (assuming some get in to see this R-rated movie), as an amusing soap opera for college-age people and as anthropology for people who are older. In that sense, it has something for everybody, though it probably does help to be a lot older than 20 to appreciate the wistfulness of the goodbyes at the end. One week in Cancun: It's like a metaphor for youth itself, something appreciated as it happens and yet destined to be cherished more in memory than in the moment. This film contains scenes of sex, nudity and harsh language. ",1
" The Rundown: Action. Starring the Rock, Seann William Scott, Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson. Directed by Peter Berg. (PG-13 minutes. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is an obvious mistake on the part of the athlete -- a 220-pound mistake -- but that such a mistake could be depicted and believed says something affirming about the Rock's prospects for long-term stardom. Would anybody throw a drink in Arnold's face? In Stallone's face? In Steven Seagal's face? No, those guys played supermen. The Rock is something else. He's Superman and Clark Kent rolled into one, and that combination gives him lots of room for drama, comedy and showing a human side. So this is a very good film for the Rock, who proves he's just as much a star in street clothes as he was in a loincloth (The Scorpion King). And it's a very good one for director Peter Berg, who demonstrated with his debut film, Very Bad Things, a certain joyful, twisted screen personality that's all over The Rundown. The action sequences are novel, the performances are slightly askew, and the camera work is vigorous and mostly effective. Here's an example of something unexpected that Berg does with the camera that suggests the movie's flavor: He shows three people in a little boat in the Brazilian rain forest. Then he films them overhead and pulls back the camera. He keeps pulling back until they're just a dot in the distance, and then farther back, until the boat can't be seen by the naked eye. Then, still in the same shot, he zooms in on a truck riding down a jungle road. Now, Berg isn't a great director, or else he'd have had a reason for the shot. But he's not a lousy director, either, or he never would have thought of the shot. What he is is a director who knows how to keep it fun. One could say he has a talent for trash, except that sounds condescending, and nobody who makes a movie as entertaining as The Rundown deserves condescension. Berg establishes a tone that's arch without being self-mocking and stays a step ahead of his audience the whole way. The Rock plays Beck, a nice muscular guy who is interested in cooking and dreams of opening a restaurant. He decides to take one last job from the old crook he works for -- he has to go to the rain forest in Brazil, find the crook's son, Travis (Seann William Scott), and bring him back to Los Angeles. When Beck gets there, he finds a heart-of-darkness nightmare with natives living in hellish slavery, working in gold mines owned by a man named Hatcher, played by Christopher Walken at his most Walken-like. Walken has become such a national institution that the temptation to write specifically for his voice must be overwhelming. There's a scene in which he has to explain to his henchmen why he resents Beck's coming to town to retrieve Travis. It's like you're waiting for the tooth fairy . . . The script, by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt, has him getting bogged down in an extended tooth fairy analogy, made further complicated by its having to be translated into Portuguese for his workers. It's funny writing, but what puts it over is Walken's reliably dead-eyed, deadpan delivery. Beck intrudes into Travis' life, just as Travis -- played by Scott as a bug- eyed young wise guy -- is about to retrieve an ancient relic worth millions. Hatcher wants it, and so does Mariana (Rosario Dawson), and so the film becomes a scramble for the treasure and a scramble for Beck and Travis to escape the jungle, with Hatcher in pursuit. Sometimes Berg overdoes it. There's a scene in a cave, done almost entirely in quick close-ups, that leaves the audience with no sense of place. But most of Berg's flourishes are amusing, including his strategy of intercutting the climactic shootout with the nonsensical ravings of a Scottish madman (Ewen Bremner) who observes the action from a porch. Somebody has been stealing moves from Oliver Stone. - This movie contains violence and some crude dialogue. ",1
" The Shape of Things: Comedy-drama. Starring Rachel Weisz, Paul Rudd, Gretchen Mol and Frederick Weller. Directed by Neil LaBute. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Even more than In the Company of Men, it's the most playlike of his films, with long scenes that have formal beginnings and endings and take place in a single location. Indeed, The Shape of Things started life as a stage play, and it's refreshing to encounter something this literate in a movie theater. The film is certainly clever enough to hold an audience's interest throughout, though in the end it's a victim of its own ambition. As a moral investigation, it's shallow and ultimately ludicrous. That LaBute used the same cast for the film that he used for his London and New York productions is a mark of his integrity. Set in California college town, the picture stars Paul Rudd as Adam, an overweight, badly dressed and extremely diffident fellow who meets a beautiful art student, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), in a museum. He's a part-time security guard, and she has a can of spray paint. She wants to paint genitals onto a plaster fig leaf that was put over the private parts of a God statue centuries ago. OK, let's figure this out. He's Adam. She's Eve(lyn). In Genesis, Adam and Eve started wearing fig leaves after eating from the Tree of Knowledge. Here, she doesn't like fig leaves. Why not? Because she thinks a fig leaf is a form of lying. OK, so, let's see. Evelyn has Eve's after-the-fall knowledge and Eve's pre-fall predilections. What does it all mean? It probably means this is LaBute's movie, and he has a right to have fun. Evelyn decides she likes Adam, a mystery to anyone watching, since, unlike in the Garden of Eden, this woman has more than one guy to choose from. They start seeing each other, and as their relationship progresses, she sets about improving his looks. She makes him dress better. She has him lose weight and get contact lenses. And the physical alterations don't end there. The dialogue in The Shape of Things has LaBute's signature style. It's artificial and exaggerated -- not in the Mamet-like way of being an amplification of real life but in a way that's remote from life, that's a world unto itself. To my eyes, LaBute's vision is reductive and false at its core, relying on the same stock types from film to film. For example, Rudd's manner at the start of The Shape of Things is almost identical to that of Ben Stiller in Your Friends and Neighbors: The diffident, ducklike walk, the excessive smiling and the grotesque tendency to speak in a funny voice whenever he's about to say something slightly daring. Still, LaBute is an amusing writer, and as The Shape of Things is the least portentous of his scripts, it's the most successful. Adam takes Evelyn to meet his friends, Jenny (Gretchen Mol) and Philip (Frederick Weller), and the first social encounter ends in disaster, with Philip and Evelyn getting into an argument about the nature of art, while Jenny, who just wants to get along, and Adam, the embodiment of male cowardice, sit mutely and watch. Philip is another stock LaBute type, the cocky alpha male, sadistic and close- minded. Weller plays him with a nice cartoonlike brio that's right on the edge of satire. This four-hander, as they call it in the theater, plays out in a series of mostly two-person scenes, over the course of a semester, most of them involving Adam, the central character. Weisz is enigmatic, either a wise woman or a power-mad Svengali. Mol is both sweet and interesting, not the easiest combination. It's Rudd's character that experiences the greatest transformation, but in the end it's not nearly great enough -- either physically or spiritually -- to support the points LaBute wants to make. LaBute intends that The Shape of Things should ultimately be a commentary on the ways in which the world's obsession with appearances has a pernicious effect on human character. The movie is really about LaBute's own delight in trickery -- his characters' and his own. . This film contains strong language and sexual situations. ",1
" The X-Files:I Want to Believe: Drama. Starring David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Amanda Peet and Billy Connolly. Directed by Chris Carter. (PG-13. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) So you're getting this from someone who doesn't know The X-Files, never wanted to know it and didn't even see the first X-Files movie. As such, there will be no pronouncements here as to how fans of the old TV series will receive this screen version.  One thing can be said here with certainty: Knowing nothing, zero, nulla, nada and bubkes about X-Files is no impediment to enjoying X-Files: I Want to Believe - and appreciating it for the well-acted, adult piece of work that it is.  It's difficult to take familiar characters, who have been developed and established over countless hours of series television, and put them over within minutes for an audience who doesn't know them. But director Chris Carter and actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson make it look easy. Instead of being anxious to inform the audience of the characters' rich histories, they let the histories come through unburdened by needless detail. The emotional details are there. They're present in the character interaction and even in the lived-in interaction between the actors and their roles.  For example, and this may seem like a small thing, it's rare to see someone play a physician and be as thoroughly believable as Anderson's Dana Scully. It's part of the texture of the film that, no matter what Scully is doing outside the hospital, some of the physician's aura - of living on the frontlines of suffering and illness, of having an unshakeable, ever-present awareness of human frailty - is brought to bear in Anderson's performance. Anderson looks at people as if she knows more than she wants to know, as if she knows how they might end up. And that's precisely how she looks at Duchovny as Mulder, her former investigative partner. On the outs with his former employer, the FBI, he has spent the past six years ... actually, it's hard to say what he's been doing, besides throwing pencils at the ceiling and clipping articles from the newspaper. But then an FBI agent (Amanda Peet, always nice to see her) reunites Mulder and Scully and brings Mulder in to consult on a case: An FBI agent has gone missing. The two former partners go to the old FBI building and stand outside an office looking at pictures of George W. Bush and J. Edgar Hoover in the hallway. Then they exchange blank glances as if to say, Do we really belong here? In their old capacity, Mulder and Scully were part of a special unit that dealt with anything from telepathy to alien abductions. This time, the case is fairly earthbound. There's a pedophiliac former priest (Billy Connolly) who claims to have visions that might help the authorities find the missing agent. Mulder, an expert on the paranormal, is needed to help determine whether the priest is for real. It also helps that he's an eccentric, too, a particularly sensitive one, and knows how to talk to such people.  Carter and co-screenwriter Fred Spotnitz have devised a compelling suspense thriller with some tense moments, and Carter has infused the film with an atmosphere of, not gloom, but sorrowful reflection. The movie is concise, though at times too concise: In one or two scenes, the dialogue is so spare and anemic that the actors have trouble putting over what the moment demands. Still, Carter's restraint is admirable, and so is his willingness to embrace ambiguity and complexity in what could have been just another summer action movie. Of course, in the end it's all about these very full and rewarding lead characters. Youthful but decidedly middle-aged, they've seen more than their share of darkness, and they've reacted the way men and women, respectively, tend to react. She by internalizing it, absorbing it and understanding it. He by denying it, resisting it and then plunging into contact with it. In this way, Mulder and Scully are like functioning models of the male and female principles.  The beauty of their interplay is that each recognizes the value of the other's approach and understands that, every so often, the other is going to be right.  -- Advisory: Violence, gore and frightening situations.",1
" The celebrity interview, especially the personal profile, is a difficult and borderline obscene undertaking on both sides. One person tries to devour the other person’s life. The other offers up choice bits to be devoured. Each tries to seduce the other, and a false atmosphere of camaraderie develops, but neither really believes it. And both will often feel degraded by the experience — the writer for being less important than the celebrity, and the celebrity for being at the mercy of someone who is not a friend.This complicated, peculiar dynamic is at the heart of “The End of the Tour,” a fact-based account of an interview that Rolling Stone writer David Lipsky did with David Foster Wallace in 1996, back when Wallace’s book “Infinite Jest” was the biggest story in publishing. Here a potentially fraught dynamic is further complicated in that both men are writers and roughly the same age. Wallace has everything Lipsky wants, and so Wallace, being no stranger to ambition, tries to deflate the likelihood of envy by emphasizing the strains and insecurities associated with sudden success.The movie, written by playwright Donald Margulies and based on David Lipsky’s book about the interview, is for the most part a two-person film, in which one guy probes and the other talks. Both men, we realize, are trying to do something difficult, which is to get at the truth. Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) is determined not to be charmed or snowed by Wallace, whom he finds very easy to like. At one point, he says that Wallace has a “false social strategy,” in which he pretends to be a normal guy, as though no one in the surrounding area were capable of bearing the full brunt of his brilliance.Wallace (Jason Segel) counters this by saying that it’s true that he is determined to stay a regular person, but this is for the sake of his own emotional survival and integrity, not a way of scoring points. In such moments, Margulies and director James Ponsoldt invite you to imagine what it would be like if you were being interviewed. Try saying something deeply and purely true about yourself. Now hold it up to the light. Does it still seem true? We know ourselves too little and too well, such that the opposite might be true of anything we might say.Because most people don’t do interviews, the impulse of most viewers will be to sympathize with Wallace and think less of Lipsky, who, as played by Eisenberg, is almost feral in pursuit of his story. But from a journalist’s point of view, he’s just someone doing a good job under complicated emotional circumstances. Himself a published novelist, he can’t help but be jealous of Wallace, but at the same time, he loves “Infinite Jest.” Envy has not distorted his judgment. Wallace’s 2008 suicide informs the film and Jason Segel’s performance. What Wallace wants to say, tries to say but can’t quite say is that, having reached the summit of success, he sees an even bigger mountain in front of him. His anxiety about holding it together in the face of newfound celebrity is no affectation. He’s frightened of it and probably has good reason to be.",1
" The immigrant experience is an ongoing 400-year story in America, but in France it’s new enough to keep popping up as a subject for contemporary films. Most of these films and the dilemmas they present would be of minor interest to Americans, but “Samba” is in a whole other category. It was a big hit in France last year, and it should play just as well for American audiences. It’s the follow-up film for directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, who scored one of the biggest hits in European history with “Intouchables,” about an effervescent (or grating) personal assistant who brings joy (or irritation) to a wealthy paraplegic man. The success of that film was mystifying — who knew so many French people wanted to see a movie about an unbearable extrovert annoying a guy in a wheelchair? But “Samba” is a much better film and makes a strong case for Omar Sy, who played the assistant in “Intouchables.” He has calmed down for this film and holds the screen with the thoughtfulness and assurance of a true movie star.Immigrant Samba (Sy), who lives in the country illegally, has been working in a restaurant kitchen in Paris for 10 years, supporting himself while sending money back home to his family in Senegal. Something happens that brings him to the attention of the authorities, and the rest of the movie is about his legal struggle to remain in France. He is aided by some fairly powerless social workers, among them Charlotte Gainsbourg as a businesswoman doing community work after a nervous breakdown.  The movie is full of interesting details about what it’s like to be undocumented in France. For example, the police might issue an order for someone to leave France and may go so far as to drop the person off at the airport. But it’s done with the understanding that the person will remain in the country and try to stay invisible. But staying invisible is very difficult. It means avoiding public places while trying to get a job that pays cash and leaves no paper trail.Sy is terrific in this. As Samba, he just seems like a really good guy — honest, hardworking, ethical and also emotionally strong. He’s someone you would want in your country. Over the course of the film, Samba strikes up a friendship with the temporary social worker played by Gainsbourg, who is, as usual, by turns dreamy and distracted, and focused and disgruntled.Gainsbourg is always going through a little more than she cares to tell the audience about, but the connection her character makes with Samba — real, complicated and not typical — is one of the movie’s highlights. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic. E-mail: mlasalle.com Twitter: Samba Drama. Starring Omar Sy and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano.

" The latest from director Olivier Assayas (“Summer Hours”) is a study in life transition that seems, for most of its running time, just a strangely arresting look into the private world of a European actress. Assayas throws us into the middle of it from the first shot: “Clouds of Sils Maria” begins on a train, vibrating steadily as the actress’ American assistant (Kristen Stewart) juggles calls from various people in her boss’ complicated business and personal life.A few moments later, we meet the star herself, Maria (Juliette Binoche), who is somewhat spoiled and histrionic, but who is also warm and funny and very much an artist. Though a French film, “Clouds of Sils Maria” is mostly in English. It was nominated for six Cesar Awards (the French equivalent of the Oscar), and Stewart won best supporting actress — the first American ever to win in that category. The lucrative artistic detour that was “Twilight” is now behind her, and Stewart is resuming her position as one of our most ambitious and idiosyncratic young actresses. Stewart’s relaxation in front of the camera is something to marvel at. She is always present in the moment and seems unable to fake a scene. She is just there, listening and reacting with her full being, but with nothing strenuous in the act. And the contrast with Binoche, who is twice Stewart’s age and wired at a higher frequency, is simply fun to watch. It’s not a combination most of us would’ve thought of, but Stewart and Binoche bring out the best in each other.Binoche plays an international star whose career was launched 20 years earlier, when she acted in a play about a 20-year-old woman who becomes the romantic obsession of a 40-year-old woman. The first time around, Maria played the young woman. Now there’s a hot new stage director who wants her to play the older woman, and though every instinct tells her not to do it, she agrees. For much of the film, Maria prepares to take on the role, while staying with her assistant in a country house in Sils Maria, Switzerland. Having played the triumphant younger woman, the prospect of playing the abject, groveling older woman distresses her and makes her hard to be around. Gradually, it becomes clear that Assayas is using the casting as a metaphor for the transition between youth and age, one difficult not just for an actress, but for anyone.Here’s what’s strange. Binoche is 51 and looks about 50, albeit a great 50, but Maria is supposed to be 40. This seems a wrong note, especially as the crisis that Maria is experiencing is not the crisis of a 40-year-old but of someone 10 years older. At 40, people still feel like they’re young, even if they grouse about getting older. But at 50, something kicks in, a psychological recognition that one is on the clock. That’s what “Clouds of Sils Maria” is about, a woman coming to terms with the universal clock. The young assistant can’t understand it, but Assayas certainly can, so that he made Maria 40 instead of 50 may simply be a consolation to a great star’s vanity — a playing out of the movie’s themes from outside the movie, as well as within.In any case, Assayas has gracefully pulled off a difficult film, a rather long one made up of lots of conversation, that unfolds with the ease and seeming structurelessness of real life. Yet all the while, he’s telling his story, until gradually we realize what the story is and what it has been all along. And then, not a second before he should, he ends it.",1
" The opening credits are flashed against a billowing red background. It's a rich red, aesthetically pleasing, and then the camera pulls back, and we see that we've been looking all this time at a Nazi flag. The flag is one of several hanging from a government building overlooking a Berlin square, on a beautiful spring day, late in the war. Children are playing, and adults are going about their business. Only the sight of swastikas transforms what would be a benign, inviting sight into something much more complicated and alarming. It's a dislocating experience of cinematic time travel: Moments into The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, we are confronted with the eerie sense of actually being there, on that street, on a nice day during an evil era. The movie instantly puts the audience into the mind space of faceless, typical (non-Jewish) Germans from that time, people just wanting to get on with life and escape the notice of history. But we know they can't escape. We know what's coming. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas could be called a Holocaust movie, but it's one told from a different angle than any other Holocaust film I've seen. At its center is an attractive German family, consisting of a military officer (David Thewlis), his wife (Vera Farmiga) and their two children, a teenage girl and a little boy (Asa Butterfield). Early in the film, we see them at a party celebrating the officer's new promotion. He's a grand success, but the new position means having to relocate the family deep into the countryside. Concentrating on the point of view of the 8-year-old boy, Bruno, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas has the structure and aura of a fable, but it aims for no fablelike distance in its emotions. Right from the beginning, the movie has a surprising ability to evoke strong feelings. There's a real sadness, for example, when Bruno, playing with his friends, has to say goodbye to them and leave with his parents for their new home. It's a painful thing, the powerlessness of childhood.  Bruno has no kids to play with in his new neighborhood. But out one of the back windows, he sees something that looks like fun. It's a farm! With lots of people in striped pajamas all working together! But, no, it's not really a farm at all. It's something so terrible that his parents block the views from that side of the house. It's a concentration camp.  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas tells its simple story with directness, concision and insightful detail. A family finds itself living with blackest evil, and yet this evil manifests in a strangely insidious and quotidian way: the officer's promotion; the wife's household help, consisting of Jewish prisoners; a teenage girl's crush, taking the form of a handsome young Nazi butcher. The little boy watches and takes it all in.  The boy hears from his tutor that Jews aren't really people, but Bruno, without realizing it or even thinking about it, doesn't believe him. In that sense, he's a special kid, a person not really susceptible to self-deceit, someone who, in germinal form, has a heightened perception that allows him to trust what he sees over what he's told. That's a gift, and young Asa Butterfield makes you believe he has it. The boy is his mother's son. She can't lie to herself, either, at least not forever, and her journey, as expressed in Farmiga's performance, is the most memorable thing to take from the film. A devoted wife and mother, proud of her husband's success, she turns around one day and sees a moral malignancy in her family so advanced that it's all but guaranteed to devour everything in her life worth having. Farmiga's emotional clarity and intensity have an almost cleansing quality - so pristine, plain and right. This role takes her abilities and her career to a new level.  -- Advisory: This film contains very disturbing images and implied violence.The Boy in the Striped Pajamas: Drama.

" The world of investment banking and the intrigue that surrounds an initial public offering have provided fodder for a number of recent movies. But “Equity” is the first to be directed by a woman, to be written by women and to place three actresses in the principal roles. So “Equity,” in this case, has a double meaning. At its center is Anna Gunn, as an investment banker who was once the hottest talent on Wall Street but whose luster is wearing thin. She is getting a reputation for being difficult to work with, and the movie doesn’t have to say or even imply what we immediately understand, that were she a man she would not be considered difficult at all, but open and direct. Someone who tells it like it is.  Naomi (Gunn) loves money, the sense of protection it provides and the status it brings. Feeling in need of a career boost, she pursues an Internet security company in the hope of being assigned to guide its IPO. In the meantime, she has three people in her life that require careful watching: an old school friend who is also a federal investigator (Alysia Reiner). Her personal assistant (Sarah Megan Thomas), who is a little too good to be true. And a charming, suave new lover (James Purefoy), who seems as reliable as a busted clock. Gunn brings an interesting awareness to the role. She plays a woman in her mid-40s, trying to survive in a business in which everyone, except the big bosses, is in their 20s or 30s. She conveys a quality of dislocation and unease, like someone trying to learn the latest dance. At the same time, she brings an undercurrent of impatience with it all, so that it’s easy to believe that she’d rub everybody the wrong way.  For those unfamiliar with high finance, “Equity” provides a chance to see how things are done. For example, I always thought that an initial public offering was a simple matter, like pressing a button or putting up a “for sale” sign. In fact, the process is complicated, with a banker like Naomi and a team of underlings working to contact investors, gain commitments and set an opening price. The movie shows that there are possibilities for gaming the system at virtually every stage. The federal regulations supposedly guarding against corruption are hard to enforce, and crimes are hard to prove. Yet these regulations are so pervasive that they are a presence hanging over what might otherwise be normal social contacts. There are things Naomi can’t tell a friend and can’t tell a boyfriend. As such, “Equity” becomes a portrait of a way of life, which, at least from the outside, seems cold and unattractive. Gunn is very good at suggesting the burdens of this life, while Reiner, as the federal agent, exudes the sheer joy (mixed with moral outrage) of being an investigator. Reiner co-wrote the story and gave herself a good part, as did Sarah Megan Thomas, who also co-wrote the story along with Amy Fox and who plays Naomi’s assistant. Normally, Reiner and Thomas might not have been cast together — they look somewhat alike — but the movie benefits from their deep understanding of the roles. In the end, what makes “Equity” an intelligent and honest movie keeps it from being a total crowd-pleaser. It doesn’t go for flashy drama, and the ending is more whimper than bang. But there’s the sense here of something authentic, and unless you’re already in the business, you’ll probably learn something.  Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic.

" Thirteen: Drama. Starring Evan Rachel Wood, Holly Hunter and Nikki Reed. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Thirteen, about a seventh-grade Los Angeles girl whose hunger for popularity leads her into depravity, is an effective and memorable film that's disturbing in several distinct ways. Written by 13-year-old Nikki Reed, in collaboration with writer-director Catherine Hardwicke, the movie speaks to the difficulty of raising a child in an era of media bombardment. Movies, television and music together constitute a kind of glamorous third parent, encouraging self-indulgence and quick thrills and eschewing anything smacking of discipline or caution. That's chilling enough, but what makes the world of Thirteen even more unsettling is the sense one gets that the most gifted students -- the most intelligent, ambitious and socially confident -- are the most susceptible to this siren song of glamour. Evan Rachel Wood plays Tracy, who takes stock of her assets and decides she has the potential for social success. It's the only thing in her world to want. Tracy's less adventurous friends need not apply. Tracy has the stuff. After having her clothes insulted by Evie, the reigning junior high social queen played by none other than the co-author, Reed, Tracy transforms her wardrobe. In school one day, she approaches Evie, and Hardwicke provides us with a series of quick cuts as Evie clocks Tracy's appearance: Her shoes, her pants, her bracelet, her accessories. It's a sad moment. Tracy passes the test, but it's a meaningless test. Thus begins Tracy's transformation from innocence into misery. To impress Evie, she snatches a purse, and from that point on, it's as if she's in the grip of an illness. Evie is no Svengali figure. Both girls have the same bug and are part of the same mass psychosis, like the Hitler Youth. Tracy is the more aware of the two. Through smoking, drinking, drugs and sexual flirtation, it's as if she's grasping for something, some elusive notion of uber-cool, which, in her unquestioning mind, represents the ultimate transcendence. That Tracy wants what she wants with such ferocity makes one inevitably suspect that she has something special inside her. But her behavior toward her mother is so appalling that it's impossible to admire her. Holly Hunter plays the mother, a beautician who runs a business out of the home. A well-meaning mess -- a recovering alcoholic with a drug-taking boyfriend -- she seems precisely the sort of first wife that an up-and-coming executive might jettison on his climb to economic glory. In a sense, the father's rejection of the mother, which takes place before the story begins, is the key to Tracy's own desperate pursuit of success as she understands it. In the dynamic of her family, Mom, however kind and giving, is a loser, while Dad, remote and uncaring, is a winner. The mother, wonderfully flummoxed and flailing in Hunter's performance, can't begin to get through to her daughter, because, in an emotional sense, Tracy has already followed Dad's example. She has tossed Mom overboard. Thirteen follows an episodic structure, constructed as a series of incidents with little connection to each other. But the movie creates the illusion of a linear plot by arranging the incidents so that each successive one is more appalling than the one that went before. Wood is superb at delineating Tracy's slide into desperate incoherence, but equally impressive is Reed, who has to conceal her writer's intelligence in playing a character who's entirely instinctive and unreflective. Thirteen is Reed's triumph, and yet our awareness of her triumph obviates her triumph, in that it undercuts our perception of the film as a cautionary tale. It's ultimately the most disturbing thing about this highly unsettling film: Had Reed stayed a sweet kid, she could never have reached this pinnacle of glamour, as the co-writer and co-star of an acclaimed feature film. Girls who see Thirteen won't fail to grasp that irony. Advisory: This film contains multiple sexual situations, drug use, nudity and strong language. ",1
" This might not have been Zola's intention, but it's difficult to see In Secret - based on his 1867 novel Therese Raquin - except as the horror story of a powerful woman's being trapped in a society in which women are powerless. Thus, every bit of intelligence and strength she possesses, every passionate impulse and every capacity for joy and ecstasy become, not the building blocks of a self-created, satisfying existence, but the means by which she drives herself into a ditch. There are some minor concessions to the era in Elizabeth Olsen's performance as Therese, most notably the English accent that Hollywood seems to think necessary for all portrayals of pre-20th century French people. But Olsen's jumpy intelligence, her unabashed longing and her unquestioning assumption that sexual fulfillment is her birthright are all very modern - and form a bridge between us and this material. Therese is like us, and because she is, we feel she deserves better. Her life must have looked pretty awful back in 1867 and looks at least as bad from here. From childhood, she is brought up by her aunt and sleeps in the same bed with her sickly male cousin, Camille (Tom Felton), who never stops coughing and never, ever washes his hair. Still, this is tolerable, until the aunt announces that Therese and Camille are to be married. It's not as though Therese has a choice: She can starve, become a prostitute or marry a man who wheezes while having sex. Rhythmic wheezing - pretty horrifying. It's a measure of fine storytelling that the audience starts wanting Camille to die long before anybody gets the idea to kill him. Likewise, the film's fullness of perspective is evidenced by the strangely sympathetic way in which we're made to witness and experience Camille's relationship with his doting mother. As played by Jessica Lange, mom looks enchanted by every word he utters, and he preens and glows under her approval. Though their mutual admiration seems like a case of colossal misperception on both sides, what a human thing it is - a woman who loves one thing in the world, and a young man who feels confident and complete only in his mother's eyes. Then things become complicated: Twenty minutes into the film, Oscar Isaac strolls in, as Camille's dashing friend and co-worker, Laurent; and when Laurent and Therese see each other, the inevitable becomes, well, inevitable. Taking a chance, when they're briefly alone, Laurent tells Therese, Unbutton your blouse. Her reply suggests she's already a few steps ahead of him. We don't have time, she answers. Olsen makes good use of her delicate looks by playing against them, and so some of the best moments of In Secret come when the mask of propriety drops and Therese, dead-eyed and fierce, reveals what lurks beneath. This hunger for life drives the action, but also pits Therese against her era, making her a criminal before she contemplates a crime. This is a rich formula that you sometimes see in gangster movies, someone who is too big for a small world.  Casting Lange as the provincial aunt is ideal, in that a generation ago Lange would have played Therese. We recognize some of the same force and impulse within her, but as poured into the socially acceptable channels of meddling, petty tyranny and son worship. Here is a culture in which female strength, having no outlet, must become distorted or lethal. In Therese and her aunt, we find two manifestations of the same disease. Drama. Starring Elizabeth Olsen, Oscar Isaac, Tom Felton and Jessica Lange. Directed by Charlie Stratton. (R. 101 minutes.)",1
" Thriller. Starring Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. (R. 99 minutes.) In a way, the new Carrie is almost too easy to enjoy. Everything discordant and all the nagging weirdness and strange feelings surrounding the original have been smoothed down, and what we're left with is a well-made, highly satisfying and not particularly deep high school revenge movie. Perhaps the difference between this Carrie and the 1976 version can best be summarized as the difference between Chloe Grace Moretz and Sissy Spacek. Moretz is a teenager playing a teenager, a pretty girl who just needs to get away from her crazy mother, and she'll probably be fine. By contrast, Spacek's Carrie was a social freak, damaged almost beyond the reach of therapy, and she was played by a 26-year-old actress, which made her seem even more weird.  There was a feeling in the original of something unanswered, something that could not be explained or redressed by any human action, and the result is that audiences in 1976 walked out with the creeps. No one will get the creeps from the new Carrie. Instead people will walk to their cars saying, That was fun, and not give it another thought - not that that's such a bad thing. The tone is set early, to the sound of a woman's groaning and a jittery camera's making its way slowly into a house and, finally, into a room, where a woman writhes on bloody sheets, in pain. She is praying. She is screaming. She thinks she has some awful disease and that she's about to die, but instead she gives birth - to a daughter: Carrie, meet Mom; Mom, meet Carrie. Needless to say, Mom is played by Julianne Moore, because if you're going to have a scary mommy in a movie, why not the best? The opening, in which complete sexual ignorance causes horror and distress, is paralleled in a scene taking place years later, when Carrie (Moretz), showering in the high school locker room, notices that she is bleeding and panics. She soon finds out that this is her first period, but not before being pelted with tampons by her scornful classmates and having her humiliation caught on a cell-phone camera.  Oh, yes, whatever they could do to Carrie in 1976, the Internet has made even worse. Director Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don't Cry) brings nuance to the mother, who is monstrous but no longer a monster in this telling. Peirce makes use of Moore's force, her capacity for irrationality and her eerie ability to scare an audience just by raising one eyebrow. At the same time, Moore suggests a history - one never told, just hinted at - of serious damage in her own past. By the way, the mother's variety of Catholicism is her own invention. Intercourse was the first sin! she raves, a supposedly biblical quote that she makes up. She also has a nutty idea, which she repeats with great intensity, that men can smell the blood on Carrie and that now they'll be circling her like lust-ridden sharks. Almost 40 years later, Carrie is still irresistible as a formula. It takes something that everyone knows - that high school can be socially difficult - and links that to something wonderfully flashy, a seemingly defenseless girl whose emerging telekinetic power is directly connected to emotional agitation. You could be a saint watching this and still look forward to what's going to happen when she gets really mad. Judy Greer is a warm presence as a sympathetic, though limited, gym teacher, and Portia Doubleday does not hold back as Carrie's nemesis, Chris. Her attack is direct, with no moral shadings to spoil the pleasure. Chris is just evil.",1
" Thriller. Starring Fabrice Luchini, Roschdy Zem and Louise Bourgoin. Directed by Anne Fontaine. In French with English subtitles. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) No matter how old, successful or powerful you are - and no matter how much in command of your life you may be - love and sex can still make a complete idiot out of you, under the right (or wrong) circumstances. This truth plays out often enough in public life, and it's the subject of The Girl From Monaco, an odd and slightly comic thriller from France from director Anne Fontaine.  Fontaine, over the past decade and a half, has been steadily putting together a body of work, as a writer and director, that explores the dark and dangerous side of desire. Dry Cleaning (1997) is probably her best-known film in these parts, but there have been others, including Into His Hands (2005), a terrific thriller about a proper married woman who finds herself falling in love with a serial killer. That such a story could be psychologically rich, and not sensationalist or absurd, is testimony to Fontaine's particular and peculiar vision. In The Girl From Monaco that vision meets up nicely with Fabrice Luchini, the fussy and mercurial comic actor, who here plays a top defense lawyer who comes to Monaco on a case. Because it's a high-profile murder trial, the defendant's family hires a bodyguard to stay with him at all times. And so, right away, we have a nice pairing of opposites: Luchini, who is quick, loquacious, cerebral, and Roschdy Zem as the bodyguard - watchful, terse, elemental. Some movies create an inviting world for the viewer. This is one of them. Monaco, as presented here, is a mix of opulent splendor and small-town coziness, with a lively nightlife. And then there's the title character - the girl from Monaco, Audrey, played by Louise Bourgoin with a beauty and energy that are somehow both unsettling.  The lawyer first sees Audrey on a news show, doing the weather report for a local TV station. (Europe is full of fantastically beautiful young women, who may or may not know anything about meteorology, doing weather reports.) Later, when he happens to meet her, she immediately takes a tremendous interest in this man twice her age. She's friendly, flirty, engaging, inviting - and he's, by turns, alarmed and delighted. She is either the best or worst possible thing that could happen to a middle-aged guy. Or both.  The Girl From Monaco is a great showcase for Luchini, one of the most distinct, idiosyncratic and just-plain-likable actors working today. He is innately comical, and yet so formidable, both in personality and intellect, that he is very much a dramatic actor, as well - not to mention, one in possession of a wonderful gift: Luchini's reactions, second by second, moment by moment, are readable in his eyes, even when he's still. Much of the fun of this film is in watching Luchini try to get a read on his loyal but impassive bodyguard, and in watching his knowing descent into abject helplessness when confronted by a sexy young woman's attentions.  It's a measure of Fontaine's intelligence as a director - and, dare we say it, to the advantages of a having a female director - that Audrey remains distinct, unsettling and never easy to quite pin down. Audrey is Bourgoin's first screen role, and yet, either through Fontaine's guidance or her own sense of proportion, she never tries to charm or assure us. She keeps something in reserve and at times she even dares to be repellent. It's an audacious debut, in a notable, worthwhile picture.-- Advisory:This film contains sexual situations and strong language.",1
" Thriller. Starring Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger and January Jones. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With Harrison Ford mellowing with the years, Liam Neeson is stepping into the position, near and dear to action fans, of the average, over-civilized American man who, finding himself surrounded by trouble, picks up a tire iron and learns to swing it. It's one thing to convince an audience you're tough when you're covered with muscles. But to do so while wearing a jacket and tie takes concentration and sincerity. Neeson brings his own special quality to this type of role. As we saw in Taken, in which he had to rescue his daughter in Paris, and now in Unknown, playing a scholar whose identity gets stolen in Berlin, Neeson has a way of getting upset - a frantic purposefulness - that fills viewers with both empathy and anticipation: He's so miserable that we care. But he's also so morally outraged that we know he's going to do something about it that's big and worth watching. Plus, though he looks like the nicest guy in the world, if you get him mad enough, the gentle expression goes away and he begins to look like a driven maniac.  Unknown was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, from Spain, who has a demonstrated talent for the thriller genre (Orphan, House of Wax). With the solid foundation of a good script, by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell, Collet-Serra gives us a film that does all the things that a quality action must do. It throws our hero into an arresting and baffling situation. It develops that situation through incidents of escalating danger and innovation. And it consistently maintains its ability to surprise. We begin with a nice American couple - Neeson and January Jones - in Berlin for a biotech convention. They pull up at their luxury hotel. As she checks in, he realizes they left a piece of luggage at the airport, and he hops into a taxi to go back. But then an unforeseen accident takes him out of action for four days, and when he finally rushes back to the hotel, his wife insists she doesn't recognize him. She points to another man (Aidan Quinn) and says that he, not Neeson, is Dr. Martin Harris. So there we are. The real Dr. Harris (Neeson) finds himself out on the street in a foreign city, with no passport and with less than a hundred euros in his pocket. What's more, he is becoming paranoid. He looks at vans and wonders if he's being followed. He turns to hear the source of footsteps. He thinks he might be going crazy ... but Liam Neeson is never crazy. German actress Diane Kruger plays a Bosnian refugee in Berlin whose life becomes entangled with the good doctor's. Kruger has become a crisp and unsentimental actress in recent years, quite direct in her appeal. The film also features two superbly crafted supporting roles for older actors: Bruno Ganz, a Swiss actor who is one of the staples of European cinema, shows up as an old Stasi agent who knows the world and knows people, and most of what he knows isn't good. And Frank Langella, who takes on the look of an aging professor, is a trusted colleague of Dr. Harris', working in the same field.  The script finds a perfect action-movie wisecrack for Neeson, something that almost deserves to become a catchphrase. I'd quote it, but it might suggest too much of the resolution to shrewd readers good at inferring that sort of thing. But look for it right around the climax. -- Advisory: This film contains violence.",1
" Thriller. Starring Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore. Directed by Fernando Meirelles. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Blindness, people suddenly and randomly go blind. No warning, just boom - they can't see anything. Planes and buses crash, traffic stalls and people are left in the street pleading, Will somebody help me? And because the sighted assume this is a contagious epidemic, the blind are soon quarantined, put under armed guard and left to fend for themselves. The film, based on the novel by the Portuguese Nobel laureate José Saramago, is not easy to watch. At times, it's almost unbearably ugly - an almost unrelenting vision of squalor, cruelty and human inadequacy. But by the time you walk out of the theater, you know you've seen something. You know it because the street looks different and the people on it less trustworthy.  Saramago's novel was written in the mid-1990s, but nobody made it into a movie until now, for reasons that are pretty obvious. More than at any time since at least the late '60s, the Western world lives today with a pervasive terror of civic catastrophe, the sense that either terrorism or some financial calamity (or a combination) might make all our institutions and codes of behavior collapse. Blindness speaks to that fear, teases it and exploits it, as well as granting a dark desire: to get the apocalypse over with, just to see what's on the other side. By no means is the movie a complete success. In places, it drags. Too many scenes strike the same note, and, at times, Blindness seems like a premise in search of a story, and an allegory in search of a meaning. But in its methodical and uncompromising way, it gets where it needs to go. It starts with one fellow, who is driving in city traffic and is struck blind at a red light. He complains, not of darkness, but of white light. He goes to an ophthalmologist (Mark Ruffalo), and, the next day, the ophthalmologist is struck blind. So are thousands of other people, and when that happens, all hell breaks loose. A few years ago, the authorities were the good guys in movies. Now the man with the badge and the gun, the one who sternly and with mock patience says, Come with me, sir, the one who doesn't want to hear anything, doesn't want to know anything, the one who just wants to obey orders - he's not the hero anymore. In Blindness, that's the thug, multiplied by thousands. But there are anti-authority thugs here, too. They're among the quarantined, and so life inside soon breaks down into a trash-strewn, excrement-streaked, institutionalized version of The Lord of the Flies. Needless to say, don't see this movie to feel good about the fundamental decency of human beings. Blindness is for more exotic tastes, for people who like being forced to go places they'd never go to on their own. Director Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardener) gets under the viewers' skin by making us always aware of our own seeing. He cuts to the bright-light perspective of the characters, or he shoots in near darkness. He also, with great effectiveness, gives us the world as seen through the eyes of the ophthalmologist's wife. She has accompanied her husband into the quarantine and is the one person there who can see. Why is she immune when the others aren't? To answer that for sure, one would have to be certain of the nature and larger meaning of the affliction. It could be dumb luck, or it could be a question of character. In an early scene, someone speculates that either panic caused the blindness or blindness caused the panic. The rest is left to the audience. The one curious thing to note is that, before the epidemic, the wife, as played by Julianne Moore, seems an innocuous person, almost boring, like someone her handsome doctor husband might leave someday. It's an ongoing source of fascination in Blindness, an arresting internal thread to accompany the external story, to see true character gradually reveal itself. Surface personality goes away, and we're left with the real deal - which is the one thing people like about disasters, after all. -- Advisory: Dogs tearing the flesh off of corpses, rape, murder, chaos, misery and people being unpleasant with each other.",1
" To step back and actually look at what Priceless is about is to realize that it tells a pretty tasteless story about tainted characters who do some ugly, degrading things. That the movie doesn't feel that way, not one bit - that it instead feels light and bouncy and romantic - is a real achievement. Stop laughing long enough, and you'll see that it's a picture about compromised lives and love for sale. But no one who watches Priceless will stop laughing for that long. This, to me, is the fun of Priceless, that double thing - the harshness wrapped in a pretty package. The movie stars Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh, who are about the only French stars that it's almost impossible to imagine having an active sex life. Their aura of innocence helps. Still, in America, no director could ever make this movie, even with the most innocent-seeming actors on the planet. This is way  European, folks, not meant for our eyes, and, of course, that's the whole kick. Tautou plays a woman who's only a step up from a call girl. Irene (Tautou) is a professional gold digger who specializes in rich old men, but not rich old men who are harmless (as they would be in a Hollywood movie), but rich old men with serious libidos that she has to answer to. At the start of the movie, she slips away from her room in a luxury hotel and meets the hotel bartender, Jean (Elmaleh), but she doesn't know he's a bartender. She thinks he's a rich guy.  The two get drunk, and get swept up in their romantic notion of each other. For Jean, Irene is something expensive and beyond the stars that's suddenly within his grasp. For Irene, Jean presents a chance to go to bed with a (supposedly rich) guy from her own generation. So they have a one-night fling, and she's gone, off with her old guy to some other watering hole for the fabulously wealthy. And that's how it all begins. ... Like every movie that deals with money and love, this one ultimately comes down on the side of love, but it doesn't hit the anti-materialistic note too hard, because it wouldn't ring true. Priceless is an entertaining sex farce that takes its characters to some of best hotels and most exclusive restaurants in France, and to watch it is to marvel at how some people live - and how you don't. Thirty thousand euros for a watch? Two hundred euros for a dinner entree? Eight hundred euros for a shirt? It's absurd and obscene and it would be really nice to have that money. But here's the interesting thing: Through this seduction, Priceless turns the viewer into a harlot, too, who can suddenly understand why Irene would do anything and sleep with anybody just to stay in this lifestyle. Likewise, we understand - instinctively, without thinking about it or judging it - why Jean might start sleeping with an older rich woman, just so he can stay in the hotels where Irene stays. Would you want to be the person who orders the drinks or fetches the drinks? How easy would it be to go back to normal life after confirming what you never really wanted to know, that the rich really do have it better, as in a lot better, as in money really does buy happiness?  So Priceless is silly, but it's not so silly. It's pretty to look at, often very funny, but it corrupts its audience as it corrupts its characters. Elmaleh (The Valet) is an excellent physical comedian with an expressive, big-eyed deadpan that he surely knows is reminiscent of Buster Keaton. (I think he's intentionally doing Keaton, and doing him well.) As for Tautou - the highest-paid actress in France - she has passed through her gamine phase and is fortunately through her sullen phase (The Da Vinci Code). Now she's getting laughs while playing a sleek and stylish woman. She has grown up, and adulthood suits her. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual content and brief female nudity.Priceless: Romantic comedy. Starring Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh.

" UP AT THE VILLA: Drama. Starring Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft. Directed by Philip Haas. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . These are the questions at the heart of Up at the Villa, a new film, based on a W. Somerset Maugham novella, that opens today. These are old questions, and good ones in that they are not as simple as our romantic inclinations might lead us to believe. Sometimes the heart is a tragically stupid guide. Sometimes the price isn't worth paying. Sometimes the cynics are right. Maugham's best-known works revolve around these questions with the obsessiveness and intricacy that are the mark of true inspiration. Rain, The Razor's Edge, Of Human Bondage and The Painted Veil have all made it to the screen in more-than-respectable adaptations. Up at the Villa, directed by Philip Haas and adapted by Belinda Haas, takes its place among the best of the Maugham adaptations. For one thing, this is the first film to make complete sense of Kristin Scott Thomas as a screen presence. Her singular and rather peculiar essence -- buttoned-up and bothered -- is perfect for Mary, a woman who spends half the movie trying to decide whether to surrender to passion or banish it from her life altogether. The picture takes place in 1938 Florence. Europe is a powder keg, but for the moment all is calm after the signing of the Munich treaty. Mary, a penniless British widow with society connections, is entertaining a marriage proposal from Sir Edgar, played by James Fox (It's mandatory that Fox appear in every British Empire period piece). Sir Edgar is 60 if he's a day, and she doesn't love him. But he's a decent enough chap and has oodles of money. Mary has to make her decision in a matter of days. In the meantime, she is staying at an Italian villa, and what a villa. The surroundings are lush Italian, while the garden has all the imposing symmetry of the English style, with an endless green footpath in which to stroll and have conversations that seem extremely important, what with all those trees standing at attention, listening. Anne Bancroft -- for once not cast as a generic witch -- plays Princess San Ferdinando, a rich American widow who married for money and is now the leader of an expatriate society in Florence. Advising Mary to marry Sir Edgar, she embodies what Mary could become: powerful, jaded, wealthy. That's not the most wholesome fate, yet it's hardly the worst way to spend one's old age. This is where Sean Penn enters the picture, as Rowley, an American with a wife somewhere and lots of love affairs in his past. A self-described good time guy, he tells Mary that she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen -- a line that wasn't new in 1938 or 1638. Penn's virtuosity as a screen actor continues to amaze. He does not look like a suave 1930s ladies' man, at least he doesn't at first, but he becomes that guy. His performance seems so natural, so graced with touches of humor and hints of self-knowledge, that one never senses an effort behind it. Penn doesn't show the technique, just the results. Up at the Villa doesn't pursue the typical direction for stories of this kind. Toward the middle of the film, a pivotal event takes place that I would love to describe, except that I enjoyed the surprise and don't want to spoil it. Suffice it to say that in the most extreme moments, Thomas hits her career pinnacle. Nobility, it turns out, is not Thomas' strong suit. Rather it's in playing women who, despite a great facade, are really a mess. Up at the Villa is enough to turn a skeptic into a fan. -- Advisory: This film contains violence. .. ",1
" Van Damme. Directed by Peter Hyams. (R. 98 minutes.) The picture is set in a near future when time travel is possible. Jean-Claude Van Damme plays Time-Enforcement Officer Walker, who is part of a government agency set up to make sure no one goes into the past and does anything to change the present. Two plot strains run through Timecop, a personal one and a political one. The personal one concerns the loss Agent Walker is carrying -- his wife (Mia Sara) was killed by intruders in 1994. The second deals with the machinations of a ruthless, maniacal senator named McComb (Ron Silver) to manipulate the past in order to Jean-Claude Van Damme is a time-enforcement officer make himself president of the United States. Aside from a brief dip into Civil War times and a visit to Wall Street after the stock market crash  of 1929, the movie is not a time travelogue but a thriller that shuttles back and forth between 2004 and 1994. Director Peter Hyams, who served as his own director of photography, uses computer morphing to indicate the schism that the time machine opens. The air ripples, then settles back down, like water. Van Damme gets plenty of chances to be heroic, but his human side gets a workout, too. The picture provides him with his best acting opportunities to date -- for example, the touching scene in which he is shown in 2004 watching 10-year-old videotapes of his dead wife. ",1
" WAG THE DOG: Satire. Starring Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Anne Heche. Directed by Barry Levinson. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture, which opens today, is directed by Barry Levinson in a low-key style that makes the farfetched seem possible. Levinson's sure touch keeps audiences smiling and manages to maintain an aura of good nature in a film that, at heart, offers a caustic, almost bitter vision of American institutions and contemporary politics.  American Hero was the title of the original novel by Larry Beinhart, on which film is based. The new title is better. Adapted by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet, the picture begins with riddle: Why does the dog wag the tail? Why doesn't the tail wag the dog? The answer: Because the dog is smarter than the tail. The satire presents an America in which the public is like a sleeping dog, getting wagged every which way by corrupt leaders and a lazy, cowardly media. Robert De Niro, in his gentle- dangerous mode, plays Brean, an expert in political damage control who's called in to the White House. The president, up for re-election in two weeks, has molested a teenage girl. Something big needs to happen to distract the public from the sex scandal, and Brean comes up with a good one. A war. Not a real war, but one manufactured in Hollywood. The movie takes delight in satirizing the ways in which politicians manipulate the media. The White House press secretary announces, The president's visit has nothing to do with the deployment of the B-3 bomber, and everyone believes it has everything to do with the B-3 bomber. Setting the stage for war with Albania, the administration leaks rumors about Albanian Muslim fundamentalists, and the story leads the news. As the Hollywood honcho brought in to create the fake war with Albania, Dustin Hoffman has one of his funniest roles. He plays Motss, a producer longing for acknowledgment, eager to show what he can do. You think this is hard? he says. Try a 10 a.m. pitch meeting, coked to the gills, and you haven't even read the treatment. That's hard. This is easy. Between the laughs, there are moments that ring so true they can raise goosebumps. In one scene, a young actress runs across a blue soundstage. In the control room, technicians use computer graphics to put a kitten in her arms and a smoldering Albanian village around her. It's that easy. Another amusing yet creepy moment shows a chorus recording a We Are the World-like anthem, The American Dream, celebrating the Albanian war. (The anthem was, in fact, written by Tom Bahler, who co-wrote We Are the World.) Pretty voices and a slick production can make the most cynical enterprise sound glorious. Wag the Dog neither flags nor spirals out of control as the satire deepens. Hoffman and De Niro are in most scenes together, and their pleasure at playing off of each other is visible. As a presidential aide, Anne Heche helps anchor the picture as a bystander in the midst of the madness, a kind of stand-in for the audience. Other famous faces turn up in feature roles: Denis Leary plays an expert in fads, and Willie Nelson plays a country music singer, of all things. Most vivid is Woody Harrelson as a violent psychotic let out of a military prison to play a war hero. His brief performance is an all-out parody of Billy Bob Thornton's in Sling Blade. You think he's hard to handle, says Hoffman. Try three Italian starlets whacked out on Benzedrine and grappa. That's hard. ",1
" War drama. Starring Pyotr Fyodorov, Thomas Kretschmann, Yanina Studilina and Mariya Smolnikova. Directed by Fedor Bondarchuk. (R. 131 minutes.) We've seen so many war movies in America that part of us thinks that war makes sense, particularly World War II. But the Russians know things that we don't know. They know that even winning a war can be disastrous. World War II cost 400,000 American lives, a big number, but the Soviet Union lost over 24 million. Or to put it another way, more than 1 out of 8 people in the Soviet Union died in World War II. Such traumas produce a different kind of war movie, and so we get Stalingrad, a huge hit in Russia and the first Russian film ever made in 3-D Imax. This film constitutes an Imax breakthrough, in that it's the first to use 3-D Imax for serious artistic ends. It makes the war very close, very big and very disturbing, and though it would be too much to say that Stalingrad makes the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan look like a trip to Disneyland, the sensory bombardment is of a whole other order.  Early in the film, there's a massive explosion, and we all know movie explosions - by now they have no effect on us. Oh, but this one does. This one feels like the theater is going to go next. This is followed by a horrifying battle in which the Soviet Army, literally on fire from spilled fuel, makes an insane charge on a line of German machine guns. It's a vision of hell - men on fire, vaulting over the front lines and hugging the Germans so that they'll be set on fire, too.  The Russians, either by experience, temperament or both, have a wider range of emotion with regard to World War II. Because our war films take place within the 40-yard lines, by comparison, Stalingrad may be jarring to us. It's at once more sentimental and more nihilistic than anything we're used to.  The story itself is rather small scale. It concerns five Soviet soldiers, who take cover in a building and hold it against a German onslaught in order to prevent the enemy from gaining access to the Volga. These soldiers are colorful and varied.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the lines, there's a German captain, who seems to be a committed Nazi, and yet has no stomach for German atrocities. He is played by Thomas Kretschmann, who has practically made a career of playing conscience-torn Nazi officers. In fact, this is Kretschmann's second trip to this particular field of battle. He starred in a German film called Stalingrad in 1993. After a devastating opening, the movie gets sluggish here and there, but it remains interesting throughout, not just culturally, but as a piece of drama. Just don't expect the filmmaker to hold your hand and tell you everything is going to be all right. It's not that kind of movie. By the way, Stalingrad director Fedor Bondarchuk is the son of Sergei Bondarchuk, whose Battle of Borodino in War and Peace (1967), set during the Napoleonic wars, is still considered one of the greatest battle re-creations in cinema history. So Dad would be proud.",1
" Western drama. Starring Sam Shepard, Eduardo Noriega and Stephen Rea. Directed by Mateo Gil. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Nobody really knows what happened to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Supposedly they were killed in a South American shootout in 1908, but the evidence is vague, and there are conflicting claims that at least Butch survived into his 70s. Grounded in that alternate history, Blackthorn imagines a scenario for Butch's later years and gives us a different kind of Western - somber, reflective and set in the elevated plains and salt flats of Bolivia. It takes place in 1927. Sundance is dead. Etta is dead, and Butch, who goes by the name of Blackthorn, has a white beard. He has transformed from wisecracking Paul Newman into Sam Shepard, who doesn't joke much. By his early 40s, Shepard already carried an aura of deep, lived-in history, and by now he is like a living monument, who can just sit and say nothing and make you think, wow, this guy has seen things. So what better actor to play a notorious outlaw who has grown into his regrets and yet is still dangerous? These days all Butch wants to do is cash out and go home. A horse dealer in Bolivia, he sells everything he's got with the intention of going back to America and seeing Etta's son, who is also Sundance's son - or maybe Butch's - see, this is why they called it the Wild West. But something keeps him in Bolivia and throws him together with a Spanish thief, played by Eduardo Noriega - who looks like a young, healthy Marcello Mastroianni. The film's central adventure involves the men's effort to retrieve $50,000 and escape the country. This caper aspect is enough to keep the narrative chugging along, but the film's main appeal comes from character interaction and the movie's exploration of Butch's moral nature, which is also revealed in a series of flashbacks. It's a funny thing how modern 1927 can look after a quick visit to 1900 - and that sense of modernity emphasizes Butch's dislocation. He's a man from the previous century, and anyone who feels a few beats behind today's technology might easily identify. Miguel Barros' screenplay doesn't look back or build on the 1969 Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But it does throw in one reference that's irresistible if you catch it. At one point, as six horsemen are gaining on them, Blackthorn turns to the Spaniard and advises they dash out into the desert. The desert will kill you before they do, he says. Get it?",1
" Western. Starring Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld and Matt Damon. Directed by the Coen brothers. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The image of John Wayne riding with two guns, an eye patch and his horse's reins between his teeth still lives as part as Hollywood iconography. But it has been 41 long years since the original True Grit was made - time enough for another go at it. After all, 1969 is to us what 1928 was to 1969, or to reverse it, we are to 1969 what 2051 is to us, so distant it's presumptuous even to think about it. True Grit is the new Coen brothers movie, for which they went back to the original source, the novel of the same name by Charles Portis. This new version wallows in historically accurate filth, relishes bad teeth and occasionally approaches situations with some distance and a hint of absurdity, though not as much absurdity as you might expect from the Coens. For the most part, True Grit is a regular Western - not a re-imagining of the genre or of the original movie, but a straightforward and fairly engaging attempt to do it for real and do it right.  If there's one big difference between this version and the old, it's in the attitude toward violence. The new version may be more graphic, but it doesn't present violence as inevitable or necessary, just ugly. What a far cry from the '69 version, with director Henry Hathaway blasting triumphant Western music every time Wayne was about to kill somebody. Hathaway's vision suggested that all this bloodletting was merely a symptom of a great nation's growing pains, and to him these violent men, villains and heroes, were part of some bigger-than-life mosaic. Hathaway respected even the bad guys, while the Coens see even the good guys as messy, deluded and faintly pathetic. This goes for Rooster Cogburn, played by Jeff Bridges as a fat slob, cunning but not too bright, and definitely more than a hard drinker - more like a drunk not far from hitting bottom. He's hired by Mattie, a 14-year-old girl - here played by an actual 14-year-old girl, Hailee Steinfeld - to bring the man who killed her father to justice. Of course, if Rooster were to kill the guy outright, she wouldn't really mind that, either. Rooster sets out on the trail of the culprit, joined, at first, by a fussy Texas Ranger, played with sly humor by Matt Damon, and by Mattie, who has spunk. Along the way, not once do the Coens pull back to show magnificent Western vistas that suggest an overarching order to the universe. The Coens are more Anthony Mann than John Ford. Their West is a great outdoors answer to film noir Los Angeles, in which everything is murky and a pathway between two mountains is as discomforting as a blind alley. As in noir, there are wise and quirky characters, too: Dakin Matthews is particularly memorable as a shady horse trader, a role originally played by Strother Martin. For Rooster, Bridges rolls out his ornery cuss mode, and he's good at it, though if he's going to play yet another countrified alcoholic in a single year, I kind of wish he'd sing Fallin' & Flying again, too. His achievement is not that he's better than Wayne - you can't really argue with the image of Wayne onscreen - but rather that when Bridges is up there, Wayne doesn't cross the mind. For some reason, the Coens eliminate most contractions from the dialogue, giving it an artificial feel, and the burden of this falls most strongly on young Miss Steinfeld. Still, she's quite believable and appealing as a precocious and competent young lady, all business and a little reminiscent, in her authority and presence, of the juvenile Natalie Portman in The Phantom Menace. My only reservation about the movie, not a serious one but a nagging one, is that watching the film it's hard to see why the Coens wanted to make it. It's a respectable, entertaining Western, but it's not so radically different or innovative that their need to make it seems overpowering. I guess we should just assume that the Coens had a hankering to make a pretty good Western. So they did.-- Advisory: Strong violence, alcohol abuse.",1
" Willis, Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by John McTiernan. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The latest, like the glorious and slightly absurd Die Hard II, is not a thinking person's action picture. Rather it counts on its ability to keep you from thinking. For the most part it succeeds: the Bonwit Teller store in New York blows up . . . Lieutenant John McClane (Bruce Willis) drives a taxi through Central Park (not on the road, but through the park) . . . There are chases, helicopter battles, life-and- death races against time. An audience on the edge of its seat doesn't quibble about plot points. There are two things the picture can't keep you from thinking about or at least noticing. One is the macabre coincidence between  one of the situations in this film -- mad bomber Jeremy Irons plans to blow up an elementary school -- and the Oklahoma tragedy. The other is the film's curious emotional shallowness, even for a Die Hard movie. The previous Die Hard featured McClane trying to save his wife from danger. This was a small but significant part of the mix. But the emotional release at the end of Die Hard II, when McClane and his wife were reunited, has no equivalent here. With a Vengeance just leaves you pumped up and exhausted, with only a generic satisfaction that the good guy is still alive for another sequel. If this is the weakest of the Die Hard films, that's why. The per sonal end of the film is vague. We find out only that McClane is separated from his wife, for reasons that are unconvincing at best. The buddy relationship offered in its place -- McClane hooks up with a Harlem electrical shop owner (Samuel L. Jackson) -- plays the race card for some refreshing and unexpected laughs. It should come as no surprise that Jonathan Hensleigh's script was not originally written as a Die Hard film. The blend of Die Hard and With a Vengeance is sometimes smooth but never complete. It's as if Die Hard were wearing a rented tux. Still, the flaws here are easy to forgive once the film starts cooking, and it starts cooking right away. After the Bonwit Teller explosion, the mad bomber calls the police and asks to speak to McClane. By threatening to strike again, the bomber gets McClane doing dangerous stunts all over the city. One of those stunts puts McClane in Harlem wearing an antagonistic sandwich board. A store owner named Zeus (Jackson) saves his life, and from there the two are linked, at least in the bomber's mind. McClane has a partner, and the two race around Manhattan trying to solve the bomber's riddles -- and ducking for cover when all else fails. Irons' bomber is a German with an English accent -- or an Englishman with a German accent -- or something else. It's never quite clear. But he's foreign, i.e. a bad guy. Irons looks great -- youthful, buffed and lean -- but for most of Die Hard With a Vengeance he walks through the part (not that you can completely blame him). Willis is exactly what you'd expect and more so, a smirky, likable slob, and Jackson, who shared little or no screen time with Willis in Pulp Fiction, provides good balance. He's tense where Willis is laid-back, angry where Willis is ironic. With Jackson, it's always personal. The film is constructed as a se-  ries of action scenes, escalating in tension and danger. McClane rides in an elevator and on the way down realizes he's with four fake cops who intend to kill him. How ever will he get out? In another scene McClane, driving a truck through huge, empty underground viaducts, hears a rumbling in the distance. Oh, no -- someone has turned on the water. Die Hard With a Vengeance has scale and imagination, as well as a climax straight out of D.W. Griffith, with the picture intercutting between two simultaneous races against time. The film dips a bit near the finish when, like Speed last year, it offers up a second climax that just can't top what's gone before. ",1
" by Steve James. (PG-13. 171 minutes.) Hoop Dreams, now available on home video, is a massive work that traces five years in the lives of two young men, William Gates and Arthur Agee, possible NBA prospects, who start off as 14-year-olds playing basketball in a school yard. Though the movie clocks in at just under three hours, it is -- aside from an occasional slow spot -- fascinating and exciting. The highlights of real-life basketball games here are as suspenseful and gripping as any games on live television. Arthur and William are people the audience comes to care about, so it matters whether William makes  the game-winning point from the free-throw line or Arthur's team wins the city championship. Both boys, who come from poor families, see basketball as their one small chance to make it out of the ghetto. In fact, they might have other tickets available to them, such as an education, but basketball is the one they recognize and the one their parents and friends are most invested in. Everybody is my coach, William says. They ask me, 'Will you remember me when you're in the NBA?' I should ask them, 'Will you remember me if I'm not in the NBA?'  Hoop Dreams explores the culture of basketball in the black community. It details how budding talent is recognized, rewarded and sometimes exploited by the basketball machinery. Though both are good kids, Arthur and William are very different. William is gentle, diffident and eager to please, while Arthur is more of a slacker and a wise guy. Throughout you tend to worry more about Arthur, who seems more likely to get into trouble. Yet Arthur has a kind of oblivious resilience that William lacks. In Hoop Dreams the mechanism of the athlete emerges as something as finely tuned and fragile as that of the artist. William is good because he's confident and innovative; and he's confident and innovative because he's good. But when his confidence is interrupted, he becomes for a time like a centipede trying to remember which leg to move first. ",1
"  Action. Starring Hugh Jackman, Rila Fukushima and Tao Okamoto. Directed by James Mangold. (PG-13. 120 minutes.)Somewhere along the line somebody must have had a crazy idea, that maybe for once the Wolverine required a decent script, and shouldn't rely only on action, audience goodwill and the sight of Hugh Jackman with his shirt off. And so a team was assembled, made up of people who have made some very good movies.Those movies are too many to list here, but for a taste: Director James Mangold made Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma, and screenwriters Mark Bomback, Scott Frank and Christopher McQuarrie made Live Free or Die Hard, Out of Sight and The Usual Suspects, respectively. This time out, nobody is slumming.Within five minutes, it's apparent that the audience, and The Wolverine, are in good hands. The movie, a sequel to 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, begins with three gripping sequences, including a vivid one in which our hero survives the atomic bomb blast at Nagasaki. Of course he does - he's that kind of person. His hair and skin may be burned off, but he flexes and growls, and a moment later, everything has grown back.Less immediately apparent than the quality of the action is the subtle and welcome change the filmmakers have wrought in Wolverine. Of the mutant superhero X-Men, he was always the sad sack, the depressive, the self-hating one, the one who didn't want to use his powers; but in The Wolverine, he is less angst-ridden, and more angry and motivated, which activates the movie.DF-19280r Logan (Hugh Jackman) races into a battle that's shattered a sacred ceremony.DF-19280r Logan (Hugh Jackman) races into a battle that's shattered a sacred ceremony.At the start, he is drifting and haunted by nightmares, but he still has the gumption to pick a fight when he witnesses an injustice. In the best way, he is more like a straight-up action hero - no longer a miserable guy like Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man, but capable, dangerous and, when it's called for, sarcastic.The clash between mutants and humans has been the relentless focus of previous X-Men movies. The Wolverine drops that exhausted subject in favor of something more clear-cut and immediate: The Wolverine is asked to travel to Japan in order to say goodbye to the man whose life he saved in Nagasaki. The Wolverine, who's not doing much of anything these days besides growing out his sideburns, agrees, and soon gets involved in a tangled and dangerous conflict over the old man's will. The old man skips over his own son and makes his granddaughter, Marika (Tao Okamoto), the richest woman in Asia.A nice feature of The Wolverine is that it always stays with our hero, and his task is always simple and easy to grasp, despite whatever complicating machinations are taking place off camera. He saves Marika's life - as soon as people find out that she is about to inherit everything, armies of assassins pop out from everywhere - and he becomes determined to keep her alive. Why? Because he's a nice guy, and he likes her.Unfortunately, the Wolverine is not the best relationship material at the moment. He can't go to sleep without having nightmares that cause him to leap out of the sheets, waving his adamantine knuckle blades, ready to kill anything that moves. Handsome or not, he is definitely a case for separate beds.The Wolverine is the first film from the X-Men universe to show Jackman to full advantage. The actor has worked himself into a physical condition that is downright humbling, or inspiring, depending on your viewpoint, and his performance is in the best action tradition of strength and humor.The action sequences are not perfunctory and, though they had to have been cooked up on a computer, they don't look like it. Or at least, they're imaginative enough that you don't have time to think of them in that way.For example, there's a chase on top of a train, a familiar action-movie trope last seen as recently as The Lone Ranger, a few weeks ago. But the chase in The Wolverine takes place on a Japanese bullet train going 300 mph, which completely changes the dynamic. The scene is faster, quieter and more eerie, and the fighting requires different strategies.The Wolverine shows that, while originality would be nice, a little novelty and enthusiasm in the presentation of the familiar can be quite enough. The bottom line is that audiences aren't stupid and will not settle for just anything, as the anemic box office for recent blockbusters is showing. The Wolverine deserves to break out from the pack.",1
"  Drama. Starring Russell Crowe, Anthony Hopkins and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. (PG-13. 138 minutes.)At first it sounds as if the wind is making a strangled wailing, as it blows through the slats of Noah's ark. But a closer listen reveals it as the sound of people screaming, of thousands trying to stay afloat and sinking. It's layer upon layer of human noise, piled and piled until it sounds elemental - as Noah and his family sit in the middle of the ark, dry, safe and horrified.Noah is no silly action blockbuster with a biblical pretext. Rather, it's the product of writer-director Darren Aronofsky's vigorous engagement with the biblical story and what it might mean in our time. The story itself has demands built in: It posits a vision of humanity gone astray, in which those on the side of the Creator are pitted against those opposed to the divine will. Right off, that means a filmmaker's choosing sides and making decisions about good and bad, right and wrong.In Aronofsky's telling, humanity went in two directions after the murder of Abel by Cain. The godless sons of Cain went off and created the industrial world, raping the Earth. They became warriors, fashioned metal weapons and began eating animals. They ignored the demands of stewardship and stressed only their dominion over the Earth and other living creatures. Meanwhile, the virtuous sons of Seth lived off the land, in harmony with creation. They were vegetarians, proto-environmentalists and anti-industry.Of course, Noah is going to be controversial. It was either that or have something dead onscreen, and Noah is most certainly not dead. Yet even those who think a meal isn't a meal without a hunk of bleeding pain on the plate might be assuaged by the movie's pro-industry statement, hiding there in plain sight: The sons of Cain are living a lot better than the sons of Seth. Ten generations since Adam, and all Noah has to show for himself is a tattered tent pitched amid the rocks.In fact, as the movie begins, Seth's descendants consist of no one but Noah's family, as the murderous sons of Cain draw nearer. Things are looking hopeless when Noah (Russell Crowe) has a curious dream in which he envisions the destruction of the world. He doesn't know what it means, or what he's supposed to do about it, and so he goes in search of his grandfather, Methuselah, for guidance. And Methuselah can only be Anthony Hopkins, who plays the oldest man in the world like a chipper, jovial, Welsh Yoda.The early biblical world is portrayed by Aronofsky as a place of barren desolation, of rocks and hard earth. When characters talk about saying goodbye to life as they know it, one has to wonder what's there to miss. At the same time, the film is full of beautiful visuals, as when two doves suddenly decide to head toward the ark, and the camera tracks them above as they fly.Noah provides two striking instances of silhouettes against the sky. In the first, Noah and his wife (Jennifer Connelly) discuss their options, just as the night is cracking and a new day is vibrating a golden glow on the horizon. In another scene, we see men killing each other - time-lapse photography of various silhouettes in various hats swinging various weapons - a succession that, when reduced to spectacle, looks like nothing but madness.The film's special effects never seem special in the moment, which is as it should be. When every snake and reptile on the Earth starts heading in one direction, the viewer's response isn't awe at what can be done on a computer but awe at the abundant forms that life takes. Everything must be saved, Noah says, lest a small piece of creation be lost forever. It's our job to look after them.Crowe ably conveys the oppressive weight of Noah's responsibility, the burden of enacting God's will. But then, all the performances are strong, which is the mark of good direction. No one postures, no one plays history. Every actor has clearly spent time contemplating and working through the specific and real emotions being experienced by the character. Emma Watson is lovely, as a young woman whose inability to conceive makes her an odd match for Noah's eldest son. Ray Winstone, as a general of the house of Cain, is a complex figure - a villain, perhaps, but the one character who sounds most like a modern man.Noah is a great movie until the ark's doors close. Then for a half hour, it becomes a strange and difficult movie, more interesting than satisfying. But ultimately, Noah finds its way back to land. Unlike most action movies, it's the furthest thing from a cynical piece of work. It's a movie to wrestle with and talk about. ",1
"Cars 2, the latest from Pixar, is the sequel to the 2006 Cars, from the same studio, but it's a much different movie. It mostly keeps the same lineup of characters and maintains the conceit of a world in which people don't exist and cars talk and have emotions. But in terms of story and atmosphere and overall feeling, Cars 2 is a brand-new experience - and a distinct improvement.The previous Cars was pretty much a coming-of-age drama, in which an ambitious young car (Owen Wilson) learned life lessons. Inevitably, it was sentimental. But Cars 2 is a spy story taking place against an international background. It's lively and packed with incident and serious consequence, and even without the cars gimmick - with a few adjustments to convert the script from cars to people - the movie would work. It's solid enough to stand on its own, and the car aspect is just a plus, a charming, whimsical embellishment.This time out the cars no longer seem so earthbound, so locked into being heavy hunks of metal that can barely touch. The cars, as physical entities, have been reconceived as more pliable and interactive, and one gets the sense that technology - that is, movie technology - has aided in this. The whole visual atmosphere of Cars 2 is more expansive and free than its predecessor and more of a delight to watch.Owen Wilson is back as Lightning McQueen, now established as one of the world's premier race cars. Larry the Cable Guy is the voice of the rusty tow truck, Mater, who becomes central to the story, and in shrewd ways. New to the scene is Michael Caine, as a car working for the British secret service, along with his assistant (Emily Mortimer). The British agent discovers that some kind of diabolical international conspiracy is afoot, and soon the players all converge on Europe, where a series of races will determine who is the fastest car in the world.It might seem strange that locations should play an important role in an animated film, and yet Cars 2 really does benefit from the glamour of its settings, which tells you just how well they're realized. The movie travels to Paris, to Italy and to London, and the re-creations of these cities are hardly perfunctory. The detailing is specific, but with subtle and clever alterations made to accommodate that these are cities for cars, not people.In Cars 2, we meet some of the legendary lemons of yesteryear - Gremlins, Yugos, Pacers - cars you might have regarded as forlorn or unlucky, but here they're villains with chips on their shoulders, angry that no one makes parts for them any longer. Like a lot of things in this movie, that notion is funny in the abstract, but it also works as part of the story's psychological grounding.Among the many nice touches is the soundtrack, with its hint of '60s-era British spy movies. Incidental, and yet very much a part of the background, is an underlying message about the relative morality of big oil companies and major conglomerates. That's not something you expect to get in what is essentially a kids film, but it's not uninteresting and not unwelcome.Owen Wilson has a recognizable earnestness in his voice, and Larry the Cable Guy gets some of the best laughs. But the treat of Cars 2 is Michael Caine, who seems quite at home in his car incarnation. If he were a car, this is precisely the kind of car he would be. Animation.

"ME MYSELF I  Romantic comedy. Starring Rachel Griffiths. Directed by Pip Karmel. (R. 104 minutes. At the Embarcadero Center Cinemas.) . Rachel Griffiths plays Pamela, an award-winning journalist in her 30s. Professionally and financially, she is in great shape, but there's no man in her life. She finds herself almost suicidally lonely, and she pines for Robert, a man she rejected 13 years before. This is where things get interesting. She gets into a minor accident, and next thing she knows, she is meeting, face to face, Pamela Two -- the version of herself who married Robert. Pamela Two takes Pamela One to her suburban home. Then just as the kids come home from school, Pamela Two vanishes, leaving Pamela One irretrievably stuck in married Pamela's life -- caring for kids she doesn't know and locked in an all but burnt-out marriage to Robert. Sliding Doors, the Gwyneth Paltrow movie, tried a similar scenario but failed by not making the two Gwyneths' lives all that different. In Me Myself I the differences are profound. Each life has its rewards; each its trade-offs. The switch makes for plenty of amusing situations, but at heart this is a thoughtful, well-made movie about something serious. -- Advisory: This movie contains strong language. Mick LaSalle  Drama. Starring Ian Holm, Stanley Tucci. Directed by Tucci. Written by Howard A. Rodman. (R. 108 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) I an Holm is a great actor, and in Joe Gould's Secret, a film directed by Stanley Tucci, he nails one of the best roles of his career. The subject is Joe Gould, an artist/bum who became a celebrity thanks to a 1942 magazine article in the New Yorker. Vagrant and poet, genius and humbug, Gould was one of Manhattan's legendary eccentrics. Disheveled, toothless and exasperating even to the collection of artists who supported him with donations, Gould was a writer who claimed to be working on the Oral History of Time, a 9 million-word opus built from overheard conversations. In Joe Gould's Secret, Tucci opens the possibility that Gould was a sham, that he was only pretending to be writing his epic, just as Truman Capote later did with Answered Prayers. Tucci, who directs with quiet affection and rare restraint, also plays Joseph Mitchell, the reserved journalist who befriended Gould and introduced him to his readers. His film salutes the spirit of Gould and asks if a man of such extravagant idiosyncrasy could be appreciated today, and not dismissed. Played by Holm, he's an entertaining figure, but a tragic one: a man of enormous gifts who lacked the emotional apparatus to turn those gifts into work. Joe Gould's Secret is about friendship, writer's block, the challenge of fitting in and the thin border between madness and creativity. Along with Holm and Tucci, the cast includes Hope Davis as Tucci's photographer wife, Steve Martin as a publisher who's sympathetic to Gould, Patricia Clarkson as a gallery owner and Susan Sarandon as artist Alice Neel. Edward Guthman  Political melodrama. Starring Sandrine Bonnaire and Oleg Menchikov. Featuring Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier. (Not rated. 124 minutes. In French and Russian with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) East-West is a kind of movie we haven't seen in a while, the Cold War political melodrama. This French film, directed by Regis Wargnier (Indochine), not only deals with a period more than 50 years ago, but it seems to come from that era, too. It is well-made in an old-fashioned way, and its straight-arrow lack of cynicism may be old- fashioned as well. There is even a reasonable facsimile of Paul Henreid, the eternal refugee (Casablanca), in Russian actor Oleg Menchikov, as a Russian physician in France lured back to help rebuild the mother country after World War II. Sandrine Bonnaire has the Kristin Scott Thomas role as his coolly high-minded French wife, brought low by deception, domestic and state-sponsored. Instead of repatriation, they find paranoid, Stalinist oppression. It becomes a drama about those who play along and those who resist. The wife's frigidity toward her husband grows, as she can barely disguise how desperately she wants to get out of Russia and cannot abide his apparent willingness to cooperate. They are drawn to other lovers in this claustrophobic, voices-through- the-wall world of denunciations, forced labor and narrow-lipped fervor for the state. Catherine Deneuve, who starred in Wargnier's Indochine a decade ago, has a small but key part. As Deneuve eases into grande dame roles, she plays a touring great lady of the French theater who has political connections -- and moxie. Bob Graham  Documentary. Starring Annabel Chong. Directed by Gough Lewis. (Not rated. 86 minutes. At the Lumiere.) In ancient times, people who disgraced themselves were stoned to death. In modern times, they have documentaries made about them. Sanity cries out for a happy medium -- say, ignoring them altogether. Which brings us to Sex: The Annabel Chong Story. Chong (real name: Grace Quek) was a USC student/porn actress who in January 1995 reached the pinnacle. She had sex with 251 men in 10 hours, setting a record and, in the process, making the video The World's Biggest Gang Bang. Alas, like Miss America, Chong got to keep her crown for only a year. In 1996, another woman bedded 300 men. The documentary's funniest and most pathetic sight is Chong on the set of Gang Bang 2, putting on a brave face as her one claim to fame is about to be taken away. Sex: The Annabel Chong Story has many grotesque sex scenes, interspersed with sights of Chong rambling in a dissociated way as she sits in her squalid apartment. Chong tries to present the gang bang as a feminist statement, carting out the sort of relativist doublespeak that passes for thinking in naive circles. But she's a victim -- of the porn producers, who promised her 10 grand and never paid up; and of the documentary, which keeps feeding her the one drug she doesn't need: The illusion of celebrity. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity and graphic sex. Mick LaSalle  Comedy-drama. Starring Nancho Novo, Cayetana Guillen Cuervo and Ingrid Rubio. Directed by Alfonso Albacete, Miguel Bardem and David Menkes. (Not rated. 103 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) Not Love Just Frenzy is a 1996 Spanish hit that finally is getting distribution in the United States. It's the work of three first- time directors who collaborated on the characters and the story. The result is like an Almodovar movie that has taken an ugly pill. As in Almodovar's films, there is graphic sex and scenes of passionate people behaving recklessly. The pace is frenetic, and there's an underworld quality. But Not Love Just Frenzy is too conscious of its own hipness. Nothing like Almodovar's embracing sense of humanity is present. Neither is the humor. These guys studied Almodovar, got the lyrics down, but had no feel for the music. The essential story revolves around Max (Nancho Novo), who is wanted for killing a woman, though he claims he's innocent. As a fanatical cop pursues him, he is trying to reunite with Yeye (Ingrid Rubio), his old girlfriend, while allowing himself to be seduced by Monica (Cayetana Guillen Cuervo), a hard- living barmaid. The film is more prurient than daring, and whenever there is a lull in the action, the filmmakers bring in a trio of unfunny drag queens. The only way to enjoy the drag queens is to see them as symbolic of the three directors, victims of a style that they can't quite inhabit -- but flaunting it, all the same. -- Advisory: This film contains graphic violence and nudity.

"Panic will inspire two types of reactions. People who go to movies just so they can walk out complaining, But that wasn't realistic! will be made apoplectic by this film's unlikely turns. Others, who have a taste for the dramatic, the absurd and the exaggerated, will find themselves on the movie's wavelength. William H. Macy stars -- that always helps -- as Alex, a man in his 40s who is beginning to have moral qualms about walking up to strangers and shooting them. Maybe it's just a phase, but he's depressed, so he goes to a psychiatrist (John Ritter). He meets a young woman, played by Neve Campbell, in the waiting room. In his own low-key way, he falls immediately in love with her. Strange enough. She falls in love with him. That's not just strange -- that's science fiction. But the award for most strange in Panic goes to Donald Sutherland, who reaches the apotheosis of his corporate sleaze roles as Alex's dad. Dad started the killing business and trained Alex in it from an early age by having the boy shoot squirrels. Ah, those cozy walks in the woods with Father! Now he gives Alex a new assignment. He tells him to kill his psychiatrist. Writer-director Henry Bromell makes good use of Sutherland's remarkably unreassuring smile and gives him a handful of scenes in which he gets to act like a sadistic wacko. Fun stuff. Panic is not the kind of movie anyone will remember at Oscar time. But no one who sees it will forget it. This film contains strong language and violence. -- Mick LaSalle This atmospheric film, even with its self-conscious style, is a show of major talent by Lou, a young director who is one of the group of breakthrough filmmakers called China's Sixth Generation who have been influenced by contemporary American and European movies. The love story blends the gritty world of petty criminals in gloomy Shanghai with the obsessions and enigmas of romance. Suzhou River, named after the busy commercial waterway running through Shanghai, deftly uses the city as a shadow character: People go about their lives as a documentarian might catch them on film. The videographer in the film, an obsessive voyeur, is unnamed, and the story is mostly from his point of view. Advertising for work on street-corner walls using graffiti-like spray-painted lettering, he regards the world from his tiny riverside apartment, imagining stories about the parade of humanity crossing a bridge. He is crazy about a nightclub performer, Meimei (Zhou Xun, The Emperor and the Assassin), who swims like a mermaid in a large aquarium. Wearing a blond wig, she's the main attraction for bar patrons. One day a motorcycle courier named Mardar (Jia Hongsheng) tells the videographer the heartbreaking story of a girl named Moudan (also Zhou), the innocent daughter of a smuggler with whom he had an affair. When the chips were down he betrayed her, and she jumped into the dark Suzhou River clutching her favorite doll, a mermaid. Are they the same person, this delicate Moudan of playful innocence and the hardened, seductive Meimei? Suzhou River is both a puzzle and a revelation. The film is energized by the naturalness of its characters and the way in which it plays a game of mixed signals and double illusions. This movie contains graphic violence. -- Peter Stack Helen Garvy, who directed the film and also narrates, was one of the idealistic, hardworking students who joined the SDS, and her film is an act of nostalgia. I wanted to capture that period as it was for us, she says on camera, (and show) how we were changed as the events of that amazing decade swirled around us. It's often a mistake for documentary makers to tackle subjects in which they're deeply involved, and Garvy's film, though compelling in parts, is overly ambitious and plodding. She assembles a lot of fascinating material, and some of her witnesses, including Tom Hayden, scholar Todd Gitlin and former Weather Underground member Bernardine Dohrn, are eloquent and moving. Arranged chronologically, Rebels relies solely on talking heads and archival footage and seems at times like an epic rehash of the events of the '60s -- events familiar to anyone who saw the Oscar-nominated Berkeley in the '60s. It rambles, it's repetitive, but once in a while there's a sparkling moment when someone speaks in a way that conjures the fierce passion of the '60s. It was all just one scalding wound, says former SDS leader Carl Oglesby. You woke up every morning to new news of abominations. . . . The American Constitution died a little bit with every can of napalm that got dropped, with every village that was taken over. In that last part of the film, when we see the growth of the anti-war movement and learn about the fragmenting of SDS and the formation of the Weather Underground, Rebels comes alive. Had Garvy focused on that piece of history instead of being overly inclusive, Rebels might have had the cumulative power that it lacks. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"Respiro is a diffuse film, suggesting several plot directions without following through on them. But director Emanuele Crialese is trying not to make a statement but to conjure a feeling -- or perhaps a vague awareness -- of a mystical undertone at work in this world of bleached earth and blue waters. On its own terms, the movie succeeds. Like a fable, its meanings are unspecific but haunting. Valeria Golino, a Greek-Italian actress who has played mainly delicate women in her American films (Rain Man), comes into her womanly glory in Respiro, evoking a kind of barefoot, fiery sensuality most often associated with Golino's fellow Neapolitan, Sophia Loren. Crialese photographs her in a way that makes her look positively mythic, with the kind of beauty and alertness of expression one might see on a classical sculpture. Island living is not easy in Respiro. The terrain is rocky, and the whole economy revolves around the sea. Golino plays Grazia, a mother of three who, like every other woman she knows, is married to a fisherman and works in a factory, cleaning fish. Maybe it's the confinement of the life, or maybe a genetic time bomb has gone off in her head, but by the start of the film, she has already become increasingly erratic. The more she becomes ostracized, the more she bonds with her 12-year-old son, and that relationship becomes the heart of the movie. For all its aspiration to a kind of mysticism, Respiro effortlessly captures an elemental truth about Italian sons and mothers -- the ease, the particular familiarity and (Hollywood stereotypes aside) the lack of hysteria of that connection. . This film contains brief nudity and some strong language in subtitle. -- Mick LaSalle . Manito, the story of two Hispanic brothers in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, is a low-budget wonder: rough and gritty around the edges, filmed for what looks like a budget of $1.98, but bristling with energy, passion and intimacy. Sometimes, lack of polish comes across as affectation or simply reveals the filmmaker's incompetence. In the case of Manito, the movie debut of writer- director Eric Eason, the roughness suits the material and the milieu. Using untrained actors, Eason tells the story of Junior (Frankie G.), a released convict trying to make good, and his gifted kid brother Manny (Leo Minaya). College-bound Manny is graduating from high school and Junior, bursting with pride, wants to honor him with a big celebration. In a beautiful scene of sweet, soaring emotion, Manny's homeboys, family and tearful brother stand up to salute his spirit and promise. Their father, estranged ever since Junior took the fall for him in a drug bust, is tossed out when he shows up at the party. Eason is so good at establishing Manny's levelheadedness -- and creates such an exultant high with the graduation party -- that the events that follow seem doubly tragic. After the graduation party, Manny takes his girlfriend home, runs into trouble with two thugs in a subway train and makes a poor decision. Junior, struggling to break a cycle of violence (and yet conditioned by it), steps up to defend him. Manito, which won an ensemble acting award at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, is performed by actors who come from the world that Eason portrays -- and in each case seem incapable of a false or extraneous note. Seasoned actors study for years to attain the honesty and freshness that these first- timers deliver. . This film contains raw language, violence and sexual situations. -- Edward Guthmann . Who would have thought those bright minds at Nickelodeon would come up with a stinker? With a sterling track record that runs from two Rugrats films to The Wild Thornberrys Movie and the Oscar-nominated Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, this new release would seem like a sure thing. But somebody misplaced the fun compass for Rugrats Go Wild. The trouble begins with a well-deserved PG rating. The ads call it mild, crude humor, but this has more yucks than yuks. There are a succession of loaded-diaper jokes, a huge snot bubble, bird poop in the face, vomiting and flatulence. When he meets a new character, Spike the dog (voiced by Bruce Willis) turns and says, Want to smell my butt? Now, somewhere on the Nickelodeon studio lot someone is saying, Kids love that kind of stuff. But only as a lowest common denominator. Finding Nemo, to which Rugrats Go Wild is fated to endure comparisons, makes better jokes, with more class and has a G rating to boot. Sadly, it also must be reported that the much-touted Odorama card creates barely a whiff of interest. The idea is that when numbers appear on the screen (and you'd better be paying attention, they are on and off quickly) you scratch your Odorama card and sniff the result. First, you have to really, really scratch hard to get a smell, and second, a lot of the smells are pretty similar -- even the stinky feet. Part of the problem is that by combining the entire Rugrats gang and the whole zoo from The Wild Thornberrys, both popular TV shows, you've got way too many characters. It doesn't help that most of the time is spent with the Rugrats babies although the Thornberrys are the more interesting family. Except for a ripping run through the jungle while the kids are being chased by a jaguar (Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, wasted in the part), this is flat, dreary going. The songs seem tacked on to the action and the filmmakers are so amused by their clever nods to Titanic, Gilligan's Island, I Love Lucy and The Perfect Storm that the plot lacks snap. The exception is Willis as Spike. He's got more energy than the rest of the cast combined. And his duet with Hynde, Big Bad Cat, is one of the only musical numbers that doesn't stop the action dead. A wise-cracking dog, now that's funny -- in case Nickelodeon needs a reminder. . This film contains gross-out humor. -- C.W. Nevius . The Eye has an interesting premise. It ought to, it has been used often enough. Once again a character has a Sixth Sense and can see dead people. And, you guessed it, no one believes them. The twist here is that the heroine Mun ( Lee Sin-Je) has gotten eye transplants to cure her blindness. Slowly -- really, really slowly -- she realizes that some of the visions she is seeing are channeled from the donor, a young, psychic girl who died tragically. It is pretty obvious what connection filmmakers Danny and Oxide Pang are hoping you will make. From the long, stringy hair hanging down in Mun's face to the black-and-white vignettes, this is an echo of the surprise hit shocker The Ring. Part of the strategy has already worked. Tom Cruise's production company has snapped up the rights for an English-language version. Just a piece of advice, Tom: Speed it up. It takes forever for Mun to figure out what is going on, and then she can't bring herself to do more than blink, gasp and gape. Lee is not an experienced actress, and it shows. Whoever gets the part in the English version had better work on her double takes. Unless the script gets some major revision, her major challenge is to be shocked, shocked at the sight of ghostly figures no one else can see. The Pang brothers, who are twins, got their start doing commercials in Thailand. Their gangster film Bangkok Dangerous created some buzz, but it is hard to believe this plodding, predictable snoozer will raise anyone's pulse rate. Plot threads are introduced and then dropped, Mun and her love interest Dr. Wah (Lawrence Chou) pop their eyes and look horrified, and everyone is way ahead of the surprise twists. In the final, slam-bang finish, Mun runs through the streets trying to warn the townsfolk of an impending disaster. But she pounds her fists on car windows to no avail. What is she saying? one driver asks. Hey buddy, you don't have to be a psychic to roll down the window. . This film contains violence, suicide and creepy characters. -- C.W. Nevius ",1
"'13 Ghosts' Horror. Starring Tony Shalhoub, F. Murray Abraham. Directed by Steve Beck. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Which probably would be a relief to the late shlockmeister William Castle, who made 13 Ghosts first in 1960. Though the remake isn't particularly scary, the premise is just silly enough and the set design just striking enough to keep it afloat. The star is a rather extraordinary haunted house, a modern marvel of glass walls, spinning floors and burnished metal doodads. It's not actually a house at all but a soul-sucking hell machine -- great architecture often requires trade-offs. A widower (Tony Shalhoub from Spy Kids and TV's Wings) and his kids inherit the place from a crazy uncle (F. Murray Abraham). They're soon trapped there with 12 angry ghosts, the souls of whom were plucked by the uncle. A family member is supposed to complete the baker's dozen. Each ghost has a shtick -- the Torso, the Hammer -- but their makeup jobs lend them all a gray, clumpy look, as if there have been no advancements in makeup since Night of the Living Dead. Only a computer-assisted maniac, vicious in a boxy muzzle, produces any real chills. How the characters fare against the monsters isn't the issue with a movie like this anyway; it's how the actors react to a silly story line. Abraham, digging in with Vincent Price gusto, and Matthew Lillard, grimacing maniacally as a psychic, embrace the spirit of the picture best. Shalhoub just looks hangdog and too serious. As Shalhoub's children, Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) and young Alec Roberts make a curious sibling pair. She looks too old to be the kid's sister or Shalhoub's daughter. But a quick shot of her shirt being shredded in the chest region lets us know why she's around. -- Carla Meyer Romance. Starring Julie Blake and Charles Tingwell. Directed by Paul Cox. (Not rated. 105 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) Fifty years ago, Andreas and Claire were beautiful young people having one of those love affairs that poetry and movies were made for. Director Paul Cox shows this affair in wordless flashbacks -- a bicycle ride here, some clothes coming off there, a radiant smile, a bottle of wine. The romance does seem like something that would haunt the memory. Now she's almost 70, and he's a bit older. Andreas (Charles Tingwell) writes to Claire (Julia Blake), and they meet for lunch having not seen each other for 50 years. He's a widower; she's married to a man who ignores her. So Andreas and Claire start an affair. An awareness of time and death hangs over all great romances. This awareness is yet more pronounced when the lovers are at this stage of life. Through montages that convey the characters' consciousness, we feel the lovers' bittersweet urgency. As played by Tingwell, Andreas is a romantic, in love with love, just as Claire's husband, John (Terry Norris), is a man who has been more comfortable living on the surface of his feelings. Only Claire seems to understand the everyday realness and hugeness of this affair. Blake, lovely to behold, is extraordinary. The bad news is that Cox, having presented a compelling situation, spins his wheels, drops the energy and starts indulging in sentiment, finally arriving at the easiest exit. But Innocence has bought so much audience good will in its first 70 minutes that the ending is more a missed opportunity than a fatal misdirection. -- Mick LaSalle Crime comedy. Starring Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack. Directed by Mel Smith. (R. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Driver plays a British nurse and McCormack a struggling American actress living in London. Listening to a cell-phone scanner belonging to Driver's ex- beau, they hear about a bank job in progress and decide to sweat the crooks for a share of the loot. But the women aren't dealing with guys who will roll over, and each new demand increases the likelihood the pair will be killed. Yet they persist in their scheme, even after an innocent man gets shot. Why? Actually, writers Kim Fuller and Georgia Pritchett try to establish their motivation, but it's just too sad and unbelievable. The characters convince themselves that since they are both single and relatively poor, they should give crime a try -- a dispiriting notion for a couple of beautiful women in their early 30s. If one ignores reason, High Heels hums along well enough as a crime caper, and McCormack and Driver are winning comic actresses. McCormack (Private Parts), especially, shines here as her character adopts a tough-guy East End accent and weighs how many F-words and slags are appropriate for a telephone threat. Like the designer suits Driver wears despite her character's meager earnings, High Heels and Low Lifes isn't about reality; it's playing dress- up. -- Carla Meyer Romantic comedy. Starring Lance Bass, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Joey Fatone. Directed by Eric Bross. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) On the Line is formulaic romantic comedy starring Lance Bass, of the pop group 'N Sync, as Kevin, a shy advertising man who meets a woman on the L train in Chicago. She likes him, but he fails to ask for her name or phone number. And so the next 95 minutes of screen time are taken up with him trying to find her. Bass is entirely believable as a retiring young fellow. The role might not call for much range, but Bass's essence is pleasant, and for a movie like this, that's 90 percent of the game. Joey Fatone, also of 'N Sync, plays his flatulent friend. His role doesn't call for much range, either. The real charmer is newcomer Emmanuelle Chriqui, a Canadian actress of French Moroccan descent, whose looks and intelligence make young Kevin's obsession understandable. The movie has some clumsy dialogue and awkward turns, but the picture is brisk and likable. Plus, there's Al Green. During the closing credits, he appears in a street-party setting, singing, Let's Stay Together. It's the best part of movie. -- Mick LaSalle Black comedy. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal. With Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze. Written and directed by Richard Kelly. (R. At Bay Area theaters. 113 minutes.) Donnie Darko (Gyllenhaal) is in therapy and probably overmedicated, but with Katharine Ross (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) as his shrink, you can't be too sure. Anyway, Donnie has an imaginary friend named Frank who looks like a rabbit and communicates with him from the other side of a watery plane. The movie, set during final month of the Dukakis-Bush campaign of 1988, is filled with established performers like Ross in supporting roles. Drew Barrymore is a cool English teacher, and Patrick Swayze an uncool TV motivational huckster. Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves) is Donnie's mother, who delivers the movie's best line. How does it feel to have a wacko for a son? Donnie asks. It feels wonderful, she replies. Another touching character is a crazy old lady who keeps going back to her mailbox looking for a letter that never arrives. Donnie Darko was written and directed by Richard Kelly, who impressed Barrymore enough to get her to produce it, and for the first hour, you can see why she went for it. The movie's got a wry point of view, even though it deals with the hallucinations of a paranoid schizophrenic. His conviction that the world is coming to an end appears to have merit. Writer-director Kelly has said that the film, shown at Sundance, needs to be seen several times. Good luck. -- Bob Graham Documentary. Starring Carole Baldwin and narrated by Kenneth Branagh. Directed by Al Giddings and David Clark. (Not rated. 45 minutes. At the Metreon.) Of all the 3-D IMAX films out there, Galapagos is probably the least upstaged by its filmic process. Shot as a regular movie, it would still have been a decent documentary. Shot as an IMAX movie, it's touched by a magic wand. It follows marine biologist Carole Baldwin as she explores caves, dives under water and boards a submersible in order to travel 3,000 feet to the ocean floor. Baldwin has the courage of a tiger. We see her in her wet suit, lying low while a swarm of hammerhead sharks swim by. In the submersible -- which she describes as yet more dangerous -- she discovers life forms that no human has ever seen. One undersea creature looks like billowing pink tissue paper. It's extraordinary. Galapagos is a visit to another world within our own, far away from human concerns. Just the sight of the iguanas -- armies of them -- blending into the rocks on a hot morning makes this a film worth seeing. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Lee Kang-Sheng. Directed by Tsai Ming-Liang. (Not rated. 115 minutes. In Mandarin with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) Taiwanese filmmaker Tsai Ming-Liang -- who explored similar territory in the Vive L'Amour and The Hole -- uses loneliness and alienation as the primary emotional colors on a surprisingly expressive canvas. Using no music, scant dialogue and not much action, Tsai views this broken family from three angles and employs the metaphor of a roof leak to represent the secrets that threaten their silence. The son (Lee Kang-Sheng) finds work playing a corpse in a movie, but after floating face down in a polluted river he comes down with a paralyzing shoulder and neck pain that won't go away. The parents search for a cure, and the father and son share a devastating surprise. Tsai is so adept at pacing and mood, and so good at capturing a sense of yearning, that his film draws us in despite its unusually long takes and sparse cutting. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"'A Love Divided' Drama. Starring Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and Tony Doyle. Directed by Sydney Macartney. (Not rated. 98 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) A Love Divided has the structure of that sort of movie. Yet it would be just as accurate to describe it as the tale of a neurotic who forces her emotional conflicts on the lives of her neighbors. The picture, based on a real incident, is set in an Irish village in the late 1950s. Sheila and Sean are a married couple with little girls. She's Protestant, he's Catholic, and the kids are being raised in the Catholic Church, the dominant religion in their area. Everything's great until the day comes when it's time for the oldest daughter to go to school. The local priest, Father Stafford (Tony Doyle), assumes that the daughter will go to the Catholic school. He's arrogant about it. Sheila doesn't seem to care what school the child goes to, but she doesn't like his attitude. She insists it's a decision that she and her husband should make on their own. From this simple contest of wills, a whole drama enfolds, escalating to the point that the Vatican in Rome eventually weighs in. Rather than let her Catholic daughter enroll in a Catholic school, Sheila breaks up her marriage and inflicts on her children an exhausting odyssey through Northern Ireland and Scotland. She's not a heroine. She's more interesting than that -- a self-possessed woman unwittingly in the midst of a prolonged nervous breakdown. Orla Brady plays Sheila with intensity and commitment, using the gaps in the script to fuel a sense of mystery. Brady is ably matched by Tony Doyle, who plays Father Stafford as the only person in the small town glowing with confidence. Stafford is sure of his authority, his rectitude and his judgment. Sheila envies Stafford's smugness enough to upend her life, just as Stafford fears that Sheila might undermine his grip on the community. On both sides, it's all about power, nothing to do with principle. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy-drama. Starring Denis Lavant and Chulpan Hamatova. Directed by Veit Helmer. (R. 86 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Tuvalu is a German film, but there are no subtitles, nor is there a need for them. The picture, aside from a few random words, is without dialogue, a silent film with musical accompaniment. Anyone who knows silent film -- indeed, anyone who sees the extended silent sequence in Ocean's Eleven -- can testify to the emotional power of images combined with music. But Tuvalu, an extended attempt to make a film of this kind, is a disappointment, a precious and grotesque exercise reminiscent of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Delicatessen, only less amusing. On the plus side, those who loved Delicatessen are likely to find Tuvalu interesting. The picture, shot in black and white and then tinted (a technique common in the early silent days), takes place at a broken-down public swimming pool. Denis Lavant plays Anton, the dutiful son of a blind lifeguard. Chulpan Hamatova is Eva, who involves herself with Anton in the hope of stealing a piston for a motorboat. She wants to go places. Along the way, the two seem to fall in love, smiling and acting fey. She undresses, and he spies on her from a hole in the floorboards. She doesn't mind. The villain of the piece is Anton's brother (Terrence Gillespie), who has hair like Lyle Lovett and a smile like Ray Davies. The brother wants to close down the bathhouse. Somehow this is considered a wicked ambition, even though the movie, in scene after scene, trades on the dilapidated condition of the place. The showers, toilets and dryers don't work, and there are few customers. Tuvalu is the sort of movie that would contain a running gag involving a middle-aged lady who likes to chew other people's chewing gum. Perhaps this is meant to be emblematic of the human condition: Some chew new gum; some chew old gum; some don't chew all. Perhaps it's meant to be ugly, and yet arouse a feeling of sympathy for striving, imperfect humanity. Or perhaps it's just meant to be amusing -- but no, that can't be. That's impossible. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Amargosa'  Documentary. Directed by Todd Robinson. (Not rated. 92 minutes. At Rafael Film Center.) Thin, graceful, wizened and disarmingly down to earth, Marta Becket is an inspiration. Amargosa treats her as such, catching her at work in the ornate Amargosa Opera House she pretty much restored single-handedly. Robinson's portrait is an affectionate look at a woman who faced her own destiny one day and refused to blink. She's out there, in the spiritual sense. But the film shows her as warmly human, not a desert kook. Becket was a successful Broadway dancer traveling cross country with her husband when their car broke down. They were near Death Valley Junction, on the site of an abandoned adobe hotel complex. The place, Amargosa, was once operated by Pacific Coast Borax Co. and had a small, crumbling theater. Becket decided on the spot that it was to be the home for her boundless creative energies. The forthright artist went on with what essentially was her own private show. She choreographed and performed her own dances, at first to an audience of tumbleweeds. But over the course of six years, she painstakingly developed another audience -- the Renaissance-looking crowd she painted in elaborate murals to fill her Amargosa Opera House with gawking spectators. Eventually Becket was discovered by living audiences, mostly appreciators of art, who have gone to great lengths to see her work. Among the trickle of admirers was writer Ray Bradbury, who's a fan. The film is an engaging testament to the pursuit of dreams. Becket overcame much and worked hard to get where she is today, a relatively unknown artist in the middle of nowhere. But she loves her unique place in the world. -- Peter Stack Documentary. Directed by Michael Apted. (Not rated. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture was directed by Michael Apted, who balances a career as a big- scale feature director (Coal Miner's Daughter, Gorky Park) with an equally distinguished career as a documentarian. His continuing Seven Up documentary series, following a group of British school children from ages 7 through 42, is a classic. Me & Isaac Newton introduces us to the seven scientists and then cuts from one to another, showing them at work. Apted's interest is twofold -- to show the various kinds of scientific inquiry at the turn of the millennium and to give us a glimpse of the scientist personality. The scientists Apted presents have the radiance of great artists, and in a sense they are artists. They are on fire with their ideas and wake up every morning curious. Science is truth, and truth is beautiful, says Gertrude Elion, a pharmaceutical researcher who won a Nobel Prize for her work in developing leukemia drugs. Elion died at 81, shortly after appearing in the film. The other scientists included are Ashok Gadgil, an environmental physicist; Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist; Maja Mataric, who works in robotics; Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist; Karol Sikora, a cancer researcher; and Patricia Wright, a primatologist. One could make a compelling documentary about each of them. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'An Unreasonable Man' Documentary. With Ralph Nader. Directed by Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan. (Not rated. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As it stands, when people think of Nader today, they think of the 90,000 votes Nader got and the 538 additional votes that Al Gore needed to become president of the United States. Some others think of the campaign trips Nader made to crucial swing states in the closing days of the 2000 campaign. The film attempts to broaden public perception and remind people that Nader's legacy also includes his successful David-and-Goliath struggle with the auto industry to make cars safer. Those who love Nader will appreciate the respect and attention given his career. Yet others, even those for whom the mere sight of Nader's face is enough to cause a spike in blood pressure, will appreciate the film's evenhanded elucidation of Nader's faults. Though filmmakers Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan clearly stand in awe of Nader's achievements, their film is not necessarily flattering to Nader as a man. He comes across as intelligent and dedicated and also messianic and self-righteous, incapable of believing he can be wrong about anything. And though his former colleagues insist that Nader has a marvelous sense of humor, this aspect has apparently eluded the camera for more than 40 years. The film features interviews with left-leaning writers such as Eric Alterman and Todd Gitlin, who hold Nader in absolute contempt as a delusional, destructive, intellectually dishonest egomaniac. The filmmakers interview others who are in-between -- former Nader's Raiders who are disappointed with Nader's effect on presidential politics. And it gives no more than equal time to unabashed Nader admirers, such as Phil Donahue. The movie allows all of them to make their points, without the intrusion of a narrator, and viewers have enough to make up their own mind. One thing everyone can agree on: Nader is an unreasonable man, in the sense that George Bernard Shaw described -- a man who persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Shaw wrote that all progress depends on the unreasonable man. That includes positive progress, like that made by individuals such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King, as well as the destructive political transformations by people such as Lenin and Stalin in the Russian Revolution. Thus, An Unreasonable Man is a title guaranteed to please everyone. About a third of the film is devoted to the 2000 race, with Nader's admirers and detractors -- and Nader himself -- getting a chance to have their say. As to the issue that Nader set out to spoil the election for Gore, the movie offers as definitive an analysis by Barry Burden, a Harvard professor, who studied Nader's 2000 post-Labor Day campaign schedule and concluded that Nader was merely trying to maximize his own vote. Yet deliberate or not, Nader, as Burden's study shows, actively campaigned and advertised in Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of which were razor-thin. Nader's efforts forced Gore to devote time and money to shoring up his base, rather than campaign in Tennessee and Arkansas -- red states that a Nader campaign veteran insists Gore should have won. Indeed. In this otherwise scrupulously fair account, there is one place in which the film becomes a bit disingenuous, and that's in its ever-so-slight suggestion that Democrats' anger at Nader was a purely after-the-fact phenomenon, a case of sour grapes. In fact, Democrats were begging Nader to drop out as late as October, or at least to tell his supporters in swing states to support Gore. Nader did not, but at least An Unreasonable Man is honest enough to show Nader gloating in the aftermath of the 2000 vote. I do think Al Gore cost me the election, especially in Florida, Nader jokes. I guess that's what Nader's admirers mean by his great sense of humor. -- Advisory: This film contains disturbing footage of election night 2000. -- Mick LaSalle 'Maxed Out' Documentary. Directed by James Scurlock. (Not rated. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Documentary filmmakers have become the muckrakers of the 21st century, splashing injustices all over the screen. Visualizing wrongdoings rather than merely writing about them can have enormous impact. An Inconvenient Truth has done more to call attention to global warming than hundreds of newspaper articles. In Maxed Out, director James Scurlock takes on credit debt. While the documentary does a credible job of pointing out the magnitude of the problem, it skirts the issue of what can be done about it and by whom. The unfortunate people spotlighted in the film who have been sucked into monetary ruin sign papers with information, albeit in fine print, about the exorbitant interest rates charged on outstanding debt. So is it the government's responsibility to protect these folks from themselves, and if so, how? Should Americans be taught in school how to handle their money? Would such courses stand us in better stead in the long run than Shakespeare or calculus? Maxed Out would have far more impact if the filmmaker had at least raised such questions -- even if he couldn't supply definitive answers. Scurlock's biggest revelation is that multiple credit cards are offered by reputable financial institutions (one of them has been a major contributor to George Bush's election campaigns). They operate like dirty old men luring the innocent with candy. Once people take the bait, they often wind up going way over the limit set for them. Their debt becomes so overwhelming that in some instances bankruptcy seems like the best solution or, in the saddest cases, suicide. You'd have to be pretty hard-hearted, or work for one of these financial institutions, to not be moved by interviews with the mothers of two college students who killed themselves after incurring enormous debt. Apparently credit cards are hawked on college campuses because young people are both susceptible to wanting more than their parents are willing to spring for and have almost no resources to pay their bills. A widow in Half Moon Bay heartbreakingly describes to Scurlock how she has been reduced to selling her collection of specialty plates, pointing to the holes on her wall where they once hung. Whatever she can get for them won't even come close to paying off the credit cards on which she owes an additional 29 percent interest. Looking directly into the camera, she reveals that she's considered killing herself, but I couldn't do that to my kids. This is powerful stuff, almost like looking at Dorothea Lange's photos of migrant farm families. But Scurlock dilutes stories of individual ruin by hauling in the huge national debt. His point seems to be that the federal government has set a bad example. But he can't possibly believe this has anything to do with why people use credit to live way beyond their means. The director attempts to enliven things by inserting peripherally related movie clips and a faux silent episode of somebody about to jump off a plank. But these only trivialize a very serious subject. If Maxed Out brings about any change at all it will be because of the response of audiences: You exit the theater inclined to burn all your credit cards. -- Ruthe Stein 'Shadow Company' Documentary. Directed by Nick Bicanic and Jason Bourque. (Not rated. 86 minutes. At the Roxie Film Center.) The use of mercenaries in warfare is as old as warfare itself, and yet the issues mercenaries present are new again, thanks to the U.S. government's employment of private military companies in the Iraq war. Shadow Company explores all sides of this practice, through interviews with ethicists, soldiers and the mercenaries themselves. The movie presents a balanced view, showing both the moral challenges and tactical advantages of using professional soldiers. Like most things, the issues are clear-cut only from a distance. While there are cowboys out there, there are also professionals who fight only for causes they believe in -- though for a price. (They don't believe in them enough to do it for free.) The use of mercenaries gives an unfair advantage to whichever adversary has the most cash. Yet the movie points to a couple of incidents in which mercenaries have served an arguably positive function. The term mercenary is, in itself, a loaded term. Most mercenaries don't think of themselves as being mercenary. They see themselves as soldiers or helicopter pilots whose special skills aren't particularly needed in the civilian world. Some genuinely enjoy combat, as well as hanging around with their fellows. The movie makes clear that some are fairly decent guys, but it makes equally clear that the system, as it currently exists, makes it very easy for rogues to go around killing people with impunity. The movie criticizes the fact that civilian safeguards on mercenary behavior are practically nonexistent, a state of affairs that can lead both to human rights abuses and to ill feeling toward the United States. Considering that an Iraqi doesn't care whether he's getting shot at by an American soldier or an American mercenary, it must be faced that these mercenaries are de facto ambassadors, and they need to be under responsible government control. Shadow Company makes a subtle case, that there may be a place for mercenaries on the U.S. payroll, but that every aspect of their employment -- including bidding for contracts -- needs to be handled better and more efficiently. -- Advisory: Adult themes, disturbing images. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Army of Shadows' 1969 drama. Starring Lino Ventura and Simone Signoret. Directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. (Not rated. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Army of Shadows deals with the French resistance during World War II, but it's nothing like any other French resistance film ever made. There's no romance and no thrilling escapes, and not a single character experiences a flicker of satisfaction at pursuing a just cause. Instead, life is grim and ugly, a succession of ambiguous victories, moral compromises and the constant threat of capture. If anything, the resistance members act as if they've all sold their souls to the devil and can't get them back. A telling moment comes early in the film, when Philippe (Lino Ventura), a resistance captain, and his associates capture a former member who has turned informant. They bring him back to an apartment to kill him, but there are too many people within earshot. So they gag him and proceed to discuss how to go about killing him silently. There's no doubt they'll go through with it, but there's equally no doubt that, in carrying out this order, they are killing a part of themselves -- and they know it. It's a scene even more effective and morally complicated than the killing of the Dutch spy in Munich. Further indication of Melville's specific and unique point of emphasis comes in yet another early scene, in which the hero escapes from Nazi headquarters. A typical filmmaker would have turned that into a moment of adventure, but Melville cuts off the scene early. His idea of drama has nothing to do with action as mere titillation. Thus, he focuses more on the scene that follows, a seemingly low-key interaction in which Philippe hopes to hide by going into a barbershop for a shave. Is the barber a collaborator? Will he turn him in? And what's the meaning of the political sign on the wall? Everything Melville shows us, he shows us for a reason, and these reasons are never obscure but are rather pertinent to the action and to the moral movement of the world and the characters. Perhaps in Melville's own time, his pictures were considered both too much like American films (crime films, thrillers, noirs) and yet not enough like them to please American audiences. But a generation later, there's no mistaking that he was a master. -- Advisory: The violence is not suitable for children. -- Mick LaSalle 'Autumn' Drama. Starring Laurent Lucas, Irène Jacob and Jean-Claude Dreyfus. Written and directed by Raup McGee. (In French with English subtitles. Not rated. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) From the multitude of pistols drawn in Autumn, the setting could be Deadwood instead of Paris. Thugs point guns at one another ad nauseam, and there's a climatic shootout across the tracks at a Metro stop. Talk about stopping traffic. For all the precision shooting, Autumn is a colossal misfire, a tedious film noir wannabe. It doesn't even qualify as film gris. You'll be searching for an exit long before a Sortie sign comes into view at the station. Writer-director Ra'up McGee attempts to create an air of mystery in his pretentious tale of a hit man, Jean-Pierre (Laurent Lucas), seeking redemption and another line of work. The real mystery is how McGee managed to entice Lucas (the hapless dad in With a Friend Like Harry) along with Irène Jacob (the title character in Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Double Life of Veronique) and Jean-Claude Dreyfus (the hulk from Delicatessen). French cinema must be experiencing a downswing. McGee, an American documentary filmmaker, learned French for his first dramatic feature -- not very well, judging from the finished product. Still, Autumn benefits from lines like Everyone has to go through what they have to go through, sounding ever so much better in French. The best way to view the movie is to ignore the subtitles. After wiping someone out, Jean-Pierre goes to a Parisian cafe and runs into a childhood friend, Michelle (Jacob). Through flashbacks, it's established that the two witnessed a brutal act in a park during one autumn of their youth. Somehow this traumatic event has driven him to murder for profit and her to sell explosives. Jean-Pierre and Michelle fall in love. We know this because they take Polaroids of each other grinning and because he breaks a leg of one of Michelle's clients (Dreyfus) for attempting to rape her. The lovebirds decide to go straight together. But then she steals a silver briefcase with contents worth a great deal to a mob kingpin, putting Jean-Pierre in a horrible spot. Lucas, who looks like a young Montgomery Clift, can be very intense, and he and Jacob do their best to breathe life into cardboard roles. They're occasionally worth watching. But the film is paced to put you to sleep. When it finally ends, it seems as if autumn must have arrived. -- Advisory: Gratuitous violence and disturbing sexual content. -- Ruthe Stein 'Lady Vengeance' Thriller. Starring Lee Young Ae, Choi Min Sik. Co-written and directed by Park Chan Wook. In Korean with subtitles. (R. 112 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Park Chan Wook is the Quentin Tarantino of South Korea -- an appellation underlined by the fact that Tarantino, as jury president of the Cannes Film Festival in 2004, pushed to give the great Oldboy the second-place prize behind Fahrenheit 911, thus making Park a bona fide superstar in the international film community. Oldboy was the second in Park's bizarre and curiously cathartic revenge trilogy, now complete with Lady Vengeance, which opens today (the lousy Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, which failed to take hold at festivals in 2002, was the first). Lady Vengeance may be the most palatable of the three, and certainly the most darkly comic. Powered by a glowering performance by actress Lee Young Ae, it is a walloping tale of a woman who completes a 13-year prison sentence for a kidnapping and murder she did not commit, and upon her release, heads straight for the guy who did do it. Geum-ja (Lee) confessed to the crime because the real culprit, her schoolteacher Baek (Oldboy star Choi Min Sik), who saw her through her teenage pregnancy, abducted her infant daughter and threatened to kill the child if she did not take the fall for him. Once in prison, Geum-ja formulates a complex plan for revenge but outwardly becomes a reformed angel in order to reduce her sentence for good behavior -- there are many comic moments where she helps her fellow prisoners, who, once on the outside, will assist her with her plan. She finds religion but spurns the creepily pure leader of her Christian fellowship group upon her release. She's an angel, all right -- an avenging one. Upon release, Geum-ja takes a job at a bakery, reconnects with her former inmates and goes on a mission to find her daughter. In the most hilarious twist to this film, Geum-ja finds her daughter, whom Baek gave up for adoption, in Australia, where her foster parents have renamed her Jenny. Geum-ja brings her back to Korea for a visit and discovers a deeper purpose for her revenge. The last half hour or so of Lady Vengeance is a strange, twisted ordeal of finding Baek, discovering that he has committed many crimes and deciding how best to mete out vigilante justice. Park, a visually gifted director whose films are brimming with ideas, apparently can never resist a chance to gross out an audience -- among the pleasures of Oldboy was the eating of a live octopus and the severing of a tongue. The torture scenes that close Lady Vengeance are strong stuff; one hopes an international observer was present on set to monitor violations of the Geneva Conventions. However, unlike the previous two installments, Lady Vengeance generates on odd feeling: hope. If Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance wondered how heretofore law-abiding citizens could be driven to do very bad things, and Oldboy investigated the personal price of pure revenge, Lady Vengeance is ultimately about redemption -- about growing as a person and changing past behavior. Besides, what other revenge tale ends with a pie in the face? -- Advisory: Violent and strongly suggestive. -- G. Allen Johnson ",1
"'Bon Voyage' Comedy/drama. Starring Isabelle Adjani, Gerard Depardieu, Virginie Ledoyen, Gregori Derangere and Peter Coyote. Directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau. (Not rated. 114 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) This feeling of nonstop movement is enhanced by a pulsing original score by Gabriel Yared, who does for Bon Voyage what Bernard Herrmann did for Hitchcock's movies. Yared finds a rhythm for the mayhem. Those of us reading subtitles rather than listening to the dialogue will be particularly aware of the precise way his background music complements the story. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau (Cyrano De Bergerac, The Horseman on the Roof) co-wrote the script and has gone out of his way to say it is complete fiction. But Rappeneau is an expert on this chaotic period and the dismal behavior of many of his compatriots, who were willing to sell out their country, preferring to think of it as compromise. The unsavory characters in Bon Voyage -- including the two-faced French cabinet minister Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu), the self-involved actress Viviane (Isabelle Adjani) and the opportunist journalist Alex (the Bay Area's own Peter Coyote, speaking flawless French) -- may be made up, but they surely had parallels running around France at the time. Rappeneau successfully maneuvers the high-wire act of keeping his movie light without ever making light of the dire situation. He accomplishes this by focusing on the harebrained Viviane, who sees everything in terms of how it will benefit her. Bon Voyage kicks off with her murdering a movie producer, one of many men she strings along as long as it suits her needs. She convinces another lover, Frederic (the appealing Gregori Derangere, a leading man in France who deserves recognition in this country), to dispose of the body. Soon she has involved Beaufort in the coverup, pulling him out of high-level meetings in which the French government is deciding whether to capitulate. Adjani's performance is deliberately melodramatic to illuminate the behavior of someone who no longer knows the difference between acting and real life. Viviane is given to hysterical fits to get others to do her dirty work. When she looks up from her crocodile tears to see the effect they are having, it reminded me of the famous scene in Klute when Jane Fonda's hooker checks her watch in the midst of a fake orgasm. Adjani's bad girl is offset by the good girl played by Virginie Ledoyen. She's an assistant to a French scientist trying to keep a component necessary to make an atomic bomb out of the hands of the Nazis. I did mention a lot happens in this movie, right? Ledoyen first appears in studious glasses with her hair tied back. Frederic can envision her beauty when she loses the glasses and loosens her locks. He soon finds himself torn between the two women, as if the forces of good and evil are fighting for his soul. All the soul searching in Bon Voyage is reminiscent of Casablanca. There are epiphanies like Rick's in which even the most selfish characters realize their problems don't amount to a hill a beans compared to the catastrophe of war. Rappeneau plays these moments for laughs. His impressive cast, especially Depardieu and Coyote, understand how to shift moods, milking comedy out of impending doom. Bon Voyage begins and ends in a theater where audiences are watching Viviane onscreen. It's a nice touch to remind us that movies have always offered escapism in bad times and good. Bon Voyage is in that tradition, a bit of fluff expertly made and a hoot to watch. -- Advisory: This film contains brief sexual situations and some gun shots.  Ruthe Stein Sex comedy. Starring Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant. Directed by Luke Greenfield. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters The rest are just details, which the movie fills in expertly with an exceptionally well-written script, full of unexpected turns and clever reversals, and a trio of deft actors in the principal roles -- Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant. Though the story is very reminiscent of Risky Business, The Girl Next Door is, if anything, coarser, sexier, wiser and funnier than the old Tom Cruise film. Hirsch plays Matthew, a scholastically compulsive high school senior who becomes acquainted with a blond beauty (Cuthbert) named Danielle, who moves in next door. From the beginning, Danielle challenges and needles Matthew into outrageous stunts, partly out of playful sadism, partly to free him from his shell, and partly just to see what the kid is made of. He passes the test one night, in a scene that culminates in one of the most imaginative and least perfunctory first-kiss scenes to come along in a while. It turns out that she's a porn star, trying to leave the life, even though she knows that the easier path would be to just break down and continue to make movies for Kelly, her phenomenally sleazy producer (Olyphant). Kelly is the movie's flashiest creation, a leering, magnetic, frightening, glad- handing, easily-amused, hyper-sensitive, utterly deceitful, maddeningly likable wild man. When Olyphant is on screen, there's the feeling that things might go anywhere. Hirsch is sensitive and funny as a high school kid for whom life's tensions are converging. Cuthbert plays what is essentially a romantic abstraction, but she's lovely and lends Danielle an aura of perceptive intelligence. Director Luke Greenfield shows considerable comic timing in his interspersing of fantasy sequences throughout the narrative. One thing must be noted: This film should not be confused with the 1998 documentary of the same name. It was also a good film and also about a porn star, but a real one. -- Advisory: Strong sexual content and drug use.  Mick LaSalle Documentary. Directed by George Hickenlooper. (Rated R. 94 minutes. At the Lumiere and Act theaters in Berkeley). When Rodney Bingenheimer was a teenager, his mother drove him from their home in Mountain View to actress Connie Stevens' house in Los Angeles, leaving him with his suitcase and her best wishes. The actress wasn't home, but the trip launched a singular career on the periphery of celebrity. The bouncy, informative and funny documentary Mayor of the Sunset Strip details the diminutive Bingenheimer's rise from Davy Jones' stand-in on The Monkees to consummate hanger-on to taste-making disc jockey on the rock station KROQ. Featuring interviews with musicians such as David Bowie and Coldplay's Chris Martin, both of whom benefited from Bingenheimer's support, Mayor captures a time when a super-fan could become a real player. What it never completely captures is Bingenheimer, to the DJ's credit. Through his unlikely mop of bangs and unwavering, shy smile, Bingenheimer informs filmmaker George Hickenlooper's camera that he doesn't want to be examined. He sees himself as a vehicle for introducing new music to the world and for obtaining autographs for his relatives. He brings a winning egalitarianism to his quest. The man who once hung out with Elvis and the Doors also befriended Kato Kaelin and a sad fellow who writes love songs about Jennifer Love Hewitt. Bingenheimer proudly points to an artifact in his memento-filled apartment: Look, that's me at Brooke Shields' birthday party. Hickenlooper's attempts to portray Bingenheimer as pathetic never wash. Testimony from an expert on fame obsession distracts from the fun of the rest of the film, and Hickenlooper's grilling of Bingenheimer's elderly, reserved father about the allure of celebrity is agonizing. Bingenheimer's late mother, a dynamo and autograph hound, is the film's most fascinating figure, but her influence on her son is barely explored. More compelling are the documentary's musical moments, which explain Bingenheimer's long fascination with the Sunset Strip scene. Seminal 1980s band X is seen in concert and Coldplay also lends tunes. From his reign as glam-rock impresario at his English Disco nightclub in the 1970s through his long tenure at KROQ, Bingenheimer has displayed a keen ear for hooks. As his one-time stalker Courtney Love notes in the documentary, Bingenheimer has always been about the music. Moving through the drug- and groupie-filled chumminess of the 1970s to the more corporate record business of today, Mayor presents a picture of paradise lost. As the once-outsider KROQ caters to a young demographic with bands such as Limp Bizkit and Korn, Bingenheimer's weekly show has been banished to the radio Siberia of the wee hours. In a rare display of emotion on camera, Bingenheimer seems wistful for the days when his imprimatur could make a band, and slightly regretful that his status as a radio DJ never let him share in the financial success of stars he helped create. But there's no gloom evident in hilarious interviews with scenesters from Bingenheimer's heyday. Groupie extraordinaire Pamela Des Barres and her singer husband Michael recall fondly how Bingenheimer roped off a VIP space at the tiny English Disco -- about two feet from the unwashed masses. Bingenheimer's admittedly debauched pal Kim Fowley, creator of the all-girl band the Runaways, laughs off Runaway Cherie Currie's assessment of him as a pervert: I was sexually abusive to the whole universe. I wouldn't limit it to just one person. These folks are removed enough to look at their pasts with a somewhat jaundiced eye. Not so Bingenheimer, who remains as amiable and discreet as he was when he drew music legends to his inner circle. Enthusiasm without irony is the key to his enduring charm. -- Advisory: This film contains raw language, drug references.  Ruthe Stein Drama Starring Don Cheadle, Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Lena Olin, Jena Malone, Michelle Williams and Martin Donovan. Written and directed by Matthew Ryan Hoge. (Rated R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The United States of Leland stars Kevin Spacey as a famous novelist. The film, as bad as its title, is so lacking in subtlety that his character is named Fitzgerald. The author, living in self-imposed exile in Europe, returns home after his son Leland, whom he has long neglected, stabs to death a retarded boy. When Leland's prison teacher sidles up to Fitzgerald in a bar and starts ladling out compliments, his writer's intuition tells him that the teacher has come not to praise him but because he's working on a book about Leland. And I'm chapter two, Fitzgerald barks at him. I'm thinking about writing a book, too. Mine will be called When Bad Movies Happen to Good People. Spacey would make a dandy second chapter about how his success in American Beauty led him to believe he should be in more movies about Life with a capital L. The United States of Leland is his latest annoyingly pompous film. Besides being puffed up with its importance, it's also inert and totally implausible -- one of those movies where nobody behaves in a way that seems remotely human. Leland blithely continues with his studies in prison as if he'd been transferred to another school while his parents largely ignore the horrendous nature of his crime. As producer as well as star, Spacey seems particularly to blame for this turkey. My intuition tells me he may have convinced some good actors to appear with him. The high-powered cast includes Ryan Gosling as Leland, Lena Olin as his mother and Don Cheadle as his instructor and Jena Malone and Michele Williams as the murder victim's sisters. But their talents are wasted in poorly developed roles. Only Martin Donovan, as the victim's father, manages to bring any humanity to the proceedings. Leland is penning a memoir called, predictably, The United States of Leland, which makes him the third writer or at least would-be writer in a movie obviously enraptured with the profession. I have made mistakes in my life but I sure got it right in my books, Fitzgerald boasts as if that's all that matters. It's ironic that a film with such reverence for the written word would be so poorly written. Not even the best director could have done anything with this script. But The United States of Leland didn't have the best director. The screenwriter directed it. To save him embarrassment, I won't mention his name, but it ain't Fitzgerald. -- Advisory: This film contains some brief sexual situations and violence.  Ruthe Stein Documentary by John Walter and Andrew Moore. Music by Max Roach. (Unrated. 89 minutes. At the Roxie Theater) Opening with aerial shots of the Long Island waters in which Johnson drowned, How to Draw a Bunny begins with the question of Johnson's suicide and ends by suggesting that he planned his death as a performance culminating his work. The filmmakers talk with Johnson familiars including Warhol Factory regular Billy Name, artists James Rosenquist, Chuck Close, Christo and Jeanne- Claude and dealer Richard Feigen.The camera, static on a tripod, sees them all in black and white. Johnson's own work and the scene-setting of the mystery get much of the color. The film's title refers to the simple but nearly inimitablefigure -- a button-eyed face with rabbity ears and matching pendulous nose - that Johnson drew on collages, letters and wherever a portrait, a signature or even a place- holder was wanted. Judith Malina reads from Johnson's letters on the film's soundtrack, but not enough to show why people treasure his correspondence like family heirlooms. Like most art documentaries, How to Draw a Bunny founders on the problem of how to represent the artist's work. Johnson poses special problems to the documentarian, for no single thing he made looks like much. Cumulatively his collages, letters and performances -- and his legend -- compose a self-portrait of striking wryness and complexity. How to Draw Bunny won the Special Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, which must go to show how scarce noteworthy documentaries are. Kenneth Baker ",1
"'Brooklyn Rules' Drama. Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Scott Caan, Jerry Ferrara and Alec Baldwin. Directed by Michael Corrente. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Capturing Manhattan's essence is easy. But capturing life inside provincial New York City -- that is, the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island -- is something that eludes most filmmakers. They get the accents wrong. They condescend to the characters. Even when they get the accents right, they get the attitude wrong. Scorsese, of course, knows this turf, and so does Edward Burns. And now add Brooklyn Rules to the short list of movies that get it right. The more you know, the more you'll appreciate Brooklyn Rules. For example, take this early scene, in which the neighborhood mafia captain -- perfectly played by Alec Baldwin -- takes a liking to a little boy and asks his name. Carmine Mancuso, the kid answers. To which the mobster replies, Is your mother Italian? An outsider watching that scene might be puzzled by the mobster's response. If his name is Mancuso, his father is Italian, so why mention the mother? The movie never explains his reason, but here it is: He wants to know if the kid is 100 percent Italian. If he is, he might have a mafia career someday. If he isn't, he can never become a made guy. Directed by Michael Corrente and written by longtime Sopranos writer Terence Winter, Brooklyn Rules tells the story of three pals in their early 20s, living in Bay Ridge in 1985. Why 1985? Again, the movie leaves it to the audience to figure out. But setting a movie in Bay Ridge, 1985, is a little like setting a movie in the United States in 1963. Everyone knows the earth-shaking event that happened later that year. In 1963, it was the JFK assassination. And in 1985 -- on Dec. 16, 1985, to be exact -- Gambino family boss Paul Castellano was gunned down by John Gotti's men outside a steakhouse. Brooklyn Rules is not about the mob war that followed. Throughout, the perspective remains that of three young men, who happen to have grown up in an Italian American neighborhood. Only one of them, Carmine (Scott Caan), is mob connected at all, and even then, only in a minor way. Michael (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is going to Columbia and taking pre-law classes, and Bobby (Jerry Ferrara) is studying for the post office test. Yet, the mob ethos is everywhere: in the men's understanding of masculinity, in their conception of fair play and in their approach to getting on in the world. And when the gang war starts, the reverberations have an impact on their lives. Michael is the protagonist, but the picture juggles the stories of all three guys, and that leads to some clumsy storytelling here and there, though for no more than a minute or two at a time. In all the important ways, the movie succeeds. It never leaves us in doubt that these guys are friends, or that they're from Brooklyn. It's not just that they pronounce words with a Brooklyn inflection. More significantly, they find that odd combination of naivete and aggression, of hostility and diffidence, that's at the root of (and informs) the Brooklyn way of talking. Prinze, who starred in every bad teen comedy at the start of his career, finally gets a role to live up to, and he does that and more. He plays especially well off of Caan, who for the first time demonstrates a charismatic and commanding presence. As the mob captain, Baldwin makes the right choices. He knows better not to play up being scary. Everybody else is scared of him -- and that makes him scary. Most people don't know what it's like to sit in a bar and have a local mobster walk in. Here's what happens. People don't get excited. They get terrified. They look down at their drinks and don't look up, afraid to make eye contact. They start calculating what might be a safe interval after which it would be OK to leave. They know if they offend the guy -- even by accident -- they'll end up sleeping with the fishes. Winter knows exactly what that's like. That mood and point of view are all over Brooklyn Rules -- an entertaining film that's true to its world. -- Advisory: Violence and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle 'Ten Canoes' Drama. Starring Peter Minygululu, Jamie Gulpilil and David Gulpilil. Directed by Rolf de Heer. (In Ganalbingu with English subtitles and in English. Not rated 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Americans' familiarity with Aboriginal culture is mostly limited to its so-called dream paintings. Ten Canoes, which won the Australian Academy Award for best film, offers another way into these complex indigenous people, through storytelling as haunting as their artwork. This highly unusual and captivating movie unfolds in two different time frames -- one a thousand years ago and the other further back still. It sounds confusing, especially because the same actor appears in both segments; but you always know where you are because the first story is shot in black and white, the far older one in vibrant color. There's a moral message -- a variation on the ninth commandment tweaked to thou shall not covet thy brother's wife. But so much else is going on that Ten Canoes never feels preachy. And there's an odd comfort in the realization that people have had lust in their heart for as long as they've been around. While a narrator keeps reminding us in English (used in combination with subtitled translations of Ganalbingu, an indigenous language) that this is our story not your story the feelings and jealously portrayed will seem familiar, giving Ten Canoes a universal appeal. In opening scenes, tribal men gather bark to make canoes so they can go off on a seasonal goose-egg hunt. Group leader Minygululu (Peter Minygululu, an artist who, like many in the cast, is making his acting debut) becomes aware that his much younger bachelor brother, Dayindi (Jamie Gulpilil), has become enamored with Minygululu's third, and most attractive, wife. Instead of forbidding a liaison, he tells his young sibling an ancient story about a man with three wives and a brother who is sexually attracted to one of them. The English narration is done by David Gulpilil, who played the lead in Walkabout, and his son, Jamie Gulpilil, appears as both young men. He makes their longing for the forbidden palpable. The tale unfolds in installments -- a sort of As the Ancient World Turns -- continuing through the entire process of the canoemaking and hunt. The audience is drawn in by this film within the film, which entices with scenes of sorcery and revenge. Australian writer-director Rolf de Heer is an extremely visual filmmaker, and his images stay with you. Ten Canoes'  authenticity is guaranteed by a close collaboration with the Aboriginal community. I can't remember a canoeist ever being listed on film credits before. -- Advisory: Some sexuality. -- Ruthe Stein 'Vitus' Drama. Starring Teo Gheorghiu, Bruno Ganz and Fabrizio Borsani. Directed by Fredi Murer. In Swiss German with English subtitles and in English. (PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Are all child prodigies insufferable, unhinged or diabolical? It sometimes seems so from their portrayals in Amadeus, Shine and The Omen, and that's just the short list. The Swiss film Vitus takes a different tack. Its title character is a prodigy who grows to resent his genius genes and yearns to be normal. Arriving in this country with a PG rating and the label family drama, Vitus is likable enough and definitely suitable entertainment for young people willing to read subtitles. But director Fredi Murer strains too hard for it to be something more, a magical opus about childhood and taking flight, in this instance literally and figuratively. You wind up feeling manipulated instead of emotionally moved. At age 6, Vitus (Fabrizio Borsani) is discovered to have a preternatural ability at the piano -- he plays Schumann as if it were Chopsticks -- and can run rings around his fellow kindergarteners. Hearing about global warning, he lectures them on the dangers, sounding like a pint-size Al Gore. These early scenes are the best because of Borsani. He's that rare child actor who's adorable without being ingratiating. He never seems to be playing to the camera. So Vitus wins you over even at his most obnoxious. The only person he doesn't feel a need to show off for is his free-spirited grandfather (the versatile Bruno Ganz, a chilling Hitler in Downfall). Together, they fantasize about becoming pilots. The film becomes far less interesting when Teo Gheorghiu steps into the role of an adolescent Vitus. A real-life piano prodigy, he dazzles at the ivories but is stiff when called upon to emote. The script becomes increasingly less plausible. Vitus is not revealed to be the Antichrist but something nearly as silly. -- Ruthe Stein ",1
"'Company Man' Comedy. Starring Douglas McGrath, Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro. Written and directed by McGrath and Peter Askew. (PG-13. 81 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Imagine the cast, side by side, under the unflattering light of a police lineup: Sigourney Weaver, Alan Cumming, John Turturro, Heather Matarazzo, Ryan Phillippe, Denis Leary, Anthony LaPaglia, Woody Allen. Writer-directors Peter Askew and Doug McGrath go looking for an early-Allen redux and come up with an 81-minute crime scene, with McGrath as an unusual suspect. He plays Allen Quimp, a Greenwich, Conn., grammar teacher in the early '60s, who impersonates a CIA operative to impress his deeply unimpressible family. After inadvertently helping a miserable Russian dancer (Phillippe) defect, the CIA ships the prim, hapless Quimp to Cuba, where he inadvertently winds up embroiled in a scheme to assassinate Fidel Castro (LaPaglia). McGrath and Askew probably imagined this coming off like Bananas as filtered through James Thurber -- genial, fevered and lewd. It plays more like something moldering in the attic of Pee-wee's Playhouse, thanks in part to the cast's Raffi-esque rock-out to Old McDonald. Turturro is so amped he's almost foaming at the mouth. Playing a nut-job counterrevolutionary, it's the most embarrassing fun he's had since Brain Donors. With a retreating hairline and an archer-than-thou tone, McGrath makes a distracting Kevin Spacey surrogate -- only less creepy. Knowing that McGrath also directed Gwyneth Paltrow's effervescent coming-out party, Emma, and helped Woody Allen put the bile in Bullets Over Broadway only makes Company Man hurt more. Incidentally, this Allen-salute business is difficult. Todd Solondz (Fear, Anxiety & Depression) tried, so did Stanley Tucci with The Impostors. And Allen himself even gave it a whack with Small Time Crooks. Allen's part in Company Man might be Bananas'  Fielding Mellish plus 30 years. Here, he's having a blast and he doesn't even care that it's in the low-down dirtiest of shames. -- Wesley Morris Romantic comedy. Starring Peter McDonald and Flora Montgomery. Directed by Kieron J. Walsh. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere.) When Brendan Met Trudy is an Irish film -- but don't stop reading. It's not about the IRA. It's not about the troubles, and it's not a tender child- hood recollection of growing up in squalor. It is, of all things, a romantic comedy from a charming new director, Kieron Walsh, working from a screenplay by Roddy Doyle, the author of The Commitments. It's a winning little movie about two people who get together, though they have no business getting together. Peter McDonald plays Brendan, a pleasant-looking fellow who doesn't have much life force. He wears a suit. He sings in the choir. He's a sweet guy, but kind of dull, and then he goes to a pub and meets Trudy. Trudy is a modern-day take on a screwball comedy heroine: sexy, half-mad, impulsive and a little dangerous. She is also, we soon find out, a criminal, but then nobody's perfect. Newcomer Flora Montgomery plays her with radiance and spontaneity. Montgomery is a genuine find, and McDonald, in the much less flashy role of Brendan, isn't bad, either. A source for running gags is Brendan's obsession with Hollywood movies. The opening is straight out of Sunset Boulevard, and other references are sprinkled throughout the movie. The most sophisticated among them is a visual allusion to John Ford's The Searchers, though the director kills some of the fun by showing us the actual scene from The Searchers minutes before, lest we miss the reference. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Crazy Love' Documentary. Directed by Dan Klores. Codirected by Fisher Stevens. (PG-13. 92 minutes. At the Embarcadero Center Cinema.) The Jewish couple from the Bronx first came to the nation's attention during the summer of 1959, when Pugach, a 32-year-old married lawyer, hired two men to throw lye in the face of his 20-year-old girlfriend, Linda Riss, who had become engaged to another man. If I can't have her nobody can, was Burt's explanation for the crime of passion that blinded his girlfriend, put him in jail for 14 years and made him a tabloid star. The documentary opens with Linda, now 68, and Burt, now 79, describing their first impressions of each other. She was impressed with his money. He was crazy about her looks. They went clubbing (at his star-studded nightclub), driving (in his Cadillac convertible) and flying (in his personal plane). But she soon found out he was married, and dumped him, turning Pugach into an obsessive stalker. A chorus of Linda's girlfriends, also now in their late 60s, provides a funny but overlong summary of the couple's glamorous courtship and eventual blowup. Burt was not a very good-looking man, but he was a lot of fun, says one in a strong Bronx accent. She was always beautiful. Her skin was absolutely without a flaw, says another. Some say she was a tease, relates a third. These interviews -- along with ones with Burt's friends, his former secretary and tabloid journalist Jimmy Breslin, who followed Pugach's trial -- give Crazy Love its kitschy, wacky, distinctive tone. The movie is as much about the Pugaches as it is about their talent (and their friends' talent) for doing shtick. And Klores gets good performances. Crazy Love also captures the vibrant hustle of 1950s New York. Much screen time is given over to black-and-white photos of Linda mugging like a movie star, footage of the bustling streets and crowded buildings the two haunted, and the front-page stories from the New York Post and New York Mirror with blaring, all-cap headlines like Acid Thrower Blinds Girl. But the film bogs down at points, making one wonder: Why care about these two nutballs? Do we really need another voyeuristic study of the sad and dysfunctional? Fortunately, the film's third act delivers. After Burt survives years in jail and Linda endures mounting loneliness and impoverishment, their friends propose a reunion during which Burt proposes marriage to Linda. Within days, the couple are back together. The Pugach story has been dissected before -- in articles, books and on TV, where Burt and Linda made appearances throughout the 1970s and '80s to talk about their bizarre love affair. Klores and co-director Fisher Stevens' contribution is in filming their recent years, as the two old-timers bicker over lunch in a Bronx diner and amble back to the car wearing matching white furs. For better or worse, the message is that the Pugaches were fated to be together. Linda, blinded by Burt, has made Burt pay by turning him into her protector, her cash dispenser and her eyes, and Burt almost seems to like it that way. -- Tamara Straus 'ShowBusiness: The Road to Broadway' Documentary. Directed by Dori Berinstein. (PG. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Putting up a show in New York is one of the most stressful, potentially rewarding and potentially humiliating experiences imaginable, and the documentary ShowBusiness: The Road to Broadway captures the flavor of it. It goes behind the scenes of several Broadway musicals, which premiered during the 2003-04 season, showing the art and the politics, but also the atmosphere of Broadway, the rather singular feeling that takes over a company as it goes through previews and hurtles toward opening night. The feeling is hard to describe, but ShowBusiness gets it: the terror, the insularity and the exhilaration. In the weeks before opening, a show becomes its own world. People working on it do nothing but live inside it, rehearsing by day and performing by night, recalibrating the show in the hours between a preview's end and the start of the next morning's rehearsals. Within such an enclosure, both intense affections and resentments are likely to bloom. Everyone is exhausted. Everyone is scared. Everyone is ambitious, and the possible outcomes range from overnight success to career-destroying disgrace. And it all comes down to one show on one night, in which every participant has to be great, or else the whole thing collapses. ShowBusiness follows the cast, the creators and the producers of Wicked, Avenue Q, Taboo and Caroline, or Change, as they go through the process of mounting a Broadway show. It also demonstrates the impact and the surprising lack of impact that critics can sometimes have. Wicked got so-so reviews but is still running three years later, while Taboo, the Boy George musical, died after 50 or so performances. The artists are interviewed, while some of the critics are shown in the somewhat artificial situation of having dinner with each other. (Ben Brantley of the New York Times is interviewed separately.) The movie checks in with the critics periodically, as they assess the season. At first, there's speculation as to whether Avenue Q will find an audience. But the critical response is enthusiastic, and its audience -- mostly young or at least youngish -- finds it. The cameras are invited in to watch Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori work out the epilogue for Caroline, or Change, and on the day the cameras visit, the magic isn't coming. Along the way, the film includes insightful observations about the creative process, including one particularly acute one by Caroline director George Wolfe: He says that getting a show from good to very good is easy, requiring broad strokes of inspiration, but that getting a show from very good to brilliant takes meticulous work on hundreds of tiny details. -- Advisory: Mild, untoward language. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Dark Blue World' Drama. Starring Ondrej Vetchy and Tara Fitzgerald. Directed by Jan Sverak. (Rated R. In Czech and English, with English subtitles. 119 minutes.) The streak of cuteness and sentimentality that runs through this Czech film can't bring it down, even if it does compromise the emotional impact of this otherwise heroic tale of Czech fighter pilots in the RAF. The immediacy of the dogfights, shown from the point of view of the Czech airmen who went to England after Hitler's invasion of their homeland, should be sufficient for many moviegoers. The film was created by the father-and-son team of writer Zdenek and director Jan Sverak, who made Kolya, the 1997 Academy Award winner for foreign film. To say that Dark Blue World is thoroughly competent is not intended as a backhanded compliment. The sky, so to speak, is the limit, that's all. Two of the Czech pilots, mentor and protege, also become involved with the same Englishwoman, whose husband is missing in action. The story is told in flashback from 1950, after some of the surviving pilots had been thrown into labor camps by the new Czech regime. First the Nazis, then the Communists. Ontrej Vetchy, appropriately cleft-chinned, plays veteran pilot Franta, and Krystof Hadek is the fresh-faced, teenage trainee. He's a trainee in lovemaking, too, the training provided with a combination of hesitancy and curiosity by Susan (Tara Fitzgerald), a nanny for some children evacuated to the English countryside during the Blitz. Fitzgerald starred in the 1996 English comedy Brassed Off. Some of the aerial battle footage comes from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain. In at least one instance, when a plane is hit and the torn-apart chunks of fuselage seem to hesitate in the air before falling, it is oddly beautiful. -- Bob Graham Psychological horror. Starring Radha Mitchell, Justin Lewis, Catherine Lloyd Burns and Megan Mullally. Directed by Marc Forster. (Not rated. 89 minutes. At the Lumiere.) So begins Everything Put Together, a tale of yuppie conformity and domestic angst that quickly turns into a horror film. Finished in 1999, it was director Marc Forster's last feature before he made Monster's Ball, the acclaimed interracial drama that opens here Jan. 25. Shot on digital video, with more than passing references to Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion, Forster's low-budget drama is a study in paranoia and warped perception -- a look at a woman in her 20s, betrayed by her body and her friends, who falls off the edge. Forster maximizes the portability and intimacy of digital video, using camera to suggest Angie's frail and warped perspective. As she slides further into madness, the compositions get tighter, more claustrophobic: when Angie visits a storage facility to reclaim her baby furniture, the place becomes a hellish maze of numbered doors and shrinking corridors. The subject matter is queasy, but Radha Mitchell, who played Ally Sheedy's young lover in High Art, is pitch perfect as Angie. So are Megan Mullally (Karen on Will and Grace) and Catherine Lloyd Burns (Malcolm in the Middle) as her fair-weather friends -- pregnant Stepford moms who turn cold and remote when one of their own fails to realize her biological destiny. -- Edward Guthmann Comedy. Starring Veronika Zilkova and Jan Hartl. Directed by Jan Svankmajer. (Not rated. 127 minutes. In Czech with English subtitles. At the Red Vic.) Bozena (Veronika Zilkova) and Karel (Jan Hartl), a married couple, find out they are incapable of having children. Forlorn about this, they look with envy at every pregnant woman, until one day Karel takes a tree stump and fashions it into the shape of a child. He brings it to Bozena, and something in her snaps. She believes the stump is a baby. A movie about an unbalanced woman's delusion turns into a bizarre fantasy when the stump comes to life -- and it transforms further still into a horror movie, as the stump grows to tree size and starts devouring human beings. The mother, of course, sympathizes with her child and does her best to cover up the crimes. Svankmajer is a perceptive satirist. The yuppie vanity at the heart of the modern cult of babyhood is examined with amused fascination. Svankmajer's mastery of stop-action animation comes into play in the last half of the picture, as Otik grows and waves his branches. But 127 minutes is a lot of time for a simple movie with one satirical point to make and one animated character to show. At 80 minutes, this might have been a delight. At more than two hours, it's so much of a good thing that it starts to become a bad thing. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Day Watch' Science-fiction thriller. Starring Konstantin Khabensky, Mariya Poroshina and Vladimir Menshov. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. (R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) While the sequel to Night Watch is an imperfect film, it's always interesting, in the same way that Terry Gilliam's films used to be in the 1980s and 1990s, and Hayao Miyazaki's animated pictures still are today. The plot falls somewhere between The Matrix and Underworld films, but the art direction is original, with an explosion of fashions, gimmicks and visual effects that border at times on campy while somehow fitting within the action film narrative. Night Watch and Day Watch are reportedly two of the most expensive films ever made in Russia, even though their budgets seem middle of the road in American studio terms. The quality and quantity of special effects are approximately equivalent to something like Hellboy or one of the later Blade movies. That's probably a blessing, because it allows Bekmambetov to focus on the characters, starting with Anton (Konstantin Khabensky), a Night Watch agent who tries to keep the peace in a centuries-old underground cold war between an assortment of good and evil vampires, witches, warlocks and other superpowered humans. Anton's trainee and love interest Svetlana (Mariya Poroshina) is an inexperienced but powerful force of good, while his son Yegor is sort of a young Darth Vader for the bad guys. An inevitable clash between the two -- with Anton stuck in the middle -- could send both sides into a bloody war. There are 20 or 30 additional plot points, making Day Watch more of a film for the Highlander science-fiction geek crowd. The movie is reasonably easy to follow (especially if you've seen Night Watch) but it's not going to be a huge crowd-pleaser beyond art-house audiences. The dialogue is often clunky, and there appears to be a lot of inside jokes that don't make much sense if you haven't spent more than 10 years living in Russia. But Bekmambetov and his crafty cinematographer Sergei Trofimov have so many different tricks that you'll be smiling at the scenes that make no sense. Even the subtitles have a unique style, fading in and out, pulsating or splattering against a wall like little red water balloons. You won't be seeing that in Live Free or Die Hard this summer. -- Advisory: This film contains adult language, violence and sexual situations, including two characters who make love in a moving automobile -- which you should not try on your own, unless you're Tommy and Pamela Anderson Lee, who actually drive safer that way. -- Peter Hartlaub 'Bamako' Drama. Starring Aïssa Maïga and Tiécoura Traoré. Directed by Abderrahmane Sissako. (In French and Bambara, with English subtitles. Not rated. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Much of Bamako is set in the fly-ridden courtyard of a residential building in Mali, where a mock trial is being conducted by lawyers and judges in formal robes to decide the responsibility of the World Bank and other Western institutions for Africa's impoverishment. Trial movies can be painful, but Bamako is a powerful polemic leavened with moments of beauty and humor. Director Abderrahmane Sissako opens the proceedings by intercutting scenes from the lives of those living in and around the building, particularly a young singer (Aïssa Maïga) who is having trouble with her husband. There are shots of an ailing man lying in bed, of female workers dying fabric and of a wedding party that marches through the courtyard. Repeated sequences focus on a court guard who takes his duties very seriously. The lives of those affected by the issues formally examined by the court go on right beneath the noses of the bewigged debaters. In fact, the trial turns out to be pretty one-sided: the International Monetary Fund and other creditor groups take a serious verbal beating. Some of the best scenes involve fiery oratory on the part of attorneys and witnesses, both black and white, denouncing those they hold accountable for poverty and suffering on a wide scale. Particularly impressive are speeches by Aïssata Tall Sall and William Bourdon as advocates for the plaintiffs, and a long harangue that isn't even subtitled -- the intensity of the speaker's delivery tells us all we need to know. Sissako provides humorous, surreal commentary on his theme by including a short film-within-a-film, an African spaghetti Western called Death in Timbukto that features Danny Glover (one of Bamako's executive producers). But the comic mood ends when we see that this bloody shoot-'em-up draws laughs from its African viewers. It's a chilling touch, as is the remark by a character who is a cameraman and recounts that he prefers to shoot pictures of corpses, because they are more real than the living. -- Walter Addiego 'Angel-A' Fantasy romance. Starring Jamel Debbouze and Rie Rasmussen. Directed by Luc Besson. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The challenge of describing Angel-A is to make it not sound like a cliche. A lot of its individual elements are pretty time-honored, yet the overall experience of the movie is of something fresh. And while it inhabits a pretty rough world, of Parisian gangsters and loan sharks, the film has a warm spirit. This latest from Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Professional) tells a small-scale story about a Moroccan American hustler in Paris, Andre (Jamel Debbouze), who is trying to stay ahead of the mob while pursuing a number of business interests. He is a loser, a scruffy-looking fast-talker in rumpled clothes who, at the start of the movie, seems destined to end up on the inside of a chalk outline. Soon: Two mobsters want their money, by midnight, to the tune of tens of thousands of euros, and he has neither cab fare nor friend who can hide him. Weighing his options, he decides to throw himself into a river, but just as he's about to take the plunge, he sees a woman standing on the same bridge. She does jump, and he jumps in to rescue her. Angela is a tall, thin, bleached blonde in a miniskirt who could easily be a prostitute. In appreciation for his rescuing her, she attaches herself to him and makes it her business to help solve his problems. Despite the film's stylishness and the many changes in location, much of Angel-A consists of two-person conversations between Andre and Angela, and because Andre is a frustrated, combustible and loquacious character, much of it is simply bickering. In fact, there's too much bickering, though this problem clears up about midway. The kick of Angel-A is in seeing the various ways Angela goes about extricating Andre from his difficulties. Everything he tries is wrong -- he's a transparent but compulsive liar -- but everything she suggests is uncannily right. Their interaction and the performances deepen. Angela's mission is to reveal Andre to himself, to allow him to overcome the self-hatred that has trapped him in this marginal existence. There's a terrific moment in which they stand in front of a mirror and Angela forces him to look at and accept himself. To describe it, it seems like nothing. But the actors bring such conviction and sincerity to the moment that it becomes the locus of meaning for a film that's all about second chances. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language, sexual situations and violence. -- Mick LaSalle 'Steel City' Drama. Starring John Heard, Thomas Guiry and America Ferrera. Directed by Brian Jun. (R. 95 Minutes. Landmarks Opera Plaza Cinema, San Francisco.) Steel City makes a valiant attempt to add some new tweaks to the genre best described as life-sucks-growing-up-in-a-mill-town. At the start of these odes to our blue-collared young men (All the Right Moves and October Sky come to mind), our protagonist is usually faced with an unwanted choice: Stay in town and end up like the ol' man, or take a chance and run. In writer and director Brian Jun's film, the story isn't set up so neatly, and, at first, the ambiguity builds tension. PJ Lee (Thomas Guiry) is trying to hold his family together while Dad (a hellish-looking John Heard, long past his Home Alone days) is in jail on a murder charge, Mom is one step closer to the looney bin, and older brother Ben is still making the rounds like a punk in high school. When the water and electricity get turned off at home, we know it's on PJ to come through. Jun, who returned to his hometown of Alton, Ill., to shoot the film, shows a knack for dredging the hopelessness of small-town Middle America, and it's easy to see why the film was well received by the artsy crowds at Sundance. The cinematography is, at times, edited to a book of photographs: wide scenery shots on the range, cut to a close-up of PJ's bruised face, cut to Ben working in the mill, cut to Dad worrying about his boys. But the pacing -- some might call it subtle -- slows to a halt by the one hour mark, and, by then, it's a lot to ask a viewer to keep rooting for PJ, even if we are well trained to do so. Guiry does his best to help us along. The young actor, memorable for his intensity in Mystic River as a Southie trying to flee Boston with his girlfriend, gets saddled with a script that bogs him down in exposition. His performance isn't enough to make us feel the rush that comes when we realize the dude has made his choice -- the right one. -- Advisory: This film contains adult language and minimal nudity. -- Justin Berton ",1
"'Dead or Alive'  Thriller. Starring Riki Takeuchi and Show Aikawa. Directed by Takashi Miike. (Not rated but no one younger than 17 allowed. In Japanese with English subtitles. At the 4 Star.) At the 4 Star theater's Asian Film Festival showing that I attended, only two people did. One of the festival's discoveries, Dead or Alive is back for an open-ended run. Fasten your seat belts. There's a figure of a woman plunging from a high-rise into the street, a running snort of a long line of coke, men's room sex, a slashing, a nightclub shootout and a wigged-out knife-throwing act -- and that's just the first five minutes. The ending, almost 100 minutes later, is so outrageous there's nothing left for the audience to do but howl. In between these two surreal showpieces is a sordid cop drama, filmed in real streets but populated with characters who have unexpected sides. Lately, I've begun to feel this electricity from deep space, one of them says. A plainclothes cop leaps into the maelstrom. You're lucky there's so much happening, says an older cop who cannot get in on the action. The plainclothesman is played, with the effortless, unexaggerated masculinity of a Japanese Bogart, by Show Aikawa. Exaggerated is exactly what his antagonist is, a yakuza boss with Chinese gang connections, played less adroitly by Riki Takeuchi in pompadour and full- length duster. Before it is over, there will be a massacre amid flying chicken feathers and a deep-fried hand. This is no-holds-barred filmmaking. Some viewers will find it disgusting. Others will call the director's bluff. -- Bob Graham Drama. Starring Maud Forget, Lou Doillon and Robinson Stevenin. Directed by Jean-Pierre Ameris. (Not rated. 98 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Rafael Film Center.) What keeps the film from being a wallow in salaciousness is that it's not so much about sex as it is a character study. Delphine, played by the tiny and big-eyed Maud Forget, enters into the most degrading and revolting of situations with a kind of twisted conviction that, in so doing, she can prove her devotion. She is beyond the reach of words, beyond the reach of reason. She is in that state of unreasoned certainty common only to teenagers and crazed fanatics. In case anyone has forgotten, this movie is the reminder that the teen years are rough. Delphine meets Laurent in a nightclub, and soon she is having sex with him on a living-room floor. With her clothes off, she looks about 13. It's creepy to watch. Lou Doillon plays Delphine's friend Olivia, who is tall, has dreadlocks and looks like a wild woman in the making. But when their boyfriends suggest that, in order to raise money for a trip, the girls perform some 400 acts of oral sex, 200 each, in a public toilet somewhere, it's innocent Delphine who sees this as her chance to become the biggest French martyr since Joan of Arc. Oh, the horror of being a parent. Director Jean-Pierre Ameris and writer Alain Layrac outdo any outrage Larry Clark (Kids, Bully) ever dreamed of. Clark's kids seem destined for degradation to begin with, so who cares? But what happens to the girls in Bad Company can make your skin crawl. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy. Starring Vivica A. Fox and Morris Chestnut. Directed and written by Mark Brown. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The first time your man messes up, she warns, no matter how minor the infraction, punish him. Punish him hard. Shante, a senior advertising executive with a killer figure and a silver tongue, is the main player in Two Can Play That Game, a lively battle-of-the- sexes romp from first-time director Mark Brown. In part a female response to How to Be a Player, which Brown wrote, Two Can Play stars the terrific Vivica A. Fox (Soul Food) as savvy Shante and Morris Chestnut (The Brothers) as her handsome, undependable man, Keith. Two Can Play is big on raunchy knee-slappers, and yet Brown isn't working at the same glib level as he did in How to Be a Player. His writing is often insightful, and he manages to split the viewpoint between men and women: When Shante isn't delivering her hard-and-fast rules directly to the camera, Keith is getting another kind of advice from a not-so-wise co-worker (Anthony Anderson). A lot of sex comedies play women as hip and smart and men as foolish dogs ruled by their gonads. Two Can Play goes that route for a while, portraying Shante as invincible, but then surprises us with a twist that doesn't exactly redefine gender roles, but at least levels the playing field. One doesn't demand reality from this kind of film, of course. Otherwise, we'd have to point out that Shante manages to look and dress like a supermodel -- and leave her office on a moment's whim -- despite the presumed demands of a high-level management position. Fox and Chestnut are as fine looking as any two human beings could hope to be, and they have a smooth chemistry. But the best scenes are the ones that Fox shares with Tamala Jones, Wendy Raquel Robinson and the full-figured Monique as her sassy girlfriends. There's a ripe, crackling spontaneity when these women get together: They make you wish you could just sit back and listen to them forever. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"'Harvard Man' Drama. Starring Adrian Grenier, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams. Directed by James Toback. (R. 105 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Writer-director James Toback (Two Girls and a Guy) has entered that enviable career stage where his movies are automatically interesting because he made them. Like those of the best auteurs, his films are invitations to wallow in a sensibility that's hard to resist. But Toback isn't coasting. His latest, Harvard Man has everything you could ever want from a Toback movie: lurid sex, shocking excess and an out-of- nowhere thoughtfulness that's not put on; it's real. As early as Fingers (1978), Toback was showing how the highest and lowest impulses could be raging within a single individual. That same fascination is at work in Harvard Man. Adrian Grenier plays a young Harvard student with a complicated life. He's a college basketball player whose cheerleader girlfriend (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the daughter of a Mafia boss. He is also a philosophy major having an affair with his professor, played by Joey Lauren Adams. Toback isn't afraid of talkie scenes. He is comfortable using a single setup and letting the characters whip through pages of dialogue. Grenier and Adams have a long bedroom scene in which she tries to warn the drug-friendly youngster away from using LSD. It's cyanide, she says. But Toback never indulges himself at the audience's expense. He earns the right to take his time, when needed, by crafting an overall story of genuine tension -- the Mafia girlfriend ropes our young hero into a plot to throw the game. He also knows how to play with time with seeming ease, to juggle past and present in the editing to illuminate both. Grenier is a find, and Harvard Man should mark Gellar's entrance into full-fledged adulthood, as far as her castability is concerned. Yet the performer most worth noting is Adams, who would be an unlikely choice to play a philosophy professor, except that she seems to understand every word she says. Adams sparkles with quick-mindedness and verbal agility. This is a worthy and underused talent. -- Mick LaSalle Romance. Starring Anouk Aimee. Directed and written by Jacques Demy. (Not rated. 90 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere today through April 18; at the Rafael Film Center in San Rafael today through April 15.) Soft and evanescent, lyrical but bittersweet, Jacques Demy's first film is like a dream that one enters -- and then recalls for years afterward with absolute pleasure. Filmed in 1961, Lola is an ode to yearning and enchantment -- a valentine to France, to beautiful women, to the foolish but delicious notions of romance that we receive from Hollywood. Anouk Aimee (A Man and a Woman) is heavenly as Lola, a dance-hall girl in the port city of Nantes (Demy's hometown). Part phantom and part voluptuary, Lola is the kind of woman who wants always to be alluring, who wiggles when she walks, who's fond of a drink, who likes to primp and smoke and speak in a breathy voice. As a young girl, Lola dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer but got lost, she explains. Early in the story she runs into Roland (Marc Michel), an old flame who becomes smitten all over again. Lola rebuffs him; she still pines for Michel, the broad-shouldered Adonis who loved her and left her with a 7- year-old son. Demy shot Lola in black and white, dedicated it to filmmaker Max Ophuls (The Earrings of Madame de . . .) and constructs an Ophuls-like daisy chain of interconnecting chance encounters. Like Ophuls, he lets his camera glide and swirl around his characters -- as if he were embracing them and their heady illusions. Demy died in 1990 and his widow, director Agnes Varda, supervised the restoration of his exquisite, muted jewel of a film. -- Edward Guthmann 'FESTIVAL IN CANNES'Drama. Starring Anouk Aimee, Greta Scacchi, Maximilian Schell and Ron Silver. Directed by Henry Jaglom. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At the Embarcadero Center Cinema.) Henry Jaglom keeps making Henry Jaglom films, and they're always compelling, sometimes in a car-wreck sort of way and sometimes in a truthful way that's only his. Festival in Cannes is one of his better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love, set against the wheeling and dealing atmosphere of the world's most famous film festival. Jaglom, like the French director Eric Rohmer, is in love with love. Unlike Rohmer, Jaglom is a cynic. More artist than thinker, Jaglom says more than he thinks he's saying in Festival in Cannes, and that's all to the good. The festival backdrop may be intended to lend enchantment to a tale of three generations of lovers finding each other over a span of days. But under the steady gaze of Jaglom's camera, Cannes looks like a worn beach town defaced by movie billboards. Nothing of value will come of this festival -- or of these relationships. That's the cynical and refreshing message being communicated here. Anouk Aimee plays a French actress juggling two offers: a starring role in an independent film from a first-time director (Greta Scacchi) and a small role in a blockbuster being fronted by Ron Silver as a big-time Hollywood sleaze. Through this false dichotomy -- there's no reason the actress can't accept both offers -- the movie gives Aimee a chance to shine and illustrates the difficulties actors face. Everyone flatters them; everyone wants to use them. Maximilian Schell is well cast as Aimee's ex-husband, a great director who hasn't made a film in years. It's so hard to make a film, he says. Sometimes I think it's enough to dream them. The younger generation is represented by Jenny Gabrielle, as a novice who comes to Cannes an unknown and overnight finds herself the talk of the festival. It's a dream come true, but Jaglom is too honest to present the upheaval in her life as anything other than emotionally disconcerting, the kind of thing that would make any young person want to latch on to a new lover just to hold on to something. -- Mick LaSalle 'HUMAN NATURE'Comedy. Starring Patricia Arquette, Tim Robbins, Rhys Ifans and Miranda Otto. Directed by Michael Gondry. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Human Nature is a sly comedy that lives up to the promise of its title. It explores the contest between civilization and brute impulse and does so with a combination of screw-loose zaniness and intellectual rigor. The result is a satisfying and original picture. Patricia Arquette plays Lila, a young woman who, at puberty, started growing fur all over her body. As an adult, in order to pass in society, she spends a lot of time shaving herself -- everywhere. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Nathan, played by Tim Robbins at his uptight best, researches ways of teaching civilization to mammals. He gets the ultimate chance to test his behavior theories when he comes upon a man (Rhys Ifans) who was raised by apes. He brings him to his laboratory and sets about teaching him to be an ascot- wearing, wine-drinking lover of opera. Written by Charlie Kaufman, who wrote Being John Malkovich, Human Nature is characterized by smart, quirky dialogue throughout, though the funniest moments are sight gags involving the newly civilized ape man, who may have the veneer of refinement but is clearly hanging by a thread. In one scene he is taken to a restaurant and, in the midst of placing his order, leaps from the table and starts rubbing against the waitress. The fact that he is wearing an electric collar and knows he will be punished for this makes it all the funnier. The point of Human Nature is that, left to our own devices, all of us would be as impulsive and animal-like. That would hardly be worth saying, but the movie has a more subtle point -- that civilization itself, far from being an instrument of civility, is the most efficient tool through which people are able to implement and get away with their most monumental acts of selfishness and sensual gratification. Advisory: This film contains nudity, sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle 'FRAILTY'Suspense. Starring Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton. Directed by Paxton. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In his directing debut, actor Bill Paxton has made a truly awful picture instead of a merely vapid one. Frailty, about a single father who thinks God wants him to kill evildoers, is dumb but also unrelentingly dark and ugly, thereby depriving the viewer of any camp value. Daddy the Demon Slayer is played with maniacal fervor by Paxton, who could have used a good director to rein him in. He apparently directed his fellow actors, including Matthew McConaughey and granite-faced Powers Boothe, to look as morose as possible while he filled in gaps with dark filters and ominous music. The script by Brent Hanley veers from silly and hackneyed to gruesome and hackneyed. When McConaughey guesses that Boothe became an FBI agent after Boothe's mother was murdered, the agent replies, Have you thought about a career in law enforcement? You really have a feel for it. He's serious. McConaughey, as Paxton's grown-up son, has approached the FBI because he believes his brother grew up to be a serial killer like Pops. In flashback, he recalls how the dad enlisted the boys to lure people into his van, Silence of the Lambs style. Frailty focuses on the kids' trauma to an unseemly degree. The boys witness numerous killings, and one is nearly starved to death by the dad. The movie enumerates the horrors these kids experience without a glimmer of hope that they might emerge OK. Matt O'Leary, the abused kid in Domestic Disturbance, had it easy in that picture compared with what he endures here. Director Paxton bludgeons where he could finesse. When the father pulls the shade down before the umpteenth ax slaying, you think you'll be spared the carnage. No dice. The whack happens off-camera but the blood spurts into the frame. Visual cliches run rampant. Fog shrouds the public garden where the bodies are buried. Shadows from the partition in a cop car play on McConaughey's face. You can say one thing for novice director Paxton, though: The scene of a miniature angel descending through a carburetor is a true original. -- Carla Meyer 'BORSTAL BOY'Drama. Starring Shawn Hatosy, Danny Dyer and Michael York. Directed by Peter Sheridan. (Not rated. 91 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) Borstal Boy, about the early life of Irish playwright Brendan Behan, is a sincere piece of work with good performances and some illuminating moments. But it's dragged down by a slow pace, an intrinsic lack of dramatic tension and a somewhat naive treatment of the subject. The result is a film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration. The picture, based on Behan's memoirs, begins with young Brendan (Shawn Hatosy) as a 16-year-old IRA zealot who is captured by British officials before he can follow through on a plan to blow up something in Liverpool. He is sent to a British borstal -- a kind of reform school -- which turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him. Run by a sweet-natured warden (Michael York), the place is more like a boy's camp than a prison. Some scenes have a casual truth about them that feels right. At night, chilling newsreels of the Battle of Britain are shown on a movie screen, but the boys barely react -- they just clown around and talk, waiting for the feature to start. The growing friendship between Brendan and a young gay sailor (Danny Dyer), treated with sensitivity and detail, becomes the center of the film. Yet something in the film's handling of Behan's emerging homosexuality feels a little too politically correct -- too accepted, too cozy and too easy. For a macho Irish kid in 1940, there had to be some inner conflict. Or if the conflict wasn't there, where was it? Somewhere, for sure. Behan went on to drink himself to death in his early 40s. Yet there's no hint here of anything clouding this young man's psyche. It might be admirable that writer and co- director Peter Sheridan avoids cheap theatrics, but no one should be congratulated in avoiding all theatrics. That's just denying the dictates of the medium. Advisory: This film contains strong language, violence and some sexuality. -- Mick LaSalle 'THE OTHER SIDE OF HEAVEN'Drama. Starring Christopher Gorham and Anne Hathaway. Directed and written by Mitch Davis. (PG. 113 minutes. At the Galaxy.) In the 1950s, John Groberg left his hometown of Idaho Falls and went halfway across the world to the Kingdom of Tonga, a South Pacific archipelago where he was sent as a missionary by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Groberg was 19 when he left his home and spent the first months on Tonga struggling with language barriers, hurricanes, mosquitoes and the islanders' suspicions. His 1993 memoir, In the Eye of the Storm, has been adapted as The Other Side of Heaven, a film that recaptures his early adventures and uses them as an example of the benefits of missionary work. The Other Side of Heaven, made without church sponsorship, is handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism. Directed and written by Mitch Davis, it focuses primarily on Groberg's cultural adjustments on the island of Niuatoputapu but slips occasionally into sermonettes extolling the virtues of Christian service. Christopher Gorham, who looks a bit like the young Tom Hanks, is appealing as Groberg. Arriving at the island where he will live for three years, Groberg cuts an odd profile in his suit and narrow tie, surrounded by skeptical island men in grass skirts and women who titter that he looks whiter than soap. Groberg learned Tongan by reading the Scriptures, but for some reason the islanders, played mostly by New Zealand actors, speak English once he has learned Tongan. The South Pacific photography by Brian Breheny is very strong - - the film was shot in the Cook Islands -- and Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) is lovely as the girlfriend Groberg leaves behind. -- Edward Guthmann 'SON OF THE BRIDE'Drama. Starring Ricardo Darin, Hector Alterio and Norma Aleandro. Directed by Juan Jose Campanella. Written by Campanella and Fernando Castets. (Rated R. 124 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) In Buenos Aires, a workaholic restaurant owner neglects his daughter and mother and hasn't time for his girlfriend. Your life's like a marathon, a potential buyer observes. You remind me of a juggler spinning plates. Rafael, the lead character in Son of the Bride, is one more manifestation of a cinematic cliche: the pent-up, cell-phone-addicted businessman who has to hit the wall before he can smell the roses. Juan Jose Campanella directs with such care and affection, however, and Ricardo Darin plays the lead character and his transitions so gracefully that it all goes down quite easily. Nominated for an Oscar as best foreign-language drama -- it lost to No Man's Land -- Son of the Bride finds Rafael suffering from tax pressures, reduced profit margin and a financial climate that allows chains to buy at wholesale but penalizes mom-and-pop businessess. All that madness has made him a monster, but after a mild heart attack and extended hospital stay he's a changed man -- and wants off the fast track. Son of the Bride manages to be affectionate without drawing too deeply from a well of sugar and schmaltz. After Rafael's breakthrough, his dad (Hector Alterio) announces that he wants to remarry his mother in a church wedding. There's dubious virtue in turning the Alzheimer's-stricken mom (Norma Aleandro) into a spunky, slightly raunchy woman-child, but Campanella, whose own parents remarried late in life, finds the right tone and creates a very sweet moment with the elders' wedding. Advisory: This film contains raw language and sexual situations. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"'Hey Arnold! The Movie' RATING: (Polite Applause) Cartoon comedy. Voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Lloyd. Directed by Tuck Tucker. (G. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) On the other hand, if this is news, you are obviously not in fourth grade. Hey Arnold! has been an animated Nickelodeon sensation since its premiere in 1996, watched by 45 million kids (and their parents) a month. This movie takes Arnold and his scruffy neighborhood with a heart to the big screen. Arnold and his offbeat pals exist in the same parallel universe as their Nickelodeon first cousins Rugrats. Parents are goofy and ineffectual, and mostly around for comic relief. Kids are wise, tolerant and almost entirely without supervision. Problems crop up -- which adults either misunderstand or find so overwhelming that they give up immediately -- and it is left to the young heroes to save the day. They do so, generally after learning a valuable (and politically correct) lesson. Arnold, who lives in a boardinghouse with his grandparents, is the conscience of the gang, nudging his pals to do the right, if sometimes painful, thing. That's why they respect him, even if they do call him Football Head. Although no dedicated Hey Arnold! fan will buy the premise of the big crisis -- You knew they weren't going to tear down the neighborhood, said our fifth-grade demographic representative -- it is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters. Parents will also enjoy picking out the sly movie references from Shawshank Redemption to Casablanca to Men in Black with stops at Speed and Mission: Impossible. They also may wish Christopher Lloyd's (Back to the Future) batty character had more lines. One quibble. Despite an obvious commitment to diversity -- a bus driver, for example, is a disabled vet -- there aren't many girl characters. However, devoted fans will want to know that Helga, Arnold's powerhouse rival, finally fesses up and says the L-word to Arnold. Hey, in the neighborhood, that's the biggest news since Stinky and Sid mooned Principal Wartz. -- C.W. Nevius Historical fantasy. Starring Ian Holm and Iben Hjejle. Directed by Alan Taylor. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) While watching Ian Holm in this charming historical fantasy, it occurred to me that this actor has perfectly nailed Napoleon's famous way of walking. Then I remembered -- I've never seen Napoleon walking. There are no Napoleonic newsreels. There's only a Napoleonic tradition in movies -- one that this new film has fun with. Based on The Death of Napoleon, a novel by Simon Leys, The Emperor's New Clothes offers an alternative version of history. What if Napoleon had escaped from exile on St. Helena? What if he had found a double to take his place on the island and made his way to Paris? The result is a genre-bending yarn, an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans. Holm has a dual role. He plays the emperor, stern and strutting, and he also plays his double, a lowly deckhand who finds exile on St. Helena to be a cozy vacation. He can't get enough of lying around all day eating English cuisine. Meanwhile, Napoleon is struggling, toiling on a ship and, later, doing everything he can to slip unnoticed into France -- everything, that is, except part his hair on the side. It has been said that the diminutive emperor had a way of looking down at people even as he looked up at them. Holm, who is the right height for the role, also has the authoritative bearing, the steely eyes, the aura of unshakable resolve. His is a decidedly Anglo Napoleon, however: There's no perfumed handkerchief or pretense of delicacy in this performance. This is a soldier who's been in jail for six years. In his few scenes as the faux Napoleon, Holm shows us the mechanics of a Napoleonic performance, as he assumes the walk and assumes the airs. He's very funny. The Danish actress Iben Hjejle brings a warm quality to the role of Pumpkin, a melon merchant who falls in love with Napoleon while he's incognito -- and becomes concerned when he develops signs of that age-old delusion: He thinks he's Napoleon. Advisory: This film has strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Philippe Noiret, Jacques Perrin and Agnese Nano. Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. (R. 172 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Go figure: The old version of Cinema Paradiso, which won the best foreign film Oscar for 1989, was a masterpiece. But this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera. Even the most ardent fan of Giuseppe Tornatore will not be able to help noticing that this gifted director has screwed up a beautiful thing. The restored minutes, which were cut before the film's successful premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 1989, throw off the movie's balance, alter relationships and add plodding details. Cinema Paradiso: The New Version is of interest only in that it shows the ungainly hunk of marble from which Tornatore carved his delicate classic. The movie is presented as a memory piece. Salvatore (Jacques Perrin), an internationally lauded film director, looks back on his childhood in postwar Sicily, where his life revolved around the local movie house, the Paradiso. We meet Salvatore as a child; then we see him in adolescence, experiencing first love with a local girl named Elena (Agnese Nano). Later, we see him in his early 50s, returning home after many years to attend the funeral of the gruff old projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), a father figure whose counsel changed his life. The marvel of the original Cinema Paradiso was the sense of nostalgia the 32-year-old Tornatore was able to bring to the piece. It seemed the work of an older or at least middle-aged man. But the New Version is naive in ways that make it seem very much a young man's movie. Most of the restored footage can be found in the last section, which now feels like a film in itself. It tells the far-fetched story of how Salvatore has been pining for his first sweetheart all his life. The movie wants us to believe that he has wasted the past 30 years, unable to make a meaningful connection with any woman, because one girl left him. In the original movie, the most important relationship was that of the boy and Alfredo. The New Version makes Elena the pivotal person in his life, and we don't buy it. Something heartfelt becomes something almost silly, and the movie barely survives. Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'I Capture the Castle' Comedy-drama. Starring Romola Garai, Rose Byrne, Tara Fitzgerald, Bill Nighy. Directed by Tim Frywell. (R. 113 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) Based on a novel by Dodie Smith, who later wrote 101 Dalmatians, this 1930s British period-piece celebrates the ragged elegance of a once-noteworthy family, thrown into poverty by their brilliant father's (Bill Nighy) profound writer's block. Teenage daughters Cassandra (Romola Garai) and Rose (Rose Byrne) remain peach-cheeked and hopeful amid the ruins, and the whole place -- including a swimmable moat -- seems frightfully romantic. And terribly funny. A kooky Tara Fitzgerald (Brassed Off) leads the charge as the girls' stepmother, who tries to hold the family together while maintaining her status as England's pre-eminent muse. This involves a lot of standing in the rain, nude. But she's savvy enough to spot a meal ticket, and sees two marks in the American brothers (Henry Thomas and Marc Blucas) in England to claim their inheritance, which includes the castle on which the writer's family owes back rent. The brothers' arrival sets up a lively scene in which Rose, played with eager charm by the bright-eyed Byrne, tries to woo the young men with her bad piano playing and singing. The scene works so well because Byrne gives her character a serene confidence in her own talents, despite all evidence to the contrary. But cynicism soon invades. Cassandra overhears the brothers mocking her family, then discovers that Rose would marry Thomas' character even without loving him. At this point, Castle goes from fanciful to dramatic, a somewhat disconcerting shift but one that suits Garai, who's too naturalistic for whimsy. Her character becomes protagonist and moral compass, and even enters a romantic triangle with one of the brothers and a gorgeous, lovelorn handyman played with touching earnestness by Henry Cavill. Nighy is the movie's real standout, creating a shell of a man whose bursts of anger and ego are the only things holding him up. The father is not unkind, just impervious to the wreckage around him. Thomas and Blucas fare less well. Thomas (the kid from E.T.) just seems out of his element, whereas Blucas mimics the swift, assured cadences of 1930s movie heroes -- a daring but distracting approach that should have been discouraged by director Tim Frywell. I Capture the Castle carries an R rating, putting it out of reach of the literate, curious teenage girls who might have made up its audience. And all for a little nudity. -- Carla Meyer Comedy. Starring Kick Curry, Maya Stange and Marton Csokas. Directed by Alex Proyas. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . The films of director Alex Proyas (The Crow, Dark City) have been known for hyper-charged visuals, grand apocalyptic settings and a mood of existential despair. But his new movie constitutes a departure -- it's small and it's a comedy, about wannabe rock stars in Australia. Though the storytelling is a bit lopsided, the slapdash quality is charming overall, and the movie benefits from colorful characters and a couple of hilarious scenes. Proyas' enormous visual gift -- which could also be called his gift for the visually enormous -- is like a giant in a birdcage here, and every so often he can't resist letting it break out and stomp around. It tramples nothing, just adds to the fun. There are two drug sequences, filmed flamboyantly and played strictly for laughs, and several instances in which he inventively uses words flashing across the screen for comic effect. The story takes a familiar formula -- a band goes from rags to riches -- and plays with it. It begins with a band, headed by lead singer Freddy (Kick Curry), performing in an enormous arena. But that turns out only to be a fantasy, and a sex fantasy, no less. Freddy and his friends have never played a gig and are trying to get a leg up, while coping with a bunch of interpersonal problems. The main one is that the guitarist's girlfriend, Kate (Maya Stange), is in love with Freddy -- but she is pregnant by the guitarist (Brett Stiller). The other problem is that the guitarist is mentally ill. Indeed, he's severely mentally ill, and this worrisome element, though unexpected and arguably daring, becomes a drag on the comedy. The movie seems much more sure-handed in its comic moments, as when Freddy makes contact with an oily impresario (Marton Csokas). The romantic element also works well, thanks to the emotional presence of Stange, who also starred this season in XX/XY and has become an actress worth watching. -- Mick LaSalle Starring Nick Nolte, Daryl Hannah and James Woods. Directed by Michael Polish. (PG-13. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . In making Northfork, the filmmaking Polish brothers, Mark and Michael, had a feeling (a wistfulness, a sense of loss). They had a subject (the destruction of a town to make way for power and industry), and they had a vision. Indeed, they had a beautiful vision: This low-budget entry is as stunningly and as intelligently shot as any film this season. But they had no story. Hardly an example of unconventional storytelling, Northfork eschews story altogether. In its place are empty gestures, cute feints, meaningless scenes attempting to get by on gimmick casting and, all in all, a bunch of utter nonsense. Audiences will be confused, but confusion is not the problem. Northfork is numbing and inert. The movie takes place in Montana, 1955, in the days before the entire town of Northfork gets destroyed by a new dam. Nick Nolte, the town priest, is preaching to his congregation, looking as at home in a clerical collar as the Big Bad Wolf dressed as Granny. James Woods, along with other men in fedoras , are trying to hustle the last stragglers out of town. And a team of supernatural beings, including a hermaphrodite (Daryl Hannah), is looking for an angel. The angel may or may not be a bespectacled little boy (Duel Farnes), who happens to look just like Harry Truman, which is interesting -- except Eisenhower was already president by 1955 -- so what does it all mean? Nothing. But director Michael Polish, who wrote the screenplay with his brother Mark, manages to string it out for 103 minutes. What keeps the film from being a form of torture is its look. The filmmakers adopted a consistent color palette, whether filming interiors or exteriors. Grays and browns dominate. The colors have a muted, matte finish, and yet seem metallic in quality, like a Magritte painting. To see Northfork is to hope that the Polish brothers continue to make movies but stop writing them. -- Mick LaSalle Erotic drama. Directed by Juan Luis Iborra and Yolanda Garcia Serrano. (Not rated. 108 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At the Embarcadero and Shattuck in Berkeley.) . It's high noon in Puerta del Sol, the central plaza of Madrid, and the combination of heat, humidity and midsummer indolence have triggered the libidos of 14 disparate Madrilenos. A low-rent hooker (Elisa Matilla) makes a date with an awkward accountant (Alberto San Juan), but once she arrives at Kilometer Zero, she mistakes a hunky young filmmaker (Carlos Fuentes) for the john and takes him home instead. The accountant, meanwhile, ends up having a drink with a carefree gay dude, who missed his hookup with an Internet date because the Internet date met a sexy dancer (Victor Ullate Jr.) instead. Missed connections. Serendipitous couplings. A bitter, 50ish wife (Concha Velasco) who hires a beautiful male gigolo (Jesus Cabrero) and is shocked to discover their shared past. So it goes in Kilometer Zero -- also known as Km.0 -- a superficial diversion from co-directors Juan Luis Iborra and Yolanda Garcia Serrano. The directors' objective, one gathers immediately, is to plumb the erotic energies and psychological nuances found in the work of their compatriot Pedro Almodovar. Instead of cooking up a fresh variation of Almodovar's spicy, pansexual paellas, they've delivered a bland, contrived soap opera. The cast members are nice to look at and occasionally give vivid performances -- especially Merce Pons as a desperately ambitious actress -- but the offbeat pairings and foiled expectations in this extended daisy chain are wholly predictable. -- Edward Guthmann Historical drama. Starring Misa Shimizu, Masatoshi Nagase and Hidetaka Yoshioka. Directed by Kei Kumai. Written by Akira Kurosawa. In Japanese with subtitles. (R. 119 minutes. At Opera Plaza.) . Life in the time of the samurai in Tokyo's Edo period (pre-1868) was no picnic. A strict caste system was in place, and a woman who found herself alone and without means might easily end up working in a brothel. So why does this film about the red light district on the edge of Tokyo Bay glow with sunlight and echo with laughter? Except for what the women call the work, the brothel looks like a great place to earn a living. The reason is the heart of the project, the director Akira Kurosawa. Although he died in 1998, he still had projects in the pipeline. This is one of them. Using his drawings and production notes, director Kei Kumai, channels some of the dramatic imagery of the master. Kumai, who was chosen by Kurosawa's son, Hisao, to bring the story to the screen, doesn't make it obvious that this is a Kurosawa production, but the touches, especially the use of light, are unmistakable. It does, however, make for an unusually cheerful depiction of prostitution. You've never seen such wholesome hookers. One minute they are out in the street of the red light district, grabbing men. But when they are inside the house they giggle like schoolgirls and fret over one another's problems. The story revolves around Oshin (Nagiko Tono), who, it is said, has a good heart. She shouldn't keep giving it away. Oshin keeps falling in love with her customers, in particular a young samurai (Hidetaka Yoshioka) who hides in the house to escape ramifications after he slashes an important higher-up in a drunken brawl. But the soul of the story is Kikuno (veteran Japanese actress Misa Shimizu). Her part, as the older, wiser but still romantic role model for Oshin, has all the subtleties of a great performance. Her farewell, against a star- sprinkled sky, is an image that will stay in your mind's eye. It is, however, a long way to the climatic typhoon at the finish. Running a full two hours, the film asks viewers to become caught up in the social mores and caste system of 19th century Japan. It is a little like following a Jane Austen novel. There are some things that are simply not done, as odd and antiquated as the taboos seem. You'll have to accept that to enjoy this look at a distant time and place. -- C.W. Nevius ",1
"'Igby Goes Down' Comedy-drama. Starring Kieran Culkin, Ryan Phillippe, Bill Pullman and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Burr Steers. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's not a vanity product, but it has the whiff of one. Writer-director Burr Steers, according to publicity, is from a privileged New York background and imparted his own voice to the character of 17-year-old Igby Slocumb (Kieran Culkin), who escapes military school and goes on a New York adventure armed with his mother's credit card. Steers' film shares young Igby's contempt for the hypocrisy and coldness of the world he was born into, but seems blind to what's obvious to anyone watching -- Igby is the coldest, most hate-filled and contemptible character in the movie. Instead, Steers remains consumed by faith that the kid is charming and witty. People tell Igby, You're funny, when he's clearly not. Two older women, an artist played by Amanda Peet and a pretentious student played by Claire Danes, throw themselves at him -- for no discernible reason. It's a measure of the film's skewed point of view that Igby's crisis -- where will he go to school? -- is presented as a matter of grave significance, while his headstrong mother's (Susan Sarandon) gradual death from cancer is presented as incidental. Throughout, every time Igby hears that his mother has taken a turn for the worse, he says, So what? In between the flat one-liners, there is one genuine laugh-out-loud scene. That's when Bill Pullman, as Igby's schizophrenic dad, gets into the shower with his clothes on and smashes everything to pieces, ending up covered in blood. However, I think that's the one scene Steers expected us to take seriously. Advisory: This film contains nudity, strong language and drug use. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Michel Bouquet, Charles Berling, Natacha Regnier, Stephane Guillon. Directed by Anne Fontaine. Written by Jacques Fieschi and Anne Fontaine. (Not rated. 100 minutes. French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) The son, Jean-Luc (Charles Berling), and his younger brother live on an estate in Versailles, a wealthy Paris suburb where people get Botox injections and throw catered parties for their elite friends and neighbors. The dad (Michel Bouquet) practices medicine in a poor part of Africa. When he sees Jean-Luc's gilded house and work environment, he doesn't hesitate to knock its pretensions, which grates on Jean-Luc. But the father's up-front nature is refreshing to his other son (Stephane Guillon), an aspiring comic who works as driver and personal assistant to Jean-Luc and his wife (Natacha Regnier). Fontaine has created a drama that is a dash of Tennessee Williams (the dialogue is cutting and precise, as when Jean-Luc's father tells him, I'm not obligated to love you), a dash of Hitchcock and a big dash of originality. In the beginning of How I Killed My Father, Jean-Luc gets a letter announcing his father's death. Are the scenes that follow an imagination of what could have happened if the dad had remained alive, or is what we're seeing a flashback to something that actually occurred? Fontaine deliberately leaves it vague, letting the audience fill in the blanks and reaching whatever conclusion it wants. All answers seem to point to the same denouement: That Jean-Luc used his father's frustrating reappearance and agonizing death as a catalyst for self-reflection and growth. Under Fontaine's direction, family dysfunction is an intense experience with unexpectedly positive repercussions, even if the steps between are painful and potentially deadly. Bouquet gives a performance that is masterly. His eyes and expressions tell a truth as powerful as the plot's points. Advisory: This film contains sex scenes and violence. -- Jonathan Curiel Drama. Starring Hiam Abbass, Hend El Fahem and Maher Kamoun. Directed by Raja Amari. (Not rated. 89 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) In the Western world, such stories are routine, but Tunisia is a Muslim nation. Even so, director Raja Amari (a woman) doesn't soften the message and injects no note of ambiguity in presenting as a worthwhile endeavor, a woman's effort to reclaim her sexual identity, autonomy and power. This makes Satin Rouge both curious from a cultural perspective and refreshing. At the start, it looks like a bleak life. Lilia is, essentially, her teenage daughter's maid. The child is always out, while Mom mends, cleans, cooks and knits. Lilia gets into the cabaret scene accidentally, showing up one night half-expecting to see her daughter (Hend El Fahem). She soon becomes friends with one of the dancers, who encourages her to get out there and strut her stuff herself. Next thing she knows, strange men are ogling and throwing cash at her. Actress Hiam Abbass expertly traces Lilia's journey from old-before-her- time to suddenly-young-again. Downcast at the start, we watch her opening up like a flower in stop-motion photography, a heartening and at times fascinating process. In Satin Rouge, when Lilia is able to get up and, with no embarrassment, flaunt her womanly power in a room full of relatives and friends, that's a victory -- over expectation, convention, and the familiar and all-too easy patterns of self. Advisory: This film contains sexuality and provocative dancing. -- Mick LaSalle Docudrama. Starring Jia Hongsheng. Directed by Zhang Yang. Written by Zhang Yang and Huo Xin. (Rated R. 112 minutes. In Mandarin with English subtitles. Opens today at the Lumiere and Camera 3 in San Jose, Sept. 27 at the Shattuck in Berkeley.) In Quitting, an odd fusion of documentary and fiction, Jia plays himself in re-enacted scenes from his sliding-down past: getting hooked on drugs while rehearsing a 1992 stage production of Kiss of the Spider Woman, rejecting his parents's peasant ways, identifying with Robert De Niro's Taxi Driver psychopath and connecting so deeply to John Lennon's music that he believes he's Lennon's son. It's downbeat material and it tends to drag a bit, but Jia's performance is so unsparing and intense -- and the film so compassionate and chaste in its approach to a life lost and recovered -- that Quitting ultimately satisfies. Jia's parents, provincial theater actors who moved to Beijing to save their son, play themselves in the film, as do friends, colleagues, doctors and fellow mental patients. Some of the best scenes involve Jia and his father (Jia Fengsen) who, desperate to help his son, wanders through Beijing with him on aimless walks. Stopping next to a freeway cloverleaf to lie in the grass, father and son drink beer and contemplate the world. Dressed in a leather jacket and tight-fitting jeans, Jim stares at the sky, spreads his arms out like a crucifix -- we get the point -- and sings the Chinese translation to Lennon's Let It Be lyrics. Cut to Dad visiting a foreign-language record store to buy cassettes of The Beatles -- which he pronounces da bidus. After four years, drug abuse has made Jia paranoid and delusional, and his parents commit him to a mental hospital. Zhang's direction here is so delicate that, and his handling of real mental patients so unexploitive, that the asylum scenes don't bring the film down -- but give it a simple, unexpected poetry. Advisory: This film contains raw language. -- Edward Guthmann Drama. Directed by Ferzan Ozpetek. (Not rated. 105 minutes. In Italian with English subtitles. At the Embarcadero and the Shattuck in Berkeley.) Following Massimo's accidental death, Antonia finds the crack in the mirror: Massimo not only kept a male lover, but was deeply tied to the lover's extended, mixed-race family of gays, lesbians and trannies. Intrigued more than hurt, Antonia befriends her husband's lover Michele (Stefano Accorsi) -- they're widows in common -- and before long embraces the bawdy communards that her husband loved. Directed by Ferzan Ozpetek (Steam: The Turkish Bath), His Secret Life wears its multi-culti, rainbow-flag hipness with pride, but plays nonetheless like a social-issue melodrama from the '70s. Wife discovers husband's homosexuality, can't compete with a man the way she would with a woman and confronts her own latent homophobia. Typically, these scenarios have the heroine struggling to validate her attractiveness and rebuild her identity. But Margherita Buy, who plays Antonia, is a lovely woman and Ozpetek, who co-wrote with Gianni Romoli, turns her crisis into sugar-coated self-affirmation. After an initial chill, she charms the extended family, revives the spirits of a young AIDS patient and bewitches an even younger Turkish stud who wants to bed her. Ozpetek, Turkish by birth but based in Italy since 1978, stirs up the suds as Antonia grows tighter with her husband's lover. It's pretty to look at it but there's not much meat beneath the scented dressing. Pure of intention and passably diverting, His Secret Life is light, innocuous and unremarkable. Advisory: This film contains raw language and sexual situations. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"'Interview' Black comedy. Starring Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller. Directed by Steve Buscemi. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There's nothing more horrible than the celebrity interview. The public thinks of the experience as glamorous, but for the journalist, it's the opposite. It's the experience of asking questions without being interested in the answers and of taking dictation from a liar. No matter how you do it, it's degrading. Play along, and you feed the evil machine. Struggle against it, and you end up fighting with strangers over control of what's rightfully theirs -- their own lives. In Interview, Steve Buscemi plays a journalist who can't believe his career has sunk so low that he has to interview Katya -- she's known by only the one name, like Madonna -- a young actress in horrible TV shows and slasher movies who's notorious for her revolving-door sex life. Pierre (Buscemi) sees himself as an enterprising political reporter. In true journalistic tradition, he knows nothing about this woman, and in true disgusted-reporter tradition, he has made no effort to find out. When Katya (Sienna Miller) shows up an hour late for the interview, he does little to conceal his disdain, and this causes her to bolt out of the restaurant within minutes. In real life, that would have been the end of it, but movies are more interesting than real life, which is why people pay to see them instead of looking out the window for free. Circumstances throw the journalist and the actress together in her loft apartment, and what ensues is an evening of drinking and game playing, revelations and false revelations, in which the protagonists sometimes seem to be bonding and, at other times, seem to be trying to crack and destroy each other. Katya is a narcissist and a substance abuser, smoothing over her own colossal selfishness with a breezy and phony charm, and Pierre is a mess -- creepy and full of hostility, with the look of a man just beginning to catch on that he's flushed his life down the toilet. Picture Buscemi with that look. He can do it better than anyone, and Miller has never held the screen with such command. That special quality that she's had in previous films, such as Factory Girl and Casanova, has blossomed into genuine star power. And, unlike many actresses her age (25), she comes across as a fully adult woman. The film is a remake of a Dutch film of the same name, by the late Theo van Gogh. The van Gogh film starred a real Katya (Katja Schuurman), who is apparently a sensation in the Netherlands, and this may explain the American film's one weakness: Despite the fact that both protagonists are equally appalling, the screenplay seems to have a soft spot for the woman. However, this doesn't take away from the fun of watching the two characters tear each other to pieces. -- Advisory: Drug use, sexual references and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle 'Manufactured Landscapes'  Documentary. Directed by Jennifer Baichwal. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Jennifer Baichwal's documentary examines the art and preoccupations of photographer and fellow Canadian Edward Burtynsky. The filmmaker follows him into villages in China where peasants do the toxic piecework of prizing precious metals from numberless discarded circuit boards. She records Burtynsky shooting the perilous ship-breaking scavengers of Bangladesh, who dismantle decommissioned tankers by hand. And she follows the photographer as he seeks views to comprehend China's Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest construction project, and the toll it has taken in displacing scores of settlements. Again and again, Baichwal tapers passages of her film toward resolution in the form of a finished picture by Burtynsky, telescoping her vision and his. Although the film nowhere announces it -- Baichwal keeps a discreet editorial distance throughout -- the viewer soon realizes that she shares Burtynsky's astonishment and concern over the scale, tempo and irreversibility of postmodern humanity's global frenzy of production and consumption. Baichwal also brings to her study of Burtynsky technical capacities beyond his medium: the recording of sound and motion. She opens her film with a tracking shot that spans the length of a factory floor in China, a shot so prolonged that a viewer suspects her of having looped the film. But no, an end view finally reveals an interior so vast it exceeds the lens' reach. She lets the ambient sound of the factory slowly intensify our astonishment at its immensity. Baichwal also delves into the human detail that eludes Burtynsky's encompassing camera views and their silence. She takes us down to the workbenches where young Chinese workers assemble, inspect and test unnamed widgets endlessly. Their dexterity is impressive, but it also promises burnout ahead. No one in the factory looks older than 40. These workers briefly give faces and voices to the huge, churning industries that Burtynsky and Baichwal survey. Manufactured Landscapes leaves its audience with many troubling questions. Among them: Should a film console us with its own brilliance when it aims to discomfit us with its content? -- Kenneth Baker 'Falling for Grace'  Romantic comedy-drama. Starring Fay Ann Lee, Gale Harold and Margaret Cho. Directed by Fay Ann Lee. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At the Kabuki.) There is an affecting story within first-time filmmaker Fay Ann Lee's Falling for Grace, but it is merely a subplot, one among too many that decorate this thin, unsatisfying romantic comedy-drama. Serving as the writer, director, producer and star, Lee worked on the film for a decade, apparently losing all sense of perspective in that struggle to get it made. Her movie is a mess with moments of transcendence, suggesting that Lee has talent. But she needs to learn how to get out of her own way. Lee plays Grace Tang, an investment banker and daughter of immigrant parents raised in Manhattan's Chinatown, who -- for reasons never adequately explained -- wants to hobnob with New York high society. When she is mistaken for a Hong Kong heiress at a party, it is her golden ticket into that world. She lets the lie stand, even as she falls for the socially conscious scion of a Wall Street titan, lawyer Andrew Barrington Jr. (Gale Harold), going so far as to introduce her parents as an indigent family she is helping out, just to keep the charade going. It is a tepid love story, played out to Andrew Hollander's obnoxious score. Lee and Harold generate no sparks, and their performances are abysmal. As a director, Lee clearly has not mastered the art of working with actors. Most of the performances, including those of the normally dependable Roger Rees and Christine Baranski as Andrew's parents, are awful. But then the actors have not been given much to work with, as the characters rarely rise above the level of stereotype. It is only when Grace is with her mother (Elizabeth Sung) and father (Clem Cheung) that Falling for Grace hints at what might have been. There is a genuine poignancy in these moments as the dutiful daughter tries to care for aging parents who are proud and stubborn. These scenes are terrific. It is a tragedy that Lee did not simply forget all about the romance. This story of filial devotion is the one she should have been telling all along. -- Pam Grady ",1
"'Jimmy and Judy' Drama. With Edward Furlong, Rachael Bella and James Eckhouse. Directed by Randall K. Rubin and Jon Schroder. (R. 99 minutes. At the AMC 1000 Van Ness, UA Stonestown and at the Oaks in Berkeley.) Jimmy and Judy is a good movie by any standard, and a textbook example of how to make your independent film for under $500,000. Using some of the same tricks that worked for The Blair Witch Project, Randall K. Rubin and Jon Schroder create a shocking but believable portrait of psychopathic behavior by a disenfranchised youth. It's a difficult film to watch, with levels of violence and nudity that will challenge some viewers and offend others, but ultimately serves the story. Jimmy (Edward Furlong) is a very smart but unhinged 21-year-old who insists on filming the important moments in his life. He falls for Judy (Rachael Bella), another outcast who is turned on by his love for her -- and also his capacity for revenge and violence. Their behavior becomes more destructive during a crime spree throughout Kentucky. Rubin and Schroder film the entire movie through the lens of Jimmy's camera. This requires a lot of creativity with the script, along with some patience on the part of the audience. Several key moments are played out only with the audio, including one pivotal scene where the camera sits motionless on the floor of a car for several minutes. Both leads are excellent, especially Bella, who must sell her attraction to the unbalanced Jimmy -- and run around nude for long stretches of the film. Props also must go to veteran TV actor James Eckhouse, who is excellent in a role that his agent must have forbidden him from taking. The hardest part for moviegoers is figuring out what to make of Jimmy, who is treated as a sympathetic figure, even as his actions hurt innocent people. And while Rubin and Schroder have a good script, it becomes difficult to believe that the video camera would remain on around a paranoid crankhead. But these are small problems in a movie filled with bigger rewards. This is the film that Natural Born Killers wanted to be -- and at one-twentieth the cost. -- Advisory: Violence, a rape scene, profanity, nudity and a kinky sex act involving the guy who played Brandon's dad on Beverly Hills 90210. -- Peter Hartlaub Mockumentary. Directed by Debbie Isitt. With Martin Freeman, Jessica Stevenson, Stephen Mangan, Meredith MacNeill, Robert Webb and Olivia Colman. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Mockumentaries usually live or die on their pseudo accuracy. Christopher Guest is the acknowledged master of the genre because he lulls you into believing his amateur actors and prideful dog owners exist off screen. But Confetti may be too convincing for its own good. The problem with this pretend documentary about engaged couples competing for most over-the-top nuptials is that it comes perilously close to what's on reality TV. The wedding planners who lend their expertise to contestants are right out of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and finding actual people eager to turn their ceremony into a three-ring circus would be a piece of cake -- wedding cake, in this instance. Can a television show based on such a premise be far behind? Like a wedding, Confetti goes on too long but is not without its memorable moments. Most of them are supplied by a wickedly talented young British cast as the betrothed behaving bizarrely. Martin Freeman (from the original BBC version of The Office) brings a hilarious button-down seriousness to Matt, a working-class stiff with a penchant for show tunes. He and his fiancee, Sam (the equally straight-faced Jessica Stevenson), show up at an audition held by Confetti, England's premier wedding magazine. Three semifinalists will have their nuptials paid for by the magazine. The winners, judged on the originality with which they exchange their vows, will receive a house -- no small prize. Pitching his all-singing, all-dancing Hollywood musical wedding, Freeman's Matt is as somber as if he were applying for funds to start a small business. He and Sam make the cut, along with tennis pros Josef (Stephen Mangan) and Isabelle (Meredith MacNeill), who offer to say I do during a match, and nudists -- or naturalists as they call themselves -- Michael (Robert Webb) and Joanna (Olivia Colman), whose scheme is to march down the aisle au natural. Webb and Colman deserve special credit for making you pay attention to their repartee instead of their bodies, which are covered in nothing, not even confetti. The rest of the film deals with the couples preparing for their big day. Naturally competitive, Josef and Isabelle think too much attention is being showered on Matt and Sam and suspect the fix is in. Isabelle gets wind that the magazine staff believes her nostrils are too prominent to put on the cover featuring the winners and has her nose done. Writer-director Debbie Isitt obviously has done research into the vulnerability weddings bring out in everyone. Her clever script plays on this, appropriately exaggerating it to take into consideration the added pressure these couples are under. Relatives make matters worse. But by the time Confetti gets around to the ceremonies, it has run out of steam. What should be the funniest scenes drag on. After sitting through one wedding, you're ready to take your party favor and go home. -- Advisory: Nudity. -- Ruthe Stein Documentary. Directed by Patricia Foulkrod. (R. 78 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For people willing to hear the soldiers' experience of war rather than just define it in comfortable terms, through yellow ribbons and high-sounding slogans, The Ground Truth is an enlightening documentary. Virtually everyone interviewed on screen is a veteran. Some came back able-bodied but afflicted in spirit. Some lost a limb, and one man had his face destroyed. No, it's not pretty. The Ground Truth packs in a lot of information, from stories about recruitment officers' lies to accounts of the ways the Veterans Administration avoids treating soldiers for post-traumatic stress. These combat veterans, male and female, speak with candor and introspection about the war, from a vantage point the public is never privy to. They tell stories about soldiers abusing innocent civilians and killing women and children. These veterans aren't pacifists, but patriotic individuals, some of them Marines, who enlisted in the aftermath of Sept. 11. Directed by Patricia Foulkrod, this is a documentary with a point of view, and obviously not every veteran of the war was interviewed. Some veterans would undoubtedly feel differently about the experience. But feelings aside, just some of the facts revealed by The Ground Truth are surprising. For example, in World War II, according to Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, too many men came out of basic training unwilling to take human life, so the training was revamped during Vietnam to turn soldiers into killing machines. Several Iraq veterans recall the marching cadences used stateside, violent and supposedly funny, intended to desensitize soldiers to killing civilians and mowing down children. This training makes it very difficult to assimilate themselves back into civilian life. Unforgettable footage shows Iraqis, as seen through gun sights, getting either shot or blown up. Soldiers are shown manhandling prisoners, who are probably innocent, and standing in people's homes, armed to the teeth and pushing old ladies around. According to the soldiers interviewed, such actions are a direct consequence both of their training and of the circumstances surrounding an occupation. As one veteran puts it, You don't go to war with a country without going to war with its people. Soldiers share the memories that keep them up nights: killing an innocent woman, or the sight of dead children or of entire dead families. One soldier tells the story of a supposedly big-time terrorist who was hung from a tree for three days by his hands. By the time the soldier came to interrogate the man, his hands were gangrenous and had to be amputated. Upon release from the hospital, the supposed terrorist was set free. It turned out he was an innocent man. All the veterans talk about the impossibility of returning to life as usual following their discharge. You don't fit in anywhere, except by yourself, and you hate yourself. Outbursts of violence, nightmares, and irrational flarings of temper plague them. Your world is gone, says Guardsman Demond Mullins, and you have no world to replace it with. The Ground Truth powerfully documents the human cost of the Iraq war. -- Advisory: Strong language and very disturbing footage of real-world violence and carnage. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy. With Carmen Maura, Marisa Paredes. Directed by Manuel Gomez Pereira. In Spanish with subtitles. (R. 107 minutes. At the Bridge) There are a lot of Queens in Manuel Gomez Pereira's delightful new farce, starting with the five pairs of young, good-looking men who aim to be wed in a mass-marriage. But most memorable are five of their mothers, played by grande dames of 1980s Spanish cinema, still sexy, aging gracefully and proudly displaying cleavage. In fact, considering three of them are closely identified with Pedro Almodóvar classics, this film could have been called All About My Mothers. They are Carmen Maura (Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown), Marisa Paredes (Talk to Her, All About My Mother) and Veronica Forque (Kika, Matador). Betiana Blum and Mercedes Sampietro, famous in their own right, round out the fivesome. The five mothers have their own problems with love -- one is a nymphomaniac, another is a famous actress who loves her obstinate gardener -- and they have varying degrees of acceptance to their children's lifestyle. The problems of mothers and sons come to a tipping point during a weekend at a Madrid resort that caters to gay clientele. With what amounts to 20 characters crossing paths, Pereira's job description might seem more traffic cop than director, but he rises to the challenge and adds style and splashy color to boot. Queens is pleasant, light-hearted fun that's soft, not edgy, but lest you think it's a Spanish Birdcage, consider that Forque's nymphomaniac, who gives way to her urges in the worst moments, and with the least appropriate people, seduces her son's fiancee by accident. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, profanity. -- G. Allen Johnson Documentary. Directed by Robert Greenwald. (Not rated. 75 mins. At the Opera Plaza.) Like Robert Greenwald's earlier documentaries aimed at Wal-Mart, Rupert Murdoch and other subjects that enrage progressives, this film is a blast of fury. Greenwald's ire here is directed at firms like Blackwater Security, Halliburton (and its KBR unit) and Titan Corp. that have won billions of dollars in contracts for services to the U.S. military in Iraq. The filmmaker contends that these corporations have squandered the lives of some of their civilian workers, operated wastefully and made unconscionable profits. The movie plays like a steady drumbeat: Outrage after outrage is alleged. We hear from tearful relatives of Americans who suffered grisly deaths in a much-publicized 2004 incident in Fallujah. Family members say Blackwater cut corners and neglected to provide their drivers with armored vehicles and weaponry. The company escaped consequences, the film says, by hiring high-powered lobbyists with GOP connections and launching an all-out damage-control campaign in Congress. The litany of misdeeds continues as we hear from assorted former consultants, ex-interrogators at Abu Ghraib, watchdogs and irate members of Congress. Janis Karpinski, the former brigadier general who was demoted after the Abu Ghraib scandal, describes how private contractors were involved in some of the interrogations at the prison without proper supervision. Others contend that at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, untrained and incompetent translators were hired (by San Diego's Titan), a practice that is alleged to have cost lives. Major contracts were granted without competitive bidding, which amounts to a legal way of stealing, says one whistle-blower. Other scams include charging the government for runs by empty cargo trucks and using a cost-plus billing system that encourages profligate spending. One ex-Halliburton employee accuses the company of providing contaminated water to the military. There are stories of $45-per-six-pack sodas and soldiers' laundry washed at $100 a load. Part of the problem is the much-lamented Pentagon revolving door: Companies hired by the military are often staffed and run by ex-military. Even at the nonexecutive level, the situation is eye-opening: While soldiers make $3,000 a month, private consultants, doing similar work, can pull in six figures a year. There's no objectivity in this film -- Greenwald's goal is not to offer balanced coverage but to roil the waters. It should also be said that most of the charges aired here have been reported before. But Greenwald is skillful enough to spark a fresh sense of outrage. -- Walter Addiego Documentary. Directed by Ian Inaba. With Cynthia McKinney, Greg Palast, Christopher Edley Jr., John Conyers Jr., Stephanie Tubbs-Jones. (Not rated. 95 minutes. At Opera Plaza; Lark Theater in Larkspur.) When watching American Blackout, prepare to get depressed, or mad, or both, depending on how you feel about the outcomes of the last two presidential elections. Assisted by 95 minutes of damning evidence, filmmaker Ian Inaba (director of Eminem's 2004 get-out-the-vote video Mosh) argues that African American voters are being systematically disenfranchised from the political process, beginning with the 2000 election debacle in Florida. At the same time, Inaba charges government and media alike with orchestrating the political lynching of U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney when the outspoken Georgia Democrat began asking too many questions about the Bush administration's Iraq policy, election machinations and culpability in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. While this might sound like the stuff of chronic conspiracy theory -- a charge some have used to marginalize McKinney -- some provocative facts are out there for those willing to dig. Inaba takes a straightforward approach to his work with an unadorned style that narrates through interviews and archival footage, an approach that, in this case, proves more convincing than the directorial theatrics favored by some new-school documentarians. To his credit, Inaba doesn't try to feign objectivity. He's biased, thank you very much, and he does a good job of showing why. American Blackout makes a credible case, with some of its most damning evidence coming from the mouths of the conservatives themselves. The film is ultimately as much an indictment of liberal apathy as of conservative dirty dealing, and a canonization of McKinney for her continued refusal to follow any party's party line. -- Neva Chonin Mystery. Directed by Marc Rosenbush. With Duane Sharp, Debra Miller, Kim Chan, Ezra Buzzington. (Not rated. 71 minutes. At the Lumiere.) From Brick to Hollywoodland and everything in between, directors are retooling film noir and adapting its aesthetic for new contexts. The latest entry into nouveau noir is Marc Rosenbush's Zen Noir, a stagy mystery about life and death and the meaning of everything. Why do I talk this way? a nameless gumshoe (Duane Sharp) wonders in an early scene, having just spouted a bizarre string of Raymond Chandler-speak to his mirror. By film's end, he'll be wondering at a lot more -- his lack of a name, for instance, and the nature of death, and the proper way to eat an orange -- when a case involving murder in a Buddhist temple turns out to be a bigger mystery than expected. The biggest mystery of all is why director Marc Rosenbush, whose background is in theater, bothered putting this story on film when it's so obviously meant for a stage. Comedic scenes patter along like experimental skits riffing on old who's-on-first shtick. As the central character, Sharp overacts every line, as if projecting to some unseen peanut gallery; camerawork is rudimentary, composition is static and self-conscious. For all its shortcomings, Zen Noir still entertains. Lynchian dream sequences involving the detective's late wife add needed dynamics, and Debra Miller is serene and inscrutable as a bald femme fatale with a big secret. Kim Chan turns what might have been a cliche into an arresting performance as the requisite wise Zen master who helps the gumshoe down the path of enlightenment. Maybe he should throw in acting lessons, too. -- Neva Chonin ",1
"'LOST SOULS' Horror. Starring Winona Ryder, Ben Chaplin. Directed by Janusz Kaminski. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). . But with Winona Ryder and Ben Chaplin (The Truth About Cats & Dogs) starring, Oscar-winning cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List) directing and Meg Ryan producing, it probably seemed a shame to ship it straight to video. Plus, with The Exorcist raking in bucks, why not ride the Mephistophelian wave? Ryder plays a formerly possessed woman who now helps priests perform exorcisms. She decodes an agitated message from a possessed fel low that leads her to Peter Kelson, a crime writer played by Chaplin. Kelson also might be the devil's new human vessel, having met a few of the requirements -- he was never baptized and is a child of incest. Chaplin is a bit stiff in reacting to these extraordinary developments. Maybe the British actor was concentrating too hard on his American accent. Ryder is as believable as the faulty script allows. Lost Souls doesn't have enough jolts, unless you count the choppy editing. Some scenes are awkwardly truncated, and a few key plot details seem to have been excised. There's some black runny stuff and the occasional cockroach -- scary for clean freaks but not truly Luciferous. The ending attempts to tug at the heartstrings, but we don't want real human connection in this kind of film. We want to see Winona spider-walk down the stairs. Even a badly executed horror movie can achieve cheesy greatness. This one, unfortunately, is too somber for that. It's artfully shot -- to be expected with Kaminski as director -- with everything bathed in green and golden light. The set designers should be commended for their fine choice in lamps -- from Tiffany to Deco, they're fabulous, even in the priests' quarters. But when the furniture stands out more than the story, the movie's a stinker. -- This film contains violence. -- Carla Meyer  Comedy. Starring Tim Meadows, Karyn Parsons, Billy Dee Williams. Directed by Reginald Hudlin. (R. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Prudes had better stay away from The Ladies Man, an unblushing sex farce often so raw it might make even fairly open-minded people feel a bit uncomfortable. But they'll probably be laughing too hard to notice. Tim Meadows has adapted his Saturday Night Live sex-advice routine to feature-film length and cranked up the stakes considerably for what is perhaps the most risque movie of the season, at least in terms of language. It's a guilty pleasure -- but save it for a bargain matinee. Meadows plays Leon Phelps, the love advice radio-show host obsessed with sex. He gives outrageous suggestions, going out of his way to shock callers. Although he has made love with hundreds of women, he hardly even notices his trusty producer, Julie (Karyn Parsons of TV's The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air), a stunning beauty. Decked out in '70s flash and a short Afro hair style, Leon is determined to set off alarms on the meter of political correctness. But as down and dirty as he gets, Meadows is a grinning comic actor with wonderful way of wrapping his trash in infectious joie de vivre. The love expert gets fired for being too frank. He has trouble landing another job. A stretch he gets with a Christian station is a riot. He believes his luck will change when a former lover identifying herself only as sweet thing begs him to return to her -- and her millions. But Leon has another problem. A bunch of angry husbands are after his hide for his having seduced their wives. Lee Evans and SNL star Will Ferrell are featured as the offended husbands. Ferrell's bit as a Greco-Roman Olympic wrestler named Lance is a tickle. -- This movie contains explicit sexual language, some nudity. -- Peter Stack  Drama. Starring Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle Seigner. Directed by Nicole Garcia. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 117 minutes. At the Clay, Albany, and Guild, Menlo Park. Opens Oct. 20 at the Rafael Film Center.) Catherine Deneuve brings smoldering dignity even to her part as an alcoholic wife in Place Vendome, a taut intrigue set in the rarefied world of diamond trading in the most prestigious jewelry shopping district of Paris. Place Vendome, directed by Nicole Garcia, is in French with English subtitles. Fortunately, Deneuve's unhappy character, Marianne, wife of a famed diamond merchant (Bernard Fresson), is able to come to terms with her drinking problems when she's suddenly widowed. Her life changes dramatically after she stumbles upon a cache of extremely rare stones the husband had hidden. But possessing those diamonds -- stolen from Russian mafioso -- makes her an outlaw in her elegant world. The jewelry firm carrying her husband's name has a tarnished reputation, and Marianne makes other discoveries. Not the least is her late husband's relationship with his best saleswoman, the beautiful young Nathalie (Emmanuelle Seigner). This look at a middle-aged woman determined to recover self-reliance and a sense of purpose is also a shadowy thriller. At the core is her curious, protective relationship with Nathalie, and with a former lover (Jacques Dutronc) who turns out to be a major threat among the businessmen/predators. Marianne sees the stones as her only bargaining chips for her future. This film is dark and a little slow but consistently absorbing as the amazing Deneuve reveals, scene by scene, new facets of a fascinating character in a mercantile war that involves equal parts greed and vanity. The supporting is cast is superb, especially Jean-Pierre Bacri as a mysterious but sexy secret agent who befriends both women. -- Peter Stack One is a somber and original film set in San Francisco, not the yuppie San Francisco of decaf venti lattes, but the blue-collar, hardscrabble city of Tenderloin walk-ups and seedy pool halls. Directed and co-written by Tony Barbieri, it tells a high-stakes story in a quiet way. Jason Cairns plays Charlie, who is paroled after doing time for a violent crime. He goes to live in the basement of his best friend's parents' house, and the friend, Nick (Kane Picoy), gets him a job at the sanitation department. The picture, the latest in the Shooting Gallery series, is a study in character. Charlie has come out of prison with a vague hunger to make something special of his life. Forced to do community service as part of his parole, he finds that he likes working with disabled kids. He also likes his boss, Sara (Autumn McIntosh), who becomes his girlfriend. Nick, by contrast, has a natural talent for baseball, but his bad temper and laziness threaten to keep him from ever making it. For a long while the movie looks like it might be the usual story of one friend drag ging the other one down. But Barbieri throws the audience a big, fat curve near the finish, which casts everything in a new light. The film's sober mood is enforced by Barbieri's camera work, which perceives the action from a cold distance. The distance is a little too cold. He shoots some scenes from outside doorways. In one scene, over the course of a long shot, he switches focus from two people in bed to an ashtray in the foreground, so that throughout the whole middle and end of the conversation, the actors are in a blur. There may be a reason for that shot, but it isn't good enough. Still, such affectations can be overlooked in a film so visceral and strong. -- This film contains strong language. -- Mick LaSalle  Drama. Starring Paul Hipp, Boyd Kestner, Bitty Schram and Radha Mitchell. Directed and written by Jon Reiss. (Rated R. 91 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Emotional abuse and scalding revenge are the subject of Cleopatra's Second Husband, an unpleasant drama from Jon Reiss, a music video veteran whose documentary, Better Living Through Circuitry, played earlier this year. It's a bitter pill to swallow, featuring a quartet of unsympathetic characters and an unrelenting air of misanthropy. A few shards of dark humor would've been nice to relieve the gloom -- the kind we saw in Shallow Grave orHappiness -- but Reiss keeps it on a steady note of nastiness. Robert (Paul Hipp), a depressed photographer, is married to the nagging, materialistic Hallie (Bitty Schram). After they return from a month's vacation and find that their house sitters, Zack and Sophie (Boyd Kestner and Radha Mitchell), have trashed the house and let the tropical fish die, the stage is set for a Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? reversal. Instead of hosts terrorizing guests, it's the interlopers making hell for Robert and Hallie. Sophie seduces Robert and Zack bullies him until his self-respect is ripped to shreds. Hallie splits, then Sophie, leaving the men to engage in a duet of psychological torture. It's hard to feel much for Robert -- a guy who photographs the maggots crawling on road kill -- or to understand how he came to be so passive and dull. Even in the last reel, when he turns the tables on Zack and metes out a spectacularly cruel but proper punishment, he's the same blank, joyless twerp. -- This film contains rough language, partial nudity, sexual situations and violence. -- Edward Guthmann  ..

"'La Vie Promise' Drama. Starring Isabelle Huppert, Pascal Greggory and Maud Forget. Directed by Olivier Dahan. (Not rated. 96 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) Huppert plays Sylvia, a blond streetwalker with blue nail polish and silver lipstick, who lives a squalid, substance-abusing existence. When her abandoned daughter (Maud Forget) shows up out of nowhere one afternoon, she tries to make the girl go away. But that night, as Sylvia is getting worked over by a pair of gangsters, the daughter emerges from a side room holding a kitchen knife. Perhaps confusing her mother with Lana Turner, the daughter kills one of the attackers, whereupon mother and daughter hit the road. La Vie Promise is the story of their travels, together and separately, as Sylvia tries to locate the husband and child she abandoned years before. Along the way they meet Joshua, a mature man who is also running from something. He's played by Pascal Greggory, whose silence and intensity match Huppert's. Extreme passion and inherent dignity -- Huppert brings her essential screen qualities to bear on Sylvia, a woman who blocks emotion yet feels it, who runs from the past yet seeks it. To watch the war play out in Huppert's eyes is the principal allure of La Vie Promise. Another pleasure is in contemplating Huppert/Sylvia in all her contained, complex selfhood. Like Garbo, Huppert has a way of looking at people that's both opaque and expressive. Sylvia may show nothing to the characters with whom she shares the frame, but Huppert shows everything to us, and it's fascinating. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language (in subtitles), violence and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle Documentary. Directed by Chris Relleke and Jascha de Wilde. (Not rated. 77 minutes. In Hindi, Nepali and English, with subtitles. At the Roxie.) It has been 11 years since Mary Ellen Mark published Indian Circus, her book of stunning black-and-white photos that document life behind the scenes of India's great circuses. In the preface to that book, Mark described what she'd witnessed on the subcontinent, using words like beautiful, sad, cruel and always human. The documentary Starkiss: Circus Girls in India is all these things and more. The sadness and cruelty are obvious from the start: The girls are there because their poor parents sold them to the circus for a few hundred dollars. Though the girls can theoretically leave after their contracts expire (usually in five years), they get used to the regimen of circus life, which includes working long hours, performing difficult feats and remaining segregated from the male performers. The girls can't even walk around the grounds without permission. And yet it seems a better existence than being a prostitute (a comparison that's made several times in on-camera interviews) or other work that's dangerous and demeaning. The beauty and humanity in Starkiss come from the relationships between workers. A motorcycle stuntwoman teaches some of them how to read and write. The girls have an abiding love for the circus' smallest performer -- a teenage boy who talks with an Alvin and the Chipmunks voice and is so minuscule that he fits into a purse. One 17-year-old girl talks about her romantic interest (complete with notes passed back and forth) in a clown named Ravi. They all yearn for personal connections. Unlike Mark's Indian Circus, Starkiss focuses on just one circus, the Great Rayman Circus, which its owner says is the oldest in India. He gets many of the girls from Nepal. (The male workers all seem to be from India.) They're paid obscenely low wages. One girl says she gets the equivalent of $2.06 a month to do her three-times-a-day performances. Starkiss takes its name from an act that requires girls to bite the end of a rope that twists them around and around in the air. Starkiss spotlights disturbing conditions in which circus workers have much in common with animals that are let out of their cages only for performances. Yet the Great Rayman workers say they need the circus; one dwarf admits he would have killed himself had he not been hired. Starkiss tries to be sympathetic to their situation. It leaves the audience to draw its own conclusions. -- Jonathan Curiel Documentary. Directed by Jon Long. Written by Long and Karen Fernandez Long. Narrated by Robert Redford. (Rated PG. 45 minutes. At the IMAX Theater, Metreon.) Sacred Planet offers a primer of images we've seen before in nature and in ethnographic photographs and films -- herds of galloping giraffes and gazelles, Southwestern cliff dwellings, a temple in Thailand with a giant Buddha, old-growth forests in British Columbia, time-lapse depictions of cloud formations, glistening schools of fish in blue waters. But this isn't just another show on the Animal Planet network. The sights may be familiar, but they gain an impressive new dimension from the large- screen IMAX format -- when we see the Grand Canyon or Monument Valley here, we get some sense of just how grand and monumental they really are. The movie is all the more remarkable because filmmakers Jon Long and Karen Fernandez Long had to transport the cumbersome IMAX cameras and other heavy equipment (including 30-foot cranes) along with crews of as many as 40 people to remote locations like the rain forests of Borneo. Presented by Walt Disney, Sacred Planet is narrated partly by Robert Redford, who puts on his best Conscience of the Environment voice to deliver an easy-to-digest message that says we're all children of the Earth and ought to live in harmony with it. Other voiceovers are spoken by members of various indigenous cultures whose traditional lifestyles we are encouraged to emulate. It all plays out against a score with New Age/world music overtones. With its 45-minute run time (dictated at least partially by the expense of making IMAX pictures), its gently delivered theme and friendly images of nature (no lions eating antelopes here), this is a fine thing for families and school groups. -- Walter Addiego ",1
"'Mostly Martha' Comedy-drama. Starring Martina Gedeck and Sergio Castellitto. Directed by Sandra Nettelbeck. (PG. 107 minutes. In German with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) This little gem from Germany stars Martina Gedeck as Martha, a woman who is so clipped and forbidding that it takes five or 10 minutes to notice that she's quite beautiful. Martha is not neurotic, just seriously Teutonic. What she needs in her life, but neither knows it nor wants it, is an Italian guy who can make great pasta and sing while doing it. The Italian arrives in the form of a gentle, manly sous chef named Mario (Italian star Sergio Castellitto), whom Martha finds immediately threatening. But then, she's under stress anyway, having recently assumed temporary custody of her niece as a result of a family tragedy. The wonder of Mostly Martha is the performance of Gedeck, who makes Martha enormously endearing by letting us gradually come to understand that her strong front is a gallant bluff. Underneath, she is a basket case of vulnerability and insecurity, but Martha never wallows in that basket. As a result, she's someone to admire. She's also funny. In one scene, she walks into her kitchen, where Mario has prepared their dinner, and sees a mess of dirty pots and spilled sauce. She starts hyperventilating. The sensuousness of food has become a movie cliche -- kind of like intellectuals rhapsodizing about baseball -- but Mostly Martha reclaims the cliche by not overplaying it. It's a movie that can make audiences walk out both randy and hungry, and, so as not to confuse one's priorities, it might be best to have dinner before seeing it. -- Mick LaSalle Romantic comedy. Starring Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Reginald Hudlin. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Matthew Perry goes through the romantic comedy Serving Sara needing a shave, with his hair standing up and his eyes looking dead. He looks as if he slept all night on a park bench, and he acts surly and bitter, as if he hadn't slept well. Normally a likable actor, he gives about as charmless a performance as possible, as though getting paid to kiss Elizabeth Hurley were a really lousy job. Perry isn't the only thing wrong with Serving Sara, but he's the thing that takes a pleasantly mediocre movie and turns it into an unpleasantly mediocre one. He plays Joe, a process server who hands divorce papers to a Texas cattleman's wife (Hurley) -- then switches sides and agrees to work as a process server on her behalf. It's a romp, or it's intended to be: Lots of locations, lots of silly adventures and, along the way, a romance. Hurley demonstrates, as usual, her comic timing, but most of the gags are Perry's. In the course of his job, Joe assumes various identities, but Perry's comic efforts are halfhearted. He seems almost embarrassed to be trying to act funny, and so it becomes embarrassing to watch him. It's a sure sign that something is wrong when the movie sets up a rivalry between Joe and another process server (Vincent Pastore), and the rival emerges as more sympathetic. It's also a bad sign when the funniest actor is in a minor role. The comedian Cedric the Entertainer plays Joe's greedy boss and has the right spirit -- over the top, silly and generous. According to reports, Perry went into rehab for two months during the making of Serving Sara. Coincidence? Maybe. He does look better at the end of the movie than at the beginning, but since films are rarely shot in sequence, it's hard to know what to make of that. If anything. . This film contains crude humor and sexual content. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Lauren Ambrose, Joelle Carter, Jennifer Dundas Lowe. Directed by Robert J. Siegel. (Not rated. 98 minutes. At Opera Plaza). When Josee (Joelle Carter), waitress, drifter and all-around good-time gal, struts into a beach-town diner, it's clear she's about to lay waste to the hearts around her. Sinuous and supremely self-assured, she's a classic movie vixen, and director Robert J. Siegel knows to give her the proper entrance. The character veers from archetype, however, in the triangle she creates, one that concerns two other young women and friendship more than lust. Though there's some of that, too. Keenly observed and refreshingly natural, Swimming gets the details right, from its promenade of barely clad bodies in Myrtle Beach, S.C., to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner. This film, sort of a Ruby in Paradise with more erotic intrigue, might have been lost -- it was made in 2000 -- did it not star Lauren Ambrose, Claire from HBO's Six Feet Under. Ambrose brings the same detached hopefulness she shows on Six Feet to the role of Frankie, a college-age woman running the coffee shop with her older brother. The actress' face lights up with pure wonder when Frankie spies Josee (Frankie and Josee, get it?). She's got a crush, as does her brother and half the town. You can see the appeal. Josee's exotic (having been to Hawaii) and pays attention to what Frankie says, often touching her hand for a little longer than is polite. In contrast, Frankie's longtime best friend (Jennifer Dundas Lowe), a hellion and professional body piercer, is less than fully engaged with Frankie. The friend is attentive enough to see a threat in Josee, however, and scenes of the three together are studies in complex female friendship. Frankie's new friend and her old one are natural adversaries, since each is invested in being the light of her life. But the old friend can't compete with the newcomer's whiff of sexual intrigue. Dundas Lowe, a New York stage actress who played Diane Keaton's lesbian daughter in The First Wives' Club, gives the standout performance here, turning her spitfire role into something uncliched. The character might be ornery and jealous, but the actress lends her an undercurrent of true devotion and a sense of betrayal that really stings. As Josee, Carter seems too reserved at first, but then again, the quiet ones often are the most insinuating. She gives the character a who, me? disingenuousness, mixed with genuine affection for Frankie. That Josee shows similar affection for most men in town is another story. . This film contains raw language, sexual situations. -- Carla Meyer 1927 science-fiction drama. Starring Brigitte Helm and Gustav Frohlich. Directed by Fritz Lang. (Not rated. 120 minutes. At the Castro.) Fritz Lang's Metropolis is back. What, that old thing? Well, no, not exactly. If you've seen Metropolis on video or at the movies, even in a restoration, you've seen a butchered print. The film, originally released at more than two hours, has existed for decades in a variety of versions, all of them topping out at about 90 minutes. But not this Metropolis. This new incarnation, the work of a consortium of German archives, runs a full two hours long and uses every scrap of available footage, and from the best possible sources. Digitally restored, cleaned up and given an imposing orchestral soundtrack, the newest Metropolis may still be shy of the original's running time (approximately 135 minutes), but it's the longest, fullest version that anyone has seen since its Berlin premiere 75 years ago. Seeing it is a time-bending experience, a way of visiting the past and glimpsing the past's idea of the future. A masterpiece of art direction, the movie has influenced our vision of the future ever since, with its imposing white monoliths and starched facades. In Metropolis, the upper class inhabits the city's surface, while workers, held in little better than slave conditions, live and work in underground mines. Brigitte Helm plays a saintly figure named Maria who rallies the workers and acts on their behalf. But she is imprisoned by the ruling powers, and a replica robot Maria is sent down to the mines to incite the workers to a self- destructive riot. Since its premiere, the movie's unsettling vision has been open to a variety of interpretations. It can be seen as a warning against fascist tyranny, communist oppression or capitalism run amok. Yet, in a way, the most rewarding way to see it is not as a prescient work, but as a film very much of its time, a missive from an age of anxiety. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Evan Rachel Wood, Michael Angarano, David Gallagher and Vivica A. Fox. Directed by Blair Treu. Written by Jessica Barondes. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Little Secrets, a smart, teenage violinist named Emily (Evan Rachel Wood) has the talent and discipline to be a world-class musician. Her life seems perfect. Surrounded by caring parents, she lives in a bucolic suburb, has many friends and -- in her spare time, as a way of offering a service she never had as a kid -- runs a 50-cent booth where neighborhood children can come and unburden themselves of secrets. When a family moves next door and Emily learns the eldest son (David Gallagher) was involved in a drunken-driving accident, she takes an extreme view of him, even though they initially liked each other. At the end of Little Secrets, we learn why Emily was so upset and why keeping a secret can exact a toll on everyone involved. There's no denying that director Blair Treu has made a touching film that will make audiences smile and cry at young characters who are learning about love and confession. This movie is ideal for families who want to explore the meaning of secrets and friendship, and for anyone interested in a sweet story of a violinist determined to make her youth orchestra. The plot twists in Little Secrets sustain the movie when it gets a bit too schmaltzy. This excess of cuteness and sentimentality won't be a flaw to moviegoers in the mood for it. -- Jonathan Curiel Comedy. Starring Nassim Abdi, Cyrus Abidi. Directed and written by Babak Payami. (Not rated. In Farsi with English subtitles. 105 minutes. At the Lumiere and Rafael). Secret Ballot, an absurdist comedy from Iran, pokes fun at the country's undemocratic process. The film's satire, though mild by American standards, has kept it from being released at home. Which just goes to show that subversive is highly subjective. The best comedy, however, is universal, and Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny. Scenes that should be zany unfold so slowly, so thoughtfully, that comic momentum goes bust. The deliberate pacing works initially, when writer-director Babak Payami sets the scene at a beachfront military post. The camera lingers on two soldiers during a shift change, one replacing the other on a lone cot, and gives a sense of a place where nothing ever happens. Except this day is election day, and the guard on duty (Cyrus Abidi) must escort an election worker trying to collect votes in the remote area. The gruff, lunkheaded guy scoffs when he discovers that the worker is a woman (Nassim Abdi), a city girl who shows a bit of ankle beneath her chador. In setting up a mismatched couple, Payami attempts a Hepburn-Tracy feel, and he gives the pair's exchanges some verve. Idealistic and officious, the woman talks of how every vote can lead to change. The soldier counters that the rifle strapped to his back has much more influence. As the pair scour the countryside for voters, Payami comments on political and social inequities. A 12-year-old girl tries to vote but cannot, though she can legally marry. A group of would-be voters travels miles to the ballot box, only to find none of their candidates on the official list. Unfortunately, every long, long setup leads to a similarly bittersweet punch line. Payami recruited nonactors for the two lead roles, and and one of them remains a nonactor. Stocky and expressionless, Abidi is convincing as a lug but lacks the range to show this guy's glimmers of enlightenment. A movie this luxuriously paced needed an actor with oomph to balance it. His co-star, Abdi, however is a natural: Cocky and wet behind the ears, she's the perfect candidate for a dose of reality. -- Carla Meyer ",1
"'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' .  Comedy. Starring Nia Vardalos, John Corbett and Michael Constantine. Directed by Joel Zwick. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The title gives much of the story away. At the start, Toula (Vardalos) is a 30-year-old woman working in her father's Greek restaurant. She wears frumpy housedresses and eyeglasses with unflattering plastic frames, of the kind Maria Callas used to wear. Her ticket to independence is a job in her aunt's travel agency, where her looks blossom and she gets to meet the man of her dreams, Ian (John Corbett of HBO's Sex and the City). Soon everyone is planning . . . a big, fat Greek wedding. The joy of this movie is in the details, which are specific and authentic to the Greek experience -- the foods, the personalities, the customs. For example, as the bride walks up the aisle, the older relatives make as if they're spitting at her. The spitting is to make her unappealing, so the devil will stay away. The picture provides vivid roles for talented veteran actors, such as Michael Constantine as Gus, Toula's father, whose first lines in the movie are, You better get married soon. You starting to look old. Lainie Kazan plays Toula's bighearted mom, and Andrea Martin has fun as Aunt Voula, who, when told that Ian is a vegetarian, answers, That's OK. I make lamb. Meanwhile, Vardalos, an unknown until now, emerges as effortlessly funny and appealing. It's a strange thing about stories that are specific and true. Somehow, in their truth, they become universal. With a few changes, My Big Fat Greek Wedding could be the story of any family in which people eat well, get loud and carry on.  Documentary about the Space Station, narrated by Tom Cruise. Directed by Toni Myers. (Not rated. 47 minutes. At Metreon.) . The latest IMAX movie is as technically impressive as other films bearing the IMAX name. It has the usual amazing depth of field and laserlike clarity. Yet it fails to enchant for a reason that might not be fair, but that's just how it is: We've seen outer space simulated so well in sci-fi movies that the real thing seems like old stuff. Filmed at the Space Station, as it orbits the earth, the documentary mainly allows us to witness the novelty of weightlessness. We see a man who, while shaving, lets his razor go, only to have it wait for him in midair until he retrieves it. We also see spacemen conducting experiments outside the station, in the black yonder, where it looks as lonely as an Elton John song. Yet ultimately these weightlessness scenes grow tiresome. Outer-space buffs might love this film, but others will find its pleasures intermittent. The picture -- narrated by Tom Cruise, with his usual engaging enthusiasm -- tells the story of the station, being built somewhere out in the great emptiness by international teams of energetic, down-to-earth geniuses from all over the world, especially Russia and the United States. The people are appealing. They love what they do. They are like kids with huge IQs and big biceps. The best thing in the film, which goes by too quickly and is filmed incompletely, is the scene of the takeoff from inside the space capsule. IMAX, more than any other medium, is capable of rendering that vicarious thrill, of re-creating the sights and sounds and vibrations of breaking through the Earth's atmosphere. With such an unprecedented tool in hand, the movie could and should have given us the whole experience, from countdown to orbit. Instead we only get an exhilarating 30 seconds of it. . -- Mick LaSalle  Mockumentary. Starring Jerry Stiller, Janeane Garofalo. Directed by Stephen Kessler. (R. 85 minutes. At the Lumiere.). . Jerry Stiller, a screamer and eye-popper, is a talent best appreciated in small doses, as fans of TV's Seinfeld and King of Queens can attest. Playing a schlock director on the skids, Stiller appears in nearly every scene of The Independent, but that shouldn't put people off. The movie tempers his abrasiveness with Janeane Garofalo's reliable deadpan stylings and with a sometimes uproarious lowlights reel from the D-movie auteur's career. Stiller even pulls the heartstrings on occasion. Director Stephen Kessler, who wrote the mockumentary with fellow Stanford alum Mike Wilkins, doesn't take the easy way out by making Stiller's character a misguided sweetheart a la Ed Wood. Instead, he's an egomaniac who frittered away his marriage and fortune while making the overblown vanity project The Whole History of the World. He's about to lose everything unless he accepts the bank's offer to buy his 420-film catalog -- by the pound. Garofalo, wary but indulgent as the director's estranged daughter, has great comic rapport with Stiller. Their joy in working together shows, even if their improvising sometimes seems stiff. Stiller softens in Garofalo's presence, and we can see why the daughter still loves the lout. After all, it's hard to fault a dad who avenges his child's rejection by the cheerleading squad with a movie called Cheerleader Massacre. The Independent really is just an excuse to string together some silly fake-movie clips, ranging from inspired (Eco-Angels, in which pneumatic '70s environmental activists clean up the earth by day and shower with bikers by night) to insipid (Bald Justice, where the heroes are thinning). Sometimes the clips are so good you want to see the whole fake film.  Family drama. Starring Rodrigo Santoro. Directed by Walter Salles. Written by Salles, Sergio Machado and Karim Ainouz. (Rated PG-13. 94 minutes. In Portuguese with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . In the desert of northeastern Brazil, a blood feud escalates between two families, turning young men into martyrs for an absurd cause. It's like two snakes I saw fighting, says one observer. Each one was biting the tail of the other; they ate each other until nothing was left. Directed by Walter Salles (Central Station), Behind the Sun is a powerful allegory about family violence and the struggle of two young brothers to break the cycle. Exquisitely photographed by Walter Carvalho, Behind the Sun is a gorgeous film with the timeless, elemental qualities of Greek tragedy and the Bible. Two brothers, Tonho (Rodrigo Santoro) and Pacu (Ravi Ramos Lacerda), live in a tiny, sun-baked outpost called Stream-of-Souls. Their embittered father (Jose Dumont) grows sugarcane and forces his sons to work as hard as the oxen that power the cane mill. For Tonho, who has the martyred-angel look of Terence Stamp in Billy Budd,  it's a particularly cruel destiny. Forced to avenge the family's honor after his older brother's death, he stalks the son of the rival clan and in a brilliantly directed sequence chases him through cane fields and shoots him without breaking his pace. Tonho is marked to die, as soon as the blood on the dead man's shirt turns yellow, but when a two-person circus rides through town and he falls for the beautiful acrobat (Flavia Marco Antonio), Tonho discovers the possibility of joy and fulfillment beyond his world. Salles is a fine director with the ability to invest moments with a sense of tragedy and inexorable fate. He's good with actors, particularly children, and draws a great performance from Lacerda as young Pacu. Mournful but brave, with expressive, world-weary eyes, he's a heartbreaker.  Comedy. Starring James Nesbitt and Olivia Williams. Directed by Peter Cattaneo. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Lucky Break is a pleasing but routine British comedy set in an English prison. It has the advantage of a leading man in James Nesbitt, who has the good looks and offhand charm of an Irish George Clooney. But it has nothing else to raise it above the ordinary. Indeed, Lucky Break is such a standard-issue product that it's the third British movie in the past year (Borstal Boy and Greenfingers are the others) to feature the same three plot elements: (1) A handsome guy goes to a prison that seems more like a men's club, (2) he escapes (or leaves) but then comes back and (3) he gets romantically involved with an attractive woman affiliated with the prison hierarchy. From these movies, it would seem prison is a great way to meet girls. Why escape? Lucky Break also tries to catch some of the reflected shimmer of The Full Monty. Like Monty, Lucky Break was directed by Peter Cattaneo and centers on an unlikely group of men preparing to put on a stage show. Here the men are rehearsing a musical, Nelson, written by the show-tune-besotted warden, played by Christopher Plummer. The musical scenes, which should pay off in a big comedic way, are only mildly diverting because the songs in Nelson aren't all that different from the kind heard on Broadway. It's hard to parody a parody. Also detracting from the comedy is the fact that these ungainly performers aren't really trying to do their best. Rather, they're building an elaborate escape plan around the opening performance of Nelson. Since they have no investment in the performance, we have no kick in watching them fail. In the end, the only thing left to care about is the love story between the charming bank robber (Nesbitt) and the prison social worker (Olivia Williams). They're a handsome couple, and we wish them all the best. ",1
"'New Suit'  Hollywood satire. Starring Jordan Bridges, Marisa Coughlan and Dan Hedaya. Directed by Francois Velle. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jordan Bridges (grandson of Lloyd Bridges) plays Kevin, a nice guy who arrives in Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a screenwriter. He meets fellow aspirant Marianne (Marisa Coughlan), one of those lucky and slightly twisted people born with an innate understanding of how the Hollywood game is played. She's going places. Within a year, she's climbing the ladder as a talent agent, while he's adrift as a script reader for a midlevel producer. The satire kicks into gear when, at a lunch with some fellow readers from other companies, Kevin pretends to have read a brilliant new script, New Suit,  by a writer named Jordan Strawberry. His fellow readers pretend to have read it themselves, and from there word spreads throughout the industry. Soon every producer wants to buy the script, and rival producers are afraid their competitors will make the deal first. Marianne poses as Strawberry's agent and plans to ride New Suit to wealth and power. The movie makes fun of a Hollywood in which no one reads and everyone pretends to be connected. Everyone claims to have a close personal relationship with the fictional Strawberry, and all the Hollywood players find it entirely reasonable to be bidding over a screenplay they have never seen. As in The Emperor's New Clothes, no one will admit that he hasn't seen it. And so the frenzy is fueled by lies on top of lies. Although New Suit is not in the same league as The Big Picture or The Player, classics of the Hollywood satire genre, it's funny and has an interesting edge of bitterness to it. It has both the limits and virtues of an outsider's perspective. Writer Craig Sherman and Francois Velle don't seem to completely know the ins and outs, but they do know enough to be disgusted.-- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, drug use and strong language.-- Mick LaSalle  Drama. Starring Javier Bardem and Jose Angel Egido. Directed by Fernando Leon de Aranoa. (R. 115 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The film is about the degradation of unemployment -- indeed, the tragedy of it -- the horror of a man's having to watch his wife go off every morning to work 12 hours in a factory, the embarrassment of applying for a loan with no collateral. It's about 50-year-old men dyeing their hair to look younger on job interviews. It's a film of vivid moments and images, but the narrative, almost of necessity, is static. And so, alas, midway, Mondays in the Sun becomes as dull as a day with nothing to do. Director and co-writer Fernando Leon de Aranoa paints himself into a corner. If he gives in to the need for a story line and concocts some kind of forward motion for these fellows, he betrays the point he's trying to make. Yet if he stays true to his vision and honest about his subject, absolutely nothing can happen. This is the challenge of making a movie about stasis. Moving pictures and stasis do not make for a felicitous combination. So we take what we can from the experience: Bardem lying on his bed, staring at the cracked ceiling of a boarding-house room. The sight of this proud, physical man handing out leaflets no one will take. The anger that expresses itself in petty rebellion -- a man's refusing to pay for a ferry ride or eating food in a supermarket and not paying for it. About every 10 minutes, there are 10 great seconds, but the rest is sitting around waiting. At least these poor fellows have an excuse -- they're bored because their lives are boring. But to plunk down money to actually watch guys be bored -- that would constitute an admission of idleness far beyond anything depicted in the movie.-- Advisory: This film contains strong language and sexual references. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Pinero' Biopic. Starring Benjamin Bratt, Talisa Soto, Rita Moreno, Mandy Patinkin. Directed by Leon Ichaso. (R. 95 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Puerto Rico-born Pinero, a heroin addict and petty thief who turned his life around with the prison play Short Eyes, died homeless at age 41 in 1988, almost whimsically searching for a liver transplant. He knew he didn't stand a chance. Such a brief description doesn't do justice to the man's life, but Bratt's performance does. He understands that in spite of everything Pinero went through, he never lost his love of life. The meaty role is a breakthrough for the actor and a wonderful thing for an audience to share. Bratt is probably best known for the television series Law & Order and light comedies such as Miss Congeniality, to say nothing of his former relationship with Julia Roberts. Pinero was many things to different people -- You look familiar. Which one are you tonight? says a loyal, long-suffering friend. Put-on artist, charmer, hustler, stoned lover, inspired writer, actor on- and offstage -- he was a man who knew that his bad habits would kill him but nonetheless accepted his place outside society. He wasn't surprised when things turned sour. His writing made it worth it all. It's a big challenge for any actor, and when Pinero is over, it's hard to think of any other actor in the role. The Leon Ichaso film is not merely a showcase for Bratt. Ichaso (Sugar Hill, Crossover Dreams) captures a dislocated era, from the '70s through the late '80s, in dislocated images that jump back and forth in time, and from color to black-and-white. One virtuoso shot compares a syringe to the tower of the Empire State Building. Unexpected faces show up in supporting roles -- most memorably, Rita Moreno as Pinero's mother. Mandy Patinkin does a soulfully gruff turn as theater producer Joseph Papp. Talisa Soto plays Sugar, a prostitute and Pinero's lover, as well as playing the actress who portrays the same character onstage in one of the playwright's works. When the drugged-out Pinero can't get it on in bed, she taunts him, I guess it's true what they say about jail. She's half right -- he was bisexual, which is made clear, briefly, with another of his lovers. Bratt nails the everyday street jive but also delivers Pinero's poetry -- at the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe that Pinero helped create and during a rooftop film shoot -- with such involvement that the words seem to be occurring to him on the spot. -- Bob Graham Teen romance. Starring Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah. Directed by Adam Shankman. (PG. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). This one's a real surprise. Adam Shankman's A Walk to Remember is a movie for teenagers, and, as these things go, very entertaining. But it is more than that, and its appeal should spread well beyond the fans of its two young stars, Shane West and Mandy Moore. At a time when many Hollywood products portray adults as not terribly bright children, here is a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously. It is also beautifully acted. This Walk will be tough to forget. The picture is shamelessly manipulative, but in the best melodramatic sense. It is the tale of a high school senior who was going nowhere fast until he met the girl who would change his life forever. Landon, the coolest guy at Beaufort High, rules an in-crowd that lives to make cruel fun of those on the outside. Jamie, a preacher's daughter who wears plain clothes and spends her time reading books, is the last girl Landon would notice. Everything changes after a school prank goes terribly wrong and the pair are thrown together. There is a tragic twist, and it is here that the performances and direction raise the material. True, much of A Walk to Remember seems as if the creators of Dawson's Creek and Seventh Heaven had gotten together to remake Love Story. Instead of the classic Love means never having to say you're sorry, in Karen Janszen's script, we get Without suffering there would be no compassion. Still, like Love Story, Shankman's film carries a powerful emotional punch. West, a brooding babe-in-training, weaves a complex web of feelings in his portrayal of Landon. The sexy Moore, certainly among the most winning of the latest crop of singers, is even more captivating as an actress. Shankman directs the pair with an eye for truth, and he gets lovely performances as well from a loopier-than-usual Daryl Hannah as Landon's mom and especially from Peter Coyote as Jamie's concerned father. Julio Macat's cinematography makes terrific use of the North Carolina locations. Terrific, in fact, describes the whole affair. -- Octavio Roca Horror thriller. Starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton. Directed by Mark Pellington. (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Mothman Prophecies doesn't resort to the cheap jolts of other thrillers, which is commendable. Unfortunately, the movie's more abstract scare tactics -- flashes of a spooky winged creature, disembodied telephone voices -- are so restrained that viewers may start to yearn for a bogeyman to burst from the closet. Since the mothman made it into the title, a little bit more of the menacing insect would have been nice. The giant, red-eyed spirit beast appears during a car crash in a frightening early scene. But after that, we get only drawings of it -- or should it be him? -- and talk of its motivation. Red light signifies its presence, morphing mothman into an urban legend instead of a movie monster. Richard Gere plays a Washington Post reporter (why do they always work for the Washington Post?) whose wife dies from cancer shortly after the car crash. The mothman prophesies more bad things for Gere. Otherworldly forces lead Gere's Audi to a tiny town in West Virginia where scary occurrences abound and the prettiest, smartest woman in town is also, naturally, its sheriff. She's played by Gere's Primal Fear co-star Laura Linney. Gere makes an effective everyman, dropping the rapid blinking and heavy breathing he sometimes uses as shorthand for distress. Linney possesses such a noble bearing that the regulation police duds actually become her. Director Mark Pellington has visual panache, as he showed in Arlington Road. Using a palette of blues and grays, inventive camera angles and subtle musical cues, he establishes an eerily beautiful mood early in Mothman. But he overdoes the visual tricks. Will Patton, as a local yokel haunted by spirits, and Alan Bates, as a professor addled by the mothman, make the best of their stock characters. Each adds a hint of craziness that suggests that this stuff might be in the townspeople's heads. Some events in the film supposedly really happened in the 1960s in Point Pleasant, W.Va. Mothman sightings, lore and paraphernalia apparently are still the rage in the area, where the monster is sort of the Appalachian Sasquatch. -- Carla Meyer Japanese animation. Directed by Rintaro. (Not rated. 96 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Metropolis is a superior animated film from Japan. In its use of the medium, it's a step beyond American animation. It's conceived on a big scale and doesn't limit itself to the conventions of a children's film. In fact, Metropolis tells a rather complicated, adult story. It takes place in a future America in which humans and robots live together but robots are second-class citizens. The evil Duke Red is working to suppress the robot population, while at the same time employing a mad scientist named Laughton -- as in actor Charles Laughton, the mad scientist in The Island of Lost Souls (1932) -- to create the perfect robot, by which he can control humanity. Through circumstances not worth explaining, Tima, the perfect robot, gets loose before she is completed, and it falls to a boy, Kenichi, to protect her and teach her language. Their odyssey, as they dodge various henchmen, takes them into the city's lower depths, where the downtrodden robots live, work and plan an uprising. Metropolis is based on the comic by Japanese animation legend Osamu Tezuka, the creator of Astro Boy. The film has echoes of Fritz Lang's Metropolis, with its underground city and its images of oppression through technology. But the look and feel of this film are much different. It doesn't look like any other movie. The urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks, and the color palette, with lots of somber blues and pinks, is dreamy and evocative. The camera shots are also imaginatively conceived. Director Rintaro comes at scenes from oblique, unexpected and psychologically suggestive angles. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Scooby-Doo' Live action/special effects comedy. Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini and Rowan Atkinson. Directed by Raja Gosnell. Written by James Gunn. (PG. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The first camp will see Scooby-Doo as a fun, innocuous way to spend 87 minutes, while the other camp will say it's a sappy, formulaic vehicle that exists to spawn sequels and merchandise. In which camp is this reviewer? For now, let's just say this: If you focus solely on the film's acting, you come away somewhat satisfied that Matthew Lillard (who plays the Shaggy beatnik character), Freddie Prinze Jr. (the vain, spoiled Fred), Sarah Michelle Gellar (cast as the beautiful Daphne) and Linda Cardellini (the brainy Velma) did the best they could with their parts. The plot? That has the mystery-solving team of Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, Velma and their large, talking, animated dog, Scooby-Doo, flying to Spooky Island, where a mysterious man named Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) runs an amusement park for college-age students on spring break. Lately, the students have been undergoing odd transformations at Spooky Island, arriving as typical thrill-seekers but leaving as stiff, brain-locked automatons. Who's sabotaging the theme park? That's the question for the private investigating quintet. The premise behind Scooby-Doo lets an animated dog and his best friends roam around a tropical hideaway, enter strange buildings and -- if they can avoid getting hurt -- unveil the secret behind all the monstrous mayhem. For families with children, Scooby-Doo might be a fine way to while away some time. For adults still hooked on the Scooby-Doo series (I hope that's not a sizable group), this film will also be fun. Others contemplating Scooby- Doo will have to ask themselves this: Do you really want to spend money watching what is essentially marginality, or would those dollars be better used to see a better film or even buy a good book? -- Jonathan Curiel Drama. Directed and written by Dover Kosashvili. (Not rated. 100 minutes. In Georgian and Hebrew with English subtitles. At the UA Galaxy, Rafael Film Center in San Rafael and Towne 3 in San Jose.) Zaza, played by the charismatic, sleepy-eyed Lio Ashkenazi, is a 31-year- old graduate student in philosophy who keeps dodging his parents' matchmaking efforts. By his estimation, they've made 100 attempts to find him a wife: The ones I liked didn't like me, he shrugs. Zaza isn't gay; he's not even overly picky. The real source of resistance is his secret relationship with Judith (Ronit Elkabetz), a beautiful Moroccan divorcee with a 6-year-old daughter. When Zaza's family discovers the romance, they converge on Judith's apartment, humiliate her and threaten her life in front of her daughter. The brutal frankness of that scene is matched by a long, earlier episode when Zaza and Judith have sex. The actors are naked and nothing is held back, but Kosashvili doesn't sweeten the moment with dramatic lighting or cunning camera moves. It feels real, unvarnished, but is no less sexy for those qualities. Kosashvili focuses on character dynamics, lets scenes run on for a long time and rarely moves the camera. Late Marriage at first feels flat and enervated; after a while the pacing, lack of artifice and compelling story create a kind of hypnotizing pull. Ashkenazi and Elkabetz are sensational in the lead roles, struggling to protect their love against the combined force of Zaza's family. Zaza's mother, cold and invincible, is played by Lili Kosashvili, the director's mother. -- Edward Guthmann Drama. Starring Jacqueline Bisset, Martha Plimpton and Nick Stahl. Directed by Christopher Munch. (Not rated. 94 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Directed by Christopher Munch, the film is semiautobiographical, based on the story of the director's mother. It's at times moving and at other times slow, but what makes the film compelling is the mood it instills in the audience, a mood very much like the melancholy and disorienting cloud that comes over us when a loved one is seriously ill. Jacqueline Bisset plays the mother, Frances, a woman with a colorful past as a jazz disc jockey in her youth and as a social activist, freelance writer and history buff in her later years. Along the way, there were the men, who fell in love with her, had their heads handed to them and spent the rest of their lives growing old and daydreaming. Bisset, of course, makes it easy to believe in Frances' allure, but she also brings a quality of wisdom and sadness, an unsentimental acceptance of the fact that a single life, even one lived to the fullest, just isn't enough. The camera is right on Bisset for much of the movie, much of it filmed in close-up, revealing a performance of truth and depth. For Martha Plimpton, as the daughter -- a corporate lawyer suddenly seized by a need to know her birth parents -- the movie provides a chance to break out of the satiric comic roles for which she has been noted and to dive into something emotional. She succeeds. The Sleepy Time Gal is sneaky in the best way. Its rhythms and currents sink into a viewer's consciousness and linger in the mind. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Ryan Gosling. Directed and written by Henry Bean. (R. 100 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling (Murder by Numbers), the movie is powerful and provocative. It's also built on a faulty premise, one it follows into melodrama and silliness. Maybe those aspects put studios e off -- that is, until Showtime aired the movie and a small distributor agreed to release it. Writer and director Henry Bean's concept -- that a brilliant yeshiva student is so tortured by religious questions that he turns on his own people - - is initially intriguing, if counterintuitive. Watching Gosling's conflicted, rage-filled face as he terrorizes a helpless Jewish kid, you almost buy it. Almost. Bean never establishes what made such a bright kid into a monster. Having to associate with thickheaded racist cronies would drive a smart guy up the wall. But the character is supposed to be rejecting an oppressive God and what he sees as Jews' inaction in the face of brutality. Wouldn't he turn his rage toward God or toward the Jews' oppressors, then? The movie's shift into an implausible thriller magnifies its lack of character development. But Gosling gives an impassioned performance throughout. The skinny former Mousketeer carries himself with such self-assured menace that he becomes imposing. You believe it when his character beats the stuffing out of a muscle-bound rival skinhead. The most maddening aspect of the film is how a single scene can be dumb and profound at the same time. When the racist skinheads are sent to sensitivity training at a Holocaust survivors' group, the setup strains credibility but then delivers the picture's most emotionally satisfying moment. After Gosling's arrogant know-it-all condemns a man for failing to pummel the Nazis who killed his son, a woman responds, Here in this rich, safe, stupid country, it's easy to imagine one's self a hero. Exactly, just as it's easy to make a controversial movie without saying enough. -- Carla Meyer Drama. Starring Emmanuelle Beart, Charles Berling and Isabelle Huppert. Directed by Oliver Assayas. (Not rated. 180 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected. An adaptation of a French novel, Les Destinees Sentimentale, it spans the first 30 years of the 20th century as it follows Jean, a spiritually restless fellow who gets dragged into the family porcelain business. Jean, who's played by Charles Berling, starts off passive and gloomy, and he ends up that way. Three hours of this guy. Jean's story is hardly interesting or emblematic enough to be worthy of a feature-length movie, much less the epic treatment. Fortunately, his women have more life to them. Isabelle Huppert is Jean's estranged first wife, a woman of remote demeanor and suppressed rage. And Emmanuelle Beart is wife No. 2, with whom Jean makes an idyllic life in Switzerland, only to risk blowing it with his indifference. Huppert and Beart are two of the best actresses in Europe, but they can't save this movie. Pockets of life are rare but worth savoring. Director Olivier Assayas may have trouble shaping scenes, but he does take us through the porcelain-making process, showing us the workings of a turn-of-the-century factory, from the pottery making to the hand-painting to the glazing. Best of all is the ballroom scene, which comes early. In every other ballroom scene in movies, the sound is amplified, glorious and overpowering. Here the music is quiet enough that we can hear the rustle of clothing and the feet on the ballroom floor. The scene is not nearly as romantic as what we've come to expect, but it's more human. Still, if given a choice of whether to sit through Les Destinees, take the sweatbox. Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. -- Mck LaSalle ",1
"'See Spot Run' Comedy. Starring David Arquette, Anthony Anderson, Paul Sorvino. Directed by John Whitesell. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Arquette, by comparison, fares slightly better. But watching him slip around in dog poo and shriek all-too-true lines like I'm covered in caca really, um, smarts. The lunatic star of the Scream series and Ready to Rumble has graduated to the even less plum role of a slacker mail carrier stuck baby-sitting for a neighbor's skeptical son (Angus T. Jones) and caring for an FBI mutt wanted by the mob. Having ignored that unofficial Hollywood mantra about not working with animals, children and Arquettes, Paul Sorvino plays the mafioso, who's lost $22 million and a testicle to Spot, a.k.a. Agent 11. The film tries giving Arquette room to do his thing -- acting like that almost-30 dude still living in his parents' basement. See David Arquette get an electric shock, see him race from lawn to lawn with a slingshot and Super Soaker, see rotund but magically nimble co-star Anthony Anderson jack scenes from Arquette. It's all a setup for more burning questions, for instance, is there a Jim Carrey living somewhere in Arquette? Is there even an Andy Dick? -- Wesley Morris Comedy. Starring Bradford Tatum and Meredith Scott Lynn. Featuring Kelsey Grammer and Jason Priestley. Directed by Tatum and Scott Lynn. (Not rated. 93 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Kelsey Grammer shows up for two scenes in this deadpan comedy about relationships, Los Angeles style. The Frasier star plays, with fey amusement, a movie director who has commissioned a prosthetic vagina for one of his actresses. Writer-director Bradford Tatum plays the vagina sculptor and all that implies -- his demanding girlfriend is Meredith Scott Lynn, who tells him where to put it, and, finally, where to shove it. Movie director Verk (Grammer) is also demanding, in his twinkly way. He wants the sculptor -- actually a Hollywood special-effects technician -- to redo the rubber vagina and make it more O'Keeffey, which he does. Verk always wears a skullcap and in his second scene appears to be wearing a skirt over hiking boots, but nothing whatsoever is made of it. Grammer's presence may be explained by the fact that he is directing Scott Lynn in a sitcom pilot for NBC. All in all, this little indie novelty leaves the impression of being made by a group of talented friends. Jason Priestley is surprisingly sweet as a confidant who tells the sculptor all the latest details of his love life and thinks the universe is sending him messages. This is a magnificent time to be alive, he keeps reminding people. -- Bob Graham Drama. Starring Henry Thomas, David Strathairn and Cara Seymour. Directed by Katherine Dieckmann. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Rafael.) This debut from writer-director Katherine Dieckmann is a sly little picture that starts out as a slice of lazy rural life and ends up a creepy thriller. Henry Thomas plays Toker, a misfit who finds a baby in the woods -- a very photogenic baby, incidentally. He goes door to door asking local women if they've misplaced an infant, but he gets answers like, I don't want it. I don't have a solitary need for it. So he's a daddy. Meanwhile, a salesman from up north named Truman drives into town selling cleaning products. It's quite a sight: David Strathairn as Truman, standing in a rural gas station, trying to fast-talk the owner into carrying Amerishine products -- while in the background, empty plains. It's an American tableau, the entrepreneurial will in collision with the impersonal vastness of the land. But Truman is more than Willie Loman on wheels. Strathairn and the director do something rather remarkable with him. From the beginning, he's eerie and disturbing, even when he does nothing objectionable. It could be the extra intensity of his concentration, or the way he invades the other characters' space. In any case, A Good Baby re-creates that chilling sense that comes when, in the middle of a pleasant conversation, one realizes the other person is off his rocker. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'State and Main'  Comedy. Starring William H. Macy, Sarah Jessica Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon and Alec Baldwin. Written and directed by David Mamet. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Sooner or later every important playwright or novelist who goes Hollywood ends up writing about it. The result is that movies about the movie industry are practically a genre unto themselves, dating from before Show People (1928) and moving on up through Wag the Dog, which Mamet co-wrote. In State and Main Mamet finds an angle just new enough to be fresh. It's about a Hollywood crew that comes to make a movie in a small town in Vermont. It's easy to imagine the genesis for the film, once one knows that Mamet works in the picture business but lives in Vermont. State and Main is, among other things, about the culture clash between Mamet's two worlds. William H. Macy, whose name in the credits is always good news, plays Whit Price, whose film is already over budget, thanks to having had to stop production in another New England town -- the leading man seduced an underage girl. Macy plays the director as a study in single-mindedness. At a moment's notice he will go from utter contempt (for the crew) to open-hearted friendliness (toward local officials) to big-eyed sincerity (as he tries to persuade the leading lady to do a topless scene). He knows only one thing: He is making that movie, no matter what. Mamet also gives him some of the best lines. When a assistant brings him lunch, he snaps, Like I'm really going to eat carbohydrates! Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the writer, a playwright whose lucky break is turning into a nightmare of demented rewrites. He is told he needs to change the location of the old mill scenes, even though his screenplay is titled The Old Mill. For all the laughs, State and Main becomes the story of the writer's struggle to maintain his soul -- with a little help from the chirpy, intuitive young woman who runs the local bookstore (played by Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon). The sweet romance is the one conventional touch, but it's warm and pleasing. Alec Baldwin is terrific as the reptilian pond scum of a leading man who can't keep his hands off young girls. It's just his luck that the teenager (Julia Stiles) who brings him room service is even more depraved than he is. Sarah Jessica Parker also shines as the leading lady who gets a sudden attack of modesty, even though, as one of the crew members says, most Americans can draw her breasts from memory. -- Mick LaSalle Advisory: This film contains adult language and sexual situations.  Documentary. Directed by Kevin MacDonald. Narrated by Michael Douglas. (Not rated. 92 minutes. At the Lumiere.) In 1972, when Munich hosted the Summer Olympics, the German government saw the event as a chance to erase memories of the '36 Olympics, when the Nazis appropriated the event as a propaganda tool. Hoping to encourage fraternity and a sense of openness, they kept security light and called the gathering the Olympics of Peace and Joy. Instead, it became a nightmare of terrorism and police ineptitude. While swimmer Mark Spitz and gymnast Olga Korbut were racking up gold medals, eight Palestinian terrorists broke into the Olympic Village and took 11 Israeli athletes and coaches hostage. Their demand: the release of 236 political prisoners from jails in Israel and other countries. That's the story told by Kevin MacDonald in his Oscar-winning documentary, One Day in September. Tense, upsetting and exhaustively researched, MacDonald's film offers a moment-by-moment recounting of events that unfolded over 21 hours in Munich. Drawing from news footage and interviews with several witnesses and participants -- including the one surviving member of the Black September guerrillas -- One Day in September shows how a lack of security made the tragedy possible, and how a series of horrendous mistakes (and ultimately, collusion) by German police allowed it to escalate. Amazingly, the Olympic Committee refused to halt the Games after the first hostages were murdered. According to Zvi Samir, former chief of the Israeli secret service, The rescue was secondary to the desire to keep the Games going. Impassioned and well-crafted, One Day in September is also grueling. By emphasizing public-relations concerns over human lives, we see, Germany and Olympics officials blurred the line between passivity and cruelty. -- Edward Guthmann Advisory: This film contains violence.

"'Summer Catch' Sports drama. Starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jessica Biel. Directed by Mike Tollin. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It stars Freddie Prinze Jr., a likable actor who is beginning to become associated with a genre, or is it just a quality? Really lousy movies. He plays Ryan, a blue-collar kid with a mean left arm, who's pitching in the Cape Cod summer league. So Summer Catch is a sports movie, but with no feel for the sport. Ryan goes through most of the story stymied by a pitching problem that I could have solved after watching him two minutes. Summer Catch is also about a place -- Cape Cod -- but there's no sense of location or community. There's a romance, too, or the shape of one. Young Ryan and rich girl Tenley (Jessica Biel) meet and immediately launch into a series of discussions of their relationship, but we never see the relationship, only the discussions. Through a clumsy voice-over, Summer Catch announces itself as a character study in its first moments. But Ryan has no character problem, because Ryan . . . has no personality. In making this bomb, director Mike Tollin had the aid of Kevin Falls and John Gatins' amazing screenplay, in which everyone gets an emotional speech that makes no sense. The father makes a speech; Ryan's brother makes a speech; Ryan's drunken buddy makes a speech; his girlfriend makes a speech; and his girlfriend makes another speech. Prinze reacts to each speech by screwing up his face and breathing funny. A sensible reaction. -- Mick LaSalle Starring Hector Elizondo, Elizabeth Pena. Directed by Maria Ripoll. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At the Lumiere.) When the eldest, least sexually spontaneous sister (Pena) experiences the liberation of smashing crockery on the kitchen floor, the film and Pena treat it like an orgasmic release. The gustatory, the culinary and the corporeal are all bound up in the same spiritual erotic energy -- and the same standard family-spat-and-make-up plot. Director Maria Ripoll, as deft as she is with her cast, grows addicted to the plot's featherweight tics -- three sisters trying to start doing it for themselves. Lee's film had an almost metaphysical elegance; this one chafes against TV-drama conventions. At each meal, one woman has an announcement, and Papa Elizondo goes blank to keep from going postal. Ripoll gets a lot of mileage from her actors' vivid throwaway details, notably the way Pena gnaws at her bottom lip when she's nervous or when's she horny (which is why she's nervous) or the way Elizondo, who's rarely been better, says everything by saying nothing. It's a resplendently basic, lovey- dovey and inside-out King Lear. Even when it's pulsing with convention, the film parses out the difference between the dissolution of a family and the expansion of the way it defines itself. This includes the sensual deployment of Mexican cuisine as a unifying device. -- Wesley Morris Mystery. Starring Susie Porter and Kelly McGillis. Directed by Samantha Lang. (Not rated. 91 minutes. At the Castro.) McGillis (remembered from Top Gun) brings a combination of fire and ice to this murder mystery from Australia. Poetry, lesbian sex and murder might be a killer combination if a deadly pace weren't included in the mix. Susie Porter plays the leather-jacketed young detective Jill, and McGillis is Diana, the older, more worldly and ambiguously married poetry instructor. If the novelty, in movies anyway, of a lesbian private eye isn't enough, there's the added attraction of Dorothy Porter's novel in poetry translated to the screen, with the salty poetry in voice-overs. Diana's sometimes arch and supercilious tone in the academic setting of faded intellectuals is contrasted with Jill's Sydney street smarts. While the solution of the mystery ultimately seems to have more to do with circumstance than any detecting by Jill -- at least any that she lets us in on -- the sex-saturated atmosphere and explicit imagery of the poetry certainly will make the audience sit up and take notice. Even so, the movie can't quite seem to make up its mind whether it's going to take a satiric attitude toward some of the characters involved in the world of poetry, but there's no question they invite it. -- Bob Graham Drama. Starring Clive Owen, Helen Mirren and Natasha Little. Directed by Joel Hershman. (R. 91 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) Greenfingers, about a bitter English prisoner who discovers his soul through gardening, is no surprise in its story but a considerable surprise in its execution. Written and directed by an American, Joel Hershman, but starring a cast of English actors, the picture succeeds in capturing the movement of a soul from hopelessness to humanity. The success of the film has a lot to do with Clive Owen (Croupier), who brings a world of subtext to his silences. Hardened by serving 15 years in maximum security for murder, Colin is transferred to a country club prison, with no high walls and no searchlights. But he won't play along. He won't socialize, and he wards off kindness as though avoiding pain. He can't stand anyone being nice to him, because he can't forgive himself. By chance, Colin plants a packet of violets, and when the flowers bloom, something takes root. In the hands of another actor and another director, this moment might have been corny. Here it carries the weight it deserves. It's not a transformation, just one seed planted in the barren soil of Colin's spirit. Helen Mirren plays a flighty but hard-driving celebrity gardener who takes an interest in Colin and his prison colleagues' work. Only occasionally does the film fall into the trap of making the prisoners cute, but it never falters in important ways. Colin remains a complex and sympathetic figure. Greenfingers is a film by and for adults. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Nastassja Kinski, Tony Goldwyn and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Eva Gardos. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Nastassja Kinski and Tony Goldwyn play upper-class Hungarians in 1950 who cross the Iron Curtain and make a home in a Los Angeles suburb. Circumstances force them to leave their baby daughter, Suzanne, in Hungary, but after five years of effort, the family is reunited in America. The tale of escape and assimilation into 1950s America is riveting. Kinski's emotional presence proves that, when given the chance, this is an actress of real power. American Rhapsody was written and directed by Eva Gardos, whose childhood experiences paralleled those of Suzanne. So long as the film centers on the mother and father, Gardos shows a sure hand. But when the picture skips to 1965 and concentrates on the angst of the 15-year-old Suzanne (Scarlett Johansson, Ghost World), Gardos gets lost in her own reflection. Suzanne is a brat and a monster, yet neither Gardos nor Johansson seem to comprehend just how repellent she is. When Johansson is meant to appear sensitive, she comes across as narcissistic and vapid. It turns a movie intended to present an American triumph into an unintentional story of failure. Had she stayed in Hungary, she might have had a soul. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Directed by Sebastien Lifshitz. (Not rated. 93 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) Whereas Felix' is sunny and capricious, Come Undone, which showed at this year's San Francisco International Film Festival, is melancholic and downbeat. Director Sebastien Lifshitz, a former assistant to French director Claire Denis (Beau Travail), introduces Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim), a shy, reedy 18-year-old who's vacationing with his depressed mother and hostile sister. Sexually naive, he goes to the beach and meets Cedric (Stephane Rideau), a beautiful, confident local who becomes his first male lover. Lifshitz explores depression, identity and coming-out conflicts -- Mathieu can't show affection in public, Cedric is boldly uninhibited -- and has a deft way of jumbling time so that the pieces of Mathieu's story only gradually shift into place. The photography is strong, the performances sympathetic and the sex plentiful. Come Undone doesn't strain to please, but sticks to a standard of emotional honesty in following Mathieu's journey, and casting a shrewd eye as he stumbles toward self-awareness. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"'The Endurance' Documentary. Narrated by Liam Neeson. Directed by George Butler. (Not rated. 93 minutes. At the Castro.) The picture tells a tale of human endurance that's harrowing and at times inspirational, and it just might strike a chord: In its own way, it's the kind of entertainment audiences could use right now -- not blithe escapism nor maudlin sentimentality, but something real that feeds the spirit. Ernest Shackleton was an English explorer who in 1914 assembled a crew for a trip to the Antarctic, but a funny thing happened on the way to the Pole. One night, the temperature dropped 40 degrees (to 20 below zero), and they woke to find that the ocean had frozen around them. They couldn't budge. All they could do was wait for the Antarctic spring to see if things got better. Things got worse. The Endurance, a sure Oscar contender, tells the story through diary entries and interviews with scholars and the crew's descendants. Vivid color footage gives us a picture of what the men saw. But by far the most valuable footage in the film was shot by the men themselves. These intimate, black-and- white still photos give us a sense of the men's personalities. These fellows were the last of the seafaring adventurers, people from a complete other time. And yet, with their short hair and wire-rimmed glasses, their faces look so modern that it often comes as a jolt. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Ian Hart. Directed by Stephen Frears. Written by Jimmy McGovern. (Rated R. 90 minutes. At the Embarcadero, Albany in Albany, Camera 3 in San Jose and Century Cinema 16 in Mountain View.) There isn't much that Stephen Frears hasn't tackled in his career: film noir in The Grifters, single-man woes in High Fidelity, 18th century sexual duplicity in Dangerous Liaisons. In Liam, he delivers one of his loveliest, most heartfelt films. Written by Jimmy McGovern (Priest), this is a quiet, scaled-down beauty about a 7- year-old Catholic boy growing up in Liverpool in the late '30s. Anthony Borrows, a boy with the face of an angel and no previous acting experience, is fantastic in the title role. An archetypal innocent with a cheery disposition and bad stutter, Liam has a good life until his father (Ian Hart) loses his shipyard job. The family is suddenly dependent on Liam's sister (Megan Burns) and brother (David Hart); shamed, the father succumbs to the anti-Semitism of the time and joins a group of right-wing thugs. Frears shows us the tale through Liam's eyes, tweaking the drama to give us the sensation of how a child experiences the world. The pious threats of a schoolteacher, then, tend to verge on parody, just as the impatience of Liam's mother (Claire Hackett) seems a tad overplayed. With his gorgeous, trusting eyes, young Borrows brings the fragility and uncertainty of childhood painfully alive. Frears also demonstrates how economic troubles give rise to racism and intolerance -- a message that couldn't be better timed. The mood of Liam is downbeat, ultimately tragic, but there's a wondrous, sad beauty here. Like Terence Davies' The Long Day Closes, another coming-of-age tale set in midcentury Liverpool, Liam conjures a specific period while reminding us that love, prejudice and the need for mutual understanding are unbound by time or place. -- Edward Guthmann Mockumentary. Starring Laura Kirk, Nat DeWolf, Griffin Dunne. Directed by Dunne. Written by Kirk and DeWolf. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Once they hit it big, actors are almost expected to be obnoxiously self- involved. But imagine those people before they made it, their hubris and naked drive not yet smoothed over by the luster of celebrity. That's what the struggling actor friends Lisa and Tate are like in director Griffin Dunne's often hilarious mockumentary Lisa Picard Is Famous. Dunne plays a fumbling documentarian seeking a subject on the cusp of fame to show how it will change her. He picks Lisa Picard, who's gotten very minor buzz for an erotic cereal commercial and a part in a Melissa Gilbert TV movie. Lisa, already practicing for stardom, isn't really surprised that someone wants to film her. She and Tate are acting at all times, even pantomiming meetings with agents. Laura Kirk and Nat DeWolf, the obscure New York actors who play Lisa and Tate, wrote Lisa based on their own misadventures. Both play the fool splendidly, but also show the tenuous nature of the characters' friendship. Each would throw the other over for the right TV pilot. OK, any TV pilot. Sleazy agents and snippy assistants are played for laughs, but the film hits trickier targets as well. Tate, who is gay, writes a solo show about his experiences with homophobia and gay-bashing, though he's experienced neither. The show, with Tate clad in tighty-whities before a backdrop of hate-crime newspaper clippings and a giant pink triangle, is Larry Kramer filtered through a bad Afterschool Special. Lisa and Tate's story alternates with cameos of real-life celebrities examining the phenomenon of fame. Sandra Bullock, Carrie Fisher and Spike Lee also appear, giving Lisa enough star wattage to satisfy the fame whore in all of us. -- Carla Meyer Documentary. Directed by Gillian Grisman. (Rated PG-13. 81 minutes. Opens today at the Embarcadero and Towne in San Jose, Oct. 12 at Shattuck in Berkeley and Regency in San Rafael.) Shaggy, friendly and frayed at the seams, Grateful Dawg is a lot like its subjects, mandolinist David Grisman and guitar legend Jerry Garcia. Directed by Grisman's daughter Gillian and made up of home movies, interviews, concert footage and live recordings, this is a musical portrait from the heart. The younger Grisman traces the two men's musical partnership to 1964, when they met at a Pennsylvania folk club; looks back at the bluegrass band they formed in the early '70s; and celebrates the renewal of the friendship when, after a long rift, they played a 1990 reunion gig at Sweetwater in Mill Valley. Fellow musician Peter Rowan says Grisman and Garcia were born out of the same cosmic egg -- despite the difference between Grisman's discipline and Garcia's lack thereof. Both men had a passion for acoustic roots music and left a treasure of recordings that capture that passion. For Deadheads, forever hungry to see more of Garcia, the film reveals the Grateful Dead guitarist at his most relaxed and playful. For music fans, there's great pleasure in hearing new audio tracks to Sitting Here in Limbo, Friend of the Devil and more songs -- each one complete and unedited. -- Edward Guthmann Satire/horror. Starring Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. Directed by John Fawcett. (Not rated. 105 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Ginger Snaps is the best teenage werewolf movie ever made. Beyond the werewolf gimmick, it's an honest and thoroughly twisted portrait of adolescence that almost achieves the instant-classic status of a Freeway, the Reese Witherspoon film that made a local sensation a few years back. Ginger Snaps is not quite in that league, but it can be mentioned in the same breath. Screenwriter Karen Walton uses the werewolf myth as a metaphor for blossoming sexuality, and she does so with wit and a feminist edge. Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle, both striking talents, play Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald, a pair of weird sisters in a suburban Canadian school. Both are goths, obsessed with death, and neither has ever menstruated, though Brigitte is 15 and Ginger almost 16. On the day Ginger gets her first period, she is scratched and bitten by a werewolf, and over the next weeks finds herself sprouting fangs, growing a tail and becoming increasingly irritable. As in many horror movies, the real horror is sexuality -- but here the point of view is decidedly feminine and satirical. About the worst that can be said of Ginger Snaps is that 15 minutes before the finish, it breaks down and becomes a conventional horror film. With horror films, there are worse things that can happen. -- Mick LaSalle Animation. Directed and written by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. (R. 105 minutes. At the Opera Plaza and Shattuck in Berkeley.) Based on Demon Deathchase, the third in a popular series of illustrated novels, Vampire Hunter D takes place in a distant, post- apocalyptic future. The animation is rich and densely detailed, the characters well defined. The film also offers a brooding protagonist with tragic-romantic appeal. Dressed in black with a broad-rimmed, three-sided hat that covers one eye, D rides his horse through a lawless terrain and is half-vampire himself. Torn between his sympathetic human side and his deadly vampire impulse, D is clearly based on Clint Eastwood's iconic Man With No Name. Minus the serape. Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri has a gift for striking visuals, but his story manages to be simultaneously thin and chaotic. The American voices are also flat: If Japanese animators want true crossover success in the West, they'll need better actors to bring their characters to life. -- Edward Guthmann Children's comedy. Starring Alex D. Linz, Zena Grey and Josh Peck. Directed by Tim Hill. (Rated PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Alex D. Linz plays young Max, a little junior high school fellow who finds himself harassed by bullies and on the outs with the in crowd. One night, his parents tell him that they are moving 1,000 miles away to Chicago in a matter of days. Max realizes his opportunity. He can do a hit-and-run on all the people he ever disliked, then escape before they retaliate. A movie like this depends on clever bits and incidents, but there's little invention here to disguise the film's formulaic nature. Max takes revenge on an evil ice cream man by figuring out a way of dumping gallons upon gallons of ice cream on him. That's almost good for a laugh. Maybe not. Linz is confident without being obnoxious, and the adult cast is more than adequate. Robert Carradine and Nora Dunn play Max's parents, and Clifton Davis has a welcome cameo as a school superintendent. Best of all, there's Larry Miller as the preening, corrupt school principal. Unfortunately, Miller can be only as funny as the lines and the physical shtick allow him to be. It's not much. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'The Others'  Thriller. Starring Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan. Written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Others flirts with sincere metaphysical psych-outs as it tries to communicate Grace's (Kidman) situation. She's an ultra-Christian World War II widow fidgeting in her haunted mansion off the northern coast of England. Not long ago, her housekeeping staff vanished, which meant preparing meals and looking after her light-phobic son and daughter (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) by herself. One day, a creepy three-person replacement housekeeping crew -- the moxie and brains of which belong to Fionnula Flanagan -- arrives at the front door, ready to help keep the kids in the dark. Amenabar, who wrote and directed The Others, is Spain's burgeoning it auteur. His film is predicated on a panicky Kidman running from one room to the next, growing in fury and exasperation as the narrative tightens nooselike around her. Amenabar keeps her -- and us -- in the dark until the final scene, which reveals a convoluted supernatural hoax that has the misfortune of smacking other movies starring metaphysics. To Amenabar's credit, The Others is as hardworking as, if less frenzied than, his other features, notably the chronology-on-a-yo-yo thriller Open Your Eyes. Here he has fashioned a tonal and stylistic tribute to the eerie kid-fright of The Spirit of the Beehive and The Sixth Sense and to Hitchcock. Kidman's paranoia is on loan from Gaslight, while Grace's hair and makeup are that of the late, same-named princess who was in similar jeopardy under Hitchcock's supervision. The Others is great as a collection of acknowledgments, but a ghost story made of a bunch of ghoulish thank-yous isn't that haunting. -- Wesley Morris One is pregnant and afraid to consider abortion; one has a party-girl mother who's more like a sister; another has to mediate between her Latino mom and African American dad. In the wonderful Our Song, director Jim McKay takes us inside the lives of these 15-year-old girls and gives an intimate look at a world that's usually trivialized in movies. McKay chucks the overheated cliches of inner- city teen dramas -- no hip-hop, no drugs, no violence -- and offers a thoughtful character study that takes these people on their own terms, without hyperbole. It's roughly the same setup he created in Girls Town, a 1996 high school drama, only this time McKay goes even deeper into his characters' lives. He directs with a light, nonimposing touch, and creates such easy rapport among the three leads, Kerry Washington, Melissa Martinez and Anna Simpson, that most of their scenes feel improvised. When the story opens, the local school is shutting down for asbestos removal and the girls are about to go off to different campuses. What binds them together is their membership in the Jackie Robinson Steppers, a true-life Brooklyn marching band that director Jim McKay integrates in his film. Through the Steppers, the girls have a focus, a stabilizing influence they'd otherwise lack. That's the backdrop, but the movie's soul isn't its plot but the relationships among the girls. McKay isn't in any hurry to tell this story: He draws the most honest moments from simple things -- Lanisha and Maria walking lazily down the street eating ice cream cones, the trio lounging on beds and spinning dreams. Just hanging out, real and unguarded. -- Edward Guthmann COMEDY. Directed and written by Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau. (Not rated. 95 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Castro and Camera in San Jose.) It's a distinctly French feeling -- an air of caprice and light expectations -- and a perfect prologue to a delightful film. Felix, beautifully played by Sami Bouajila, is a gay dockworker who turns vagabond when he's laid off. He has a father he's never met, and so, with his boyfriend's (Pierre-Loup Rajot) blessing, he hits the open road in a pea coat and knapsack and hitchhikes to the south of France. He's in no hurry, so he takes the back roads and connects with people in intimate, surprising ways. Jules (Charly Sergue) is a 17-year-old student who rapidly develops a crush on Felix. Mathilde (Patachou) is a sensual older woman who brings Felix home to move some furniture and invites him to stay, knowing that when she was younger she would have gladly bedded him. It's typical that people confide in passers-by in ways they wouldn't with close friends: There's a lot less to lose. But with someone like Felix -- sexy, emotionally open, a man-child with no attitude -- that dynamic is accelerated. There's an erotic encounter with a hunky railroad worker (Philippe Garziano), a madcap adventure with a single mom of three (Ariane Ascaride) and a lazy afternoon with a fisherman (Maurice Benichou) so mellow and comfortable that we start wishing he were the true father. Each of these encounters is introduced with a title -- Little Brother, Cousin, Grandmother -- suggesting that Felix is creating his own family in his father's absence. Adventures doesn't underline Felix's sexuality -- it just takes it for granted. His HIV status is treated casually, with a trip to a clinic and a daily regimen of meds, and when he kisses his boyfriend in public there's no sense of embarrassment or risk. In that sense, Adventures of Felix is a tad dreamlike: Like the recent Big Eden, it imagines a world in which gay men aren't marginalized, and everyone's better, sweeter nature is set free. -- Edward Guthmann  Thriller. Starring Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel. Directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. (R. 105 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Reno is the main reason to see Crimson Rivers, a French film whose title does not refer to the great outdoors but to the great indoors -- namely the human circulatory system. It's a system that, in this gory and disturbing film, has a way of getting rerouted -- onto the carpet, the sidewalk, everywhere -- which brings in Reno. He plays Niemans, a tough Parisian cop with a deadpan expression and big bags under a set of alert eyes. In one scene he is looking at the mutilated corpse of a victim who'd been tortured before death. He asks the coroner how long the torture had gone on, and the answer comes: Five hours. This is where the Mitchum connection comes in: Director Mathieu Kassovitz just holds on Reno's face as he takes in the information. Reno does nothing, but he does everything. He conveys the sense of a man absorbing yet another atrocity into an already pessimistic world view. This is a tough guy who can still experience horror. Some actors are just automatically the moral locus of every scene they're in. They're the major movie stars, and Reno is one of those. The picture follows two investigations, Reno's and that of Vincent Cassel, who plays a wise guy whose case ultimately crisscrosses Niemans'. Later it becomes a sort of buddy picture, about a young motor mouth and a middle-aged stoic. Crimson Rivers does not end well. But there's a lot of pleasure in getting there. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'The Squid and the Whale' Comedy-drama. Directed by Noah Baumbach. Starring Jeff Daniels, Laura Linney and Jesse Eisenberg. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . To note this is not to complain about the absence of some dramatic plot turn. In this story of an intellectual New York family torn apart by divorce, no one expects a man to walk in with a gun -- such a man would be unwelcome. But it is to be expected that a filmmaker should have digested his material, so that he knows what it means and has some point in telling his story. Writer-director Noah Baumbach hasn't done that. He just depicts incidents, which have a distinctly autobiographical feel, and then, when it's time to end his movie, he makes the barest feint in the direction of realization and meaning. But the ending is limp, fake-symbolic and disingenuous. Yet on balance, The Squid and the Whale is still a worthy film, satisfying along the way and indicative of an appealing talent. Baumbach, just now getting above the radar, also wrote and directed a post-college comedy called Kicking and Screaming (1995), an unusually witty first effort. It's still his best picture (and worth seeking out), but The Squid and the Whale has something the earlier movie doesn't have: Jeff Daniels in the most striking performance of his career. He plays a novelist whose youthful success has given way to middle-aged struggle, and yet he maintains a supercilious confidence, as though looking at the world from a lofty height. He sees himself as an expert in all things. But he's ruled by his resentment, envy and disappointments, so that he unconsciously seeks to undermine the happiness of those around him and drives his wife (Laura Linney) into the arms of other men. Daniels' is an unflinching portrait of middle-aged disappointment and willful self-delusion. The self-delusion not only prevents him from being a good husband and father, but it's probably smothering whatever spark he once had as an artist. The younger brother instinctively sides with his mother, while the elder brother, Walt (Jesse Eisenberg), despises his mother and idolizes his dad, something that Baumbach wants us to see as a grievous misapprehension. Even without knowing that this film is loosely autobiographical, would be obvious. The subjectivity results in something being a little off -- there's a piece missing. Dad is getting the historical shaft here, while Mom, whose affairs are breaking up the family, gets a pass. The unfortunate title refers to the false symbolism by which Baumbach tries to bring his story to a conclusion. The truth is, Baumbach seems not to know what he should feel. He has no distance -- for some that might be part of the appeal. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle 'Loggerheads' Drama. Written and directed by Tim Kirkman. With Kip Pardue, Tess Harper, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Kelly, Chris Sarandon, Michael Learned. (Not rated. 95 minutes. At the Embarcadero and the Shattuck Cinemas.) Message movies are a dicey proposition, and those that deliver old news are doubly handicapped. Loggerheads is a quiet, painfully sincere drama set in North Carolina telling three linked stories on the themes of adoption, intolerance and being true to oneself. It offers some impressive acting, and its heart is in the right place. But the point seems tired -- that in this particular red state, around the year 2000, sensitive types and outsiders have it pretty hard. The stories are set during three subsequent Mother's Day weekends in different parts of the state. The central tale involves Mark (Kip Pardue), a young HIV-positive wanderer who becomes involved with a lonely motel owner (Michael Kelly) in Kure Beach, a habitat of endangered loggerhead turtles. Working a heavy-handed metaphor, the film informs us that loggerheads, through some mysterious instinct, return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs. In Asheville, a troubled woman (Bonnie Hunt) who lives with her mother (Michael Learned) wants to contact the boy she gave up for adoption when she was an unwed teenager. Her efforts are hampered by North Carolina's strict privacy laws. Finally, in the town of Eden, the wife (Tess Harper) of a minister (Chris Sarandon) regrets that she allowed her husband's beliefs to drive away their gay adopted son. The film is impressively acted by Hunt and Harper as women acknowledging and trying to cope with past mistakes. It's also nice to see talents like Learned and Sarandon, though their roles are smaller. But Pardue's Mark seems washed out -- the actor doesn't register strongly enough to pull off a pivotal character. Writer-director Tim Kirkman goes in for long periods of silence, and he is certainly sympathetic to his wounded characters for their various losses. But in the end, for all its good intentions, Loggerheads is so slow and earnest that it's hard for the viewer not to lose patience. -- Advisory: This film deals with issues of sexual identity. -- Walter Addiego 'Garçon Stupide' Drama. In French with English subtitles. Directed by Lionel Baier. Starring Pierre Chatagny, Natacha Koutchoumov, Rui Pedro Alves and Lionel Baier. (Not rated. 94 mins. At the Lumiere and Act 1 and 2.) Perhaps the best thing about Lionel Baier's static coming-of-age film, Garçon Stupide, is the accuracy of the title: Loïc (Pierre Chatagny) is not only stupid, he's dull and uninteresting, as well as uninterested in the world around him. By day, Loïc works in a Swiss chocolate factory, inspecting freshly molded, rectangularly segmented chocolate bars. They are all the same. At night, he has sex with men whom he meets on the Internet. It doesn't matter if they are old, middle-aged or his own age. It doesn't matter if they are good looking or troll-like. The sex is uninteresting, to Loïc and to us. It is often depicted in split-screen, evoking the segments of the chocolate bars. One of the men who picks him up is Lionel Baier, the director, but he isn't interested in sex. He wants to know what makes Loïc tick, so he asks him questions about his life. Unfortunately, we don't share his interest. Loïc's only friend is a straight woman named Marie (Natacha Koutchoumov). They live together platonically, but Loïc comes to feel something toward her. When she finds a boyfriend, Loïc is jealous and cruel. Two things happen in Loïc's life that hold a collective glimmer of promise. He becomes obsessed with a player on the hometown team. His name is Rui. Loïc stalks him and photographs him with his cell-phone camera. Loïc thinks he can become a photographer. He thinks the best way to do that is to leave Switzerland for some exotic place like Africa, but someone advises him to photograph what he knows and tell the story of his life. He takes pictures of a trick's double piercings. As Loïc, Chatagny is skilled at being dull and disaffected. Koutchoumov makes Marie almost believable, right up to the point where we wonder why she's befriending Loïc in the first place. The sex scenes are stark and clinical. There is a certain compelling energy mumbling through the stasis that is Garçon Stupide, and there is a climax of sorts, toward which the film resolutely refuses to build. That makes the finale feel fairly phony. We keep hoping for a reason to care about Loïc and this story, and the fact that Baier provokes at least that much in us keeps the film from being a total waste of time. -- Advisory: This film contains scenes of full frontal nudity and sexual situations. -- David Wiegand 'Wait Till You're Older'  Comedy-drama. Directed by Teddy Chan. Starring Andy Lau, Karen Mok. In Cantonese with English subtitles. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the 4 Star.) Pop idol and Hong Kong movie icon Andy Lau goes into Tom Hanks and Jennifer Garner territory, portraying a moppet in a man's body in Wait Till You're Older, which has topped the Hong Kong box office the last two weekends. Despite an overly mushy script, it's mostly a fun ride, but unlike Big or 13 Going on 30, Wait Till You're Older goes where no Hollywood movies are allowed to go, lest they risk scaring away any potential box-office receipts. Kwong is an 8-year-old who hates his parents -- father Man (Felix Wong) and stepmother Min (Karen Mok). He thinks they conspired to kill his real mother (they didn't). He wants out of the family, so he steals a mad scientist's aging potion and presto -- he's Lau. He clearly enjoys life as an adult -- bullying the class bullies and dating the teacher on whom he always had a crush -- but also begins to realize he may be the glue that holds his family together. Trouble is, he continues to age, and apparently there's no antidote. Told you this wasn't Hollywood. -- Advisory: This film contains underage drinking and violence. -- G. Allen Johnson 'The Californians' Comedy. Directed by Jonathan Parker. Starring Noah Wyle, Kate Mara and Illeana Douglas. (Not rated. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Gavin Ransom (Noah Wyle) is an oily developer with a heart of gold and a strikingly handsome face. His plan: to blanket Northern California's pristine landscape with gated McMansion communities. But wait! His wicked plot goes awry after he is serenaded by Zoe Tripp (Kate Mara), an activist folksinger who's cute as a button and the vision of skintight hippie chic. The smitten capitalist soon finds he has competition for Zoe's affections in the form of his sister Olive (Illeana Douglas), a frustrated environmentalist and repressed lesbian who courts the trilling chanteuse with promises of sisterhood amid the wetlands. The Californians is almost bad enough to be good. Almost. But director Jonathan Parker's attempt to update Henry James' The Bostonians as a socially relevant romantic comedy is so leaden and obvious it's too somnambulant to be funny. The stereotypes on both sides of the environmentalist-developer conflict are as broad as urban sprawl, and have been done before and better. Talented actors such as Keith Carradine and Valerie Perrine (as Zoe's groovy parents) and Cloris Leachman (as a yawningly wise activist matriarch) are shunted to the sidelines to give center stage to the infinitely duller Wyle. Douglas, with all her expressive kookiness, is squandered. Cantering through the center of this dreck is Mara, ostensibly the star around which the other characters orbit. The finest actress would be challenged to make something from Parker and Catherine DiNapoli's glib script, and Mara is far from fine. Her Zoe is supposed to have a great voice (she doesn't); she's meant to be charismatic (she's not); she's touted as charming (she isn't). All she is, really, is a bimbo whose vacuity and wardrobe make Britney Spears look like a Harvard graduate. Let's just say she's the type of girl who goes hiking in stiletto heels and leave it at that. It's tough to present a movie as a satire when its lead character is herself so ripe for mockery. The Californians has a few good moments -- a dead-on look at shopping in a chic health-food store and Carradine's performance of the song Little Boxes come to mind -- but these isolated high points can't slow the film's dreadful descent into McMovie tedium. Bring on the bulldozers. -- Advisory: Some strong language and mild sexual situations. -- Neva Chonin ",1
"'The TV Set' Comedy-drama. Starring David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Lindsay Sloane, Ioan Gruffudd and Judy Greer. Directed by Jake Kasdan. (Rated R. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie's ring of truth gives it a special resonance. As one of the creators of Freaks and Geeks, which lasted only 12 episodes despite rave reviews, filmmaker Jake Kasdan knows firsthand of what he writes. A child of Hollywood, he had a cameo at age 8 in The Big Chill, directed by his father, Lawrence Kasdan. The TV Set leaves you feeling that the younger Kasdan knows everything to be known about how the family business eats away at creativity and forces untenable compromises to achieve homogeneity. All the characters seem like people he might have encountered, from a smooth-talking network president, Lenny (Sigourney Weaver), to a poor schlemiel writer, Mike (David Duchovny) -- who's poured his heart into a pilot based on the trauma of dealing with his brother's suicide that he naively hopes the network will pick up -- to Mike's irritatingly perky manager, Alice (Judy Greer), forever looking on the bright side of Lenny's efforts to torpedo the show. Jake Kasdan's savvy script is filled with moments that speak reams about clashing sensibilities. Lenny objects to Mike's title, The Wexler Chronicles, and after testing it out on random people (Would you watch a show called 'The Wexler Chronicles' ?), it is changed to Call Me Crazy! She also decrees that the brother can't die because, according to their research, 82 percent of people find suicide depressing. Trying to make Alice understand his artistic motivation so she can defend him, Mike tells her he hopes to evoke Taxi Driver. Greer's vacant look says more than words. Mike is incredulous that Alice could have gotten this far in the industry without seeing Scorsese's masterwork. Alice promises to put 'The Taxi Driver' on my queue. Adding the is inspired: It allows the audience, which knows the correct title, to feel superior. As a director, Kasdan still is getting his sea legs. The TV Set takes too long to get started, and scenes meander. But, as a writer, he has an unerring ear for Hollywood doublespeak, such as Lenny prefacing her complaints to Mike with, We love it, love it, but ... Weaver hasn't had a role this juicy since she threw her weight around in Working Girl, and she tears into it. Her Lenny wants to be perceived as sympathetic. She can afford to since she has all the power, especially after the success of her reality show Slut Wars. (Why didn't an actual TV exec come up with that?) Playing against type, Duchovny is convincing as a sad sack, and kudos to the costume department for putting him in unfashionable short-sleeved shirts, accentuating his outsider status. Lenny, who has a bad back, becomes more hunched over with each battle she loses, as if absorbing blows to the stomach. Ioan Gruffudd (Amazing Grace) has an amusing turn as a former BBC producer brought in to bring some British panache to the network's fall schedule. Of course Lenny and her lackeys don't want anything too smart on the air. They're just covering all the bases. While often biting, The TV Set also conveys affection for the players charged with cobbling together a new season. Call them crazy! -- Advisory: Crude language. -- Ruthe Stein It is long past time to recognize Claude Chabrol and Isabelle Huppert as one of the cinema's great actress-director collaborations, and one should no more miss one of their films than miss one by Marlene Dietrich and Von Sternberg, Norma Shearer and Monta Bell, or Anna Karina and Jean-Luc Godard. Invariably, such ongoing actress-director collaborations explore two subjects simultaneously: the story and the actress herself. So, when Von Sternberg makes Dishonored, he's not just making a spy movie, but posing the question, What if Dietrich were a spy? Likewise, in Comedy of Power, Chabrol invites us to contemplate Huppert from a new angle, as a relentless government magistrate. That Chabrol and Huppert are not lovers (and to my knowledge never have been) makes their collaboration a bit different from the ones cited above. For one thing, they've never had to break up, and, as a result, they have worked together on and off for 29 years. Chabrol doesn't use his films as an occasion to explore Huppert's mystery (or as a cover to stare at her through a camera). Rather, he seems to know her completely, so their films are not the tantalizing, longing-filled artifacts of a romance but the products of a coolheaded and considered partnership -- two artists, fully aware of each other's gifts, working to produce a mutually desired effect. In Comedy of Power, Chabrol -- who also co-authored the screenplay -- takes as his inspiration a chapter from recent French history, in which examining magistrate Eva Joly exposed the rampant fraud and bribery being perpetrated by oil executives at Elf Aquitane. Chabrol changes the names and circumstances and chooses to make his film a fiction, concentrating on the personal and professional life of the magistrate. He explores her personality, the pressures and pleasures of her ever-increasing fame and the effects of all this on her marriage. Chabrol's emphasis takes a certain amount of adjusting on the part of the viewer. Going in, Comedy of Power seems as if it's going to reveal Jeanne Charmant-Killman (Huppert) while revealing the mysteries of the case. But Chabrol is not all that interested in the case, at least not enough to make it interesting. He's interested, rather, in the cool impassiveness with which the magistrate hears the entreaties of her corporate targets. He's interested in her courage in the face of threats, in the way she talks to her husband and in the things she does to unwind after work. Ultimately, we're interested, too, for the same reason Chabrol is interested: Huppert. Comedy of Power is in many ways a meandering film, a collection of good scenes, but a film lacking anything resembling an engrossing story. But Huppert does something here that she was not able to do in her two most recent films. She gives us the impression of a complete person, a woman of unusual talent, courage and pride, with sly humor, a playful streak and an unexpected touch of coldness. If someone else were in it, there wouldn't be much of a point to Comedy of Power. But then, I doubt Chabrol would have made the movie without Huppert. As it stands, I recommend it the way I'd recommend you to go into the next room and say hello if Jeanne Charmant-Killman happened to be waiting there. She's quite a character. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language. -- Mick LaSalle 'Offside' Drama. Co-written and directed by Jafar Panahi. In Persian with subtitles. (Not rated. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Although its message is deadly serious, Offside, which placed second at the Berlin International Film Festival, is almost lighthearted, filled with wit and winning characters. It could be called a sports movie (it just made the top 10 in an all-time sports film list by RottenTomatoes.com), but no sports are played; the action takes place offscreen. Set during a World Cup qualifying soccer match between Iran and Bahrain at a stadium in Tehran, it is about a group of young women who have been detained by police for attempting to sneak into the match dressed as boys (women are not allowed to attend sporting events). The women try to reason with the young police officers, who aren't exactly thrilled with their duties (they want to watch the game as well), but the conversation evolves into a debate about women's roles in Iranian society. When Japan comes to Tehran to play Iran, how come the Japanese women are allowed into the stadium? asks one plucky young gal, with her face painted in the colors of the Iranian flag. Because they're Japanese, a policeman replies, as if it were obvious. So the problem is I am Iranian? she asks. Jafar Panahi is one of the Iranian New Wave directors who burst onto the international film scene in the 1990s. The White Balloon, from 1995, was one of several magical Persian movies that gained an international following, a list that includes Abbas Kiarostami's A Taste of Cherry, Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven, Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Gabbeh and Samira Makhmalbaf's The Apple. Now Panahi is solidifying his reputation as one of the great chroniclers of women's issues in Iran -- his 2000 film The Circle is available on DVD and is a masterpiece. As with many of his fellow directors in Tehran, censorship is a major issue. The script for Offside was rejected by the government, but, under the guise of filming a totally different project, he made it anyway. It has not been released in Iran. In soccer, offside means to have illegally crossed the last line of defenders without having the ball. The women in Panahi's film have similarly transgressed, threatening Iranian social order, and the director has sharply put their story into the back of the net. -- G. Allen Johnson ",1
"'Time Out'  Drama. Starring Aurelien Recoing and Karin Viard. Directed By Laurent Cantet. (PG-13. 132 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Human Resources was a good, straightforward tale, but Time Out is better. It's haunting. It's like a poem. Vincent (Aurelien Recoing) becomes a con artist, fleecing friends and acquaintances in order to maintain the fantasy and bring home money to his family. The picture offers an arresting portrait of a fellow flying free and yet spiraling downward, but the story is bigger than just that. It's about modern men and the ways they try to maintain self-esteem in a business climate that's increasingly arcane, monolithic and impersonal. Time Out is wonderful in its bleakness. As Vincent, Recoing, a French stage actor in his first major movie riole, is the picture of the middle-aged dad with the briefcase, the trench coat and the cell phone. He is constantly on the road. He finds solitude in the interior of his car, in hotel rooms or abandoned houses, but there's never any getting away from the sound of the highway in the distance. It's always present, like breathing. Cantet has said of his film that when Vincent pretends to be a U.N. consultant, we're seeing him at his most alive. But nothing in the movie makes us identify the U.N. position as all that better than any other job. Indeed, the sad and affecting thing about Vincent's fantasy is just how un-fantastic it is. He talks about expanding markets and market research, and it all sounds substanceless and oppressive. Is this what men were meant to be doing? Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Documentary. Directed by Bruce Hendricks. (PG. 39 minutes. At the Loews Metreon IMAX Theater.) Abetter title for this film would be Penultimate X. Instead of a full- length documentary about ESPN's wildly popular Summer X Games, we get a brief overview that's not much longer than a late-night infomercial. (Thirty-nine minutes? Name another major release that's just 39 minutes.) Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games, we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized. And yet Ultimate X deserves praise for capturing on film -- with incredible angles and camera shots -- the leaps, spills, crowds, tension and craziness that define the X Games, which have become as important to American youth as MTV and Harry Potter. True, scores of adults are attracted every year to the X Games venues, where bikers, skateboarders, in-line skaters, motorcyclists and other competitors zip and zoom into the air, over dirt and around walls and corners. And it's true that some of the X Games athletes are in their 20s and even 30s. But as one of them says in Ultimate X, it's the younger competitors who are the X Games' focus because they always push the boundaries of what is possible. It's younger people who will love this brief movie and thrill to the loud music that accompanies every flip, crash and successful landing by such X Games stars as Travis Pastrana, Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Carey Hart, Cory Nasty Nastazio and T.J. Lavin. All of these stars are legends to their fans, one of whom is quoted as saying, Tony Hawk is God. He isn't, but this movie doesn't have time to explain everything. -- Jonathan Curiel Black comedy. Starring Marie-Josee Croze and Jean-Nicolas Verreault. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. (Not rated. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Maelstrom is a compelling parable from Canada that's open to a number of interpretations. On the surface, it's a black comedy that says the usual things about fate being perverse and life being meaningless. But go a layer deeper and Maelstrom is all about the consequences of irresponsibility, a movie that hides a very moral, focused point of view behind a veneer of what- the-hell hipness. The film is narrated by a fish about to go to market. Within minutes, his head is going to be chopped off, a choice not merely fey or comic. In this sly, intelligent film, everything is there for a reason. Writer-director Denis Villeneuve has sympathy even for the fish on a butcher's block. His film is pro-life in the most sophisticated way. We first meet our heroine, Bibiane (Marie-Josee Croze), as she's in the process of getting an abortion. The 25-year-old owner of several high-end fashion shops in Montreal, she suffers several business reversals, consoles herself by getting drunk -- and kills a man in a drunken-driving accident on her way home from a dance club. The rest of the movie is about how Bibiane deals with the death and attempts to give her life a makeover. Yet to say only that makes Maelstrom sound like a dramatic tale of moral regeneration. In fact, the tone is light, funny and fantastic, not unlike that of, say, Amelie. For Villeneuve, the consequences of irresponsibility may be death, but he doesn't presume to prescribe rules, nor does he shy away from absurdity. Maelstrom accepts and lingers on the rich coincidences and ironies of life as it's actually lived. Villeneuve's affection extends to all the characters but particularly Bibiane who, in another writer's hands and with a less charming actress playing her, could easily have been unsympathetic: a beautiful little rich girl, whose father gave her everything. But did he? According to Villeneuve, there are lessons everyone has to learn. Maelstrom is an original little film about one young woman's education. Advisory: This film contains nudity, sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy. Starring DJ Qualls, Eliza Dushku. Directed by Ed Decter. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) You can tell when the makers of The New Guy get desperate. It's when they plop Eliza Dushku on a mechanical bull or show a montage of her trying on bikinis. In this lame, haphazard teen comedy, the dark-eyed sexpot from Bring It On is the only sure thing. The most outrageous act required of Dushku, however, is having to kiss DJ Qualls, who plays a high school geek transformed into a stud. Qualls was fabulous as the goofball virgin in Road Trip, but he was a novelty act in that movie, not the star. He has to carry The New Guy, which is almost unfair. A string bean with a giraffe neck and sad smile, he's so physically awkward that watching him strut is unsettling instead of funny. He also looks too old for the role. It doesn't help that he's stuck at Cliche High. His character, who pines for a cheerleader and is bullied by her jock boyfriend, gets himself expelled so he can switch schools and pursue another cheerleader (Dushku) with a jock boyfriend. Wouldn't it be refreshing if just once, a cinematic high school goober chased a girl his speed? Before he makes it to the new school, Qualls lands in the pen with Eddie Griffin. The crime of defacing school property probably wouldn't get him prison time, but let's not quibble, since Griffin offers the film's only signs of life. He bites into the role of a nutty con who teaches Qualls to act tough, which mostly entails mad-dog stares and the repeated lighting of a Zippo. Qualls is in prison, then he's in high school, then back in prison, without any explanation. The New Guy, apparently, is following the new school of film comedy established by The Sweetest Thing in which continuity is discarded for random gags. The mechanical-bull interlude comes out of nowhere, as do visual references to Braveheart and even the modest teen comedy Can't Hardly Wait. These tired elements highlight the lack of imagination of director Ed Decter and writer David Kendall. Lyle Lovett and Illeana Douglas appear as Qualls' father and guidance counselor, and they share the quality of having checked out. Lovett continues to be a wonderful singer and a terrible actor, and Douglas' touchy-feely act is a pale imitation of her art teacher in the vastly superior teen comedy Ghost World. Maybe Lovett and Douglas just wanted to hang out with Tommy Lee, Vanilla Ice, Henry Rollins and skateboarder Tony Hawk, all of whom make cameos. The movie might be a dud, but the set probably was a hoot. Advisory: This film contains vulgar humor. -- Carla Meyer Drama. Starring Kris Kristofferson, Robert Sean Leonard, Natasha Richardson and Uma Thurman. Directed by Ethan Hawke. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With most movies that fail, the fault can be ascribed to carelessness or lack or inspiration or cynicism. But Chelsea Walls, directed by actor Ethan Hawke, is clearly a labor of love. His camera pans up and down the faces of his actors as though he wants to kiss them or at least touch them gently with the backs of his fingers. There's no question he's happy to be filming them and happy to be shooting in the historic Chelsea Hotel, and yet none of that translates into a movie that's worth watching. In fact, some of that enthusiasm translates into scenes that are torture to sit through. Chelsea Walls is hampered -- no, paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script (adapted by Nicole Burdette from her own play) that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire: I want to put my power into a poem to burn a hole in your pocket so I can sew it, one woman says. She ought to leave the guy's pants alone. The narrative is nonexistent. Instead we get a series of little scenes involving various characters in various rooms. Hawke tries to capture the flavor of the hotel, which has attracted artists since early in the past century. He succeeds in making the hotel seem like the most boring place on earth. Hawke has brought together a talented cast, including Vincent D'Onofrio, Robert Sean Leonard, Kris Kristofferson, Uma Thurman (Hawke's wife) and Steve Zahn. The actors are game, but invariably the scenes trail off into ambiguity and irresolution. Nothing happens. Frank Whalley plays a lounge singer. He introduces a song, but the scene ends before he sings it. That's typical. The other typical thing is for scenes to play long past their natural life. Advisory: This film contains strong language. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"'Yossi and Jagger' Drama. Starring Ohad Knoller, Yehuda Levi. Directed by Eytan Fox. Written by Avner Bernheimer. (Not rated. 71 minutes. In Hebrew with English subtitles. At the Lumiere and Act theaters in Berkeley). Based on a true story and written for the screen by Avner Bernheimer, Yossi and Jagger captures the camaraderie and nervous energy of young soldiers at war. At a snowy outpost on the Israel-Lebanon border, the quarters are cramped, danger lurks around every corner, and sexual high jinks and general silliness take precedence over preparing for battle. Spirits run high despite the troops' exhaustion. It's biological warfare!  an army cook cries upon discovering the food in the camp fridge has spoiled. Two soldiers, crouched and ready to take on the enemy, kill time with a game of who's better: Popeye or Brutus? Michelle Pfeiffer or Sharon Stone? Secret lovers Yossi and Jagger (Ohad Knoller and Yehudi Levi), desperate for time alone, embark on a mission into the wilderness, and director Fox exploits the winter backdrop for a lustrous, truly romantic love scene. Much of the scene's power comes from seeing Knoller's Yossi, the butch company commander, melt in the presence of his beau. Yossi's affectionate glances turn to flickers of shame once the pair are back at camp, in front of others. Levi brings an impish charm to Jagger, but the character (nicknamed after the rock star) is more described than he is played. His fellow soldiers talk about how great he is, but he doesn't talk much himself, and when he does, it's mostly to berate Yossi about being closeted. Levi is a big soap star in Israel, so maybe his character's charms could be assumed when the film played in his home country. Another soldier fancies a female colleague, but she's got a big crush on Jagger. Assi Cohen makes palpable this fellow's sexual frustration and his anger at having to compete with sensitive Jagger. The Betty Grable of the outfit, a saucy radio operator named Goldie, is shtupping the unit's married colonel -- an affair conducted practically in the open. Illicit heterosexuality, apparently, is far preferable to committed homosexuality in the Israeli military. -- Advisory: This film contains raw language, violence, sexual situations. -- Carla Meyer 'I Vitelloni'A year before La Strada brought director Federico Fellini international renown, he made I Vitelloni, a semi-autobiographical film about a group of 30-ish buddies in a small, Adriatic town who are loafing and wasting their lives. Literally, the title means big veals or overgrown calves -- these fellows have never been out of the crate. They like the crate. The film finds the director at an ideal juncture in his career. Having mastered his technique and absorbed the lessons of Italian Neo-Realism, Fellini is feeling his way toward his own vision, but carefully, without the abandoned self-indulgence that would characterize his later work. It's a film of sensitivity, observation and humor - a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less taken by the maestro may find I Vitelloni to be a favorite among his works. The five vitelloni presented here have big plans and outsized egos, the latter the result of indulgent mamas, and yet these men don't work and instead spend their time pursuing women. At the film's center is Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), a ladies' man who is forced into marriage with a pregnant girl, Sandra (Leonora Ruffo), whose beauty and purity of spirit would be enough to melt most cold hearts. Unfortunately, though charming, gregarious and not exactly evil, Fausto suffers from a fatal lack of reverence that causes him to miss completely the value of things. He's so ethically obtuse that he steals a religious statue, an angel, and tries to pedal it to a convent and a monastery. The men talk of going to Rome or Milan, to make something of themselves, but it's a dream - or worse, something in place of a dream, a cover story. The buffoonish Alberto (Alberto Sordi) won't ever leave his mother, and Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste), for all his talk of becoming a playwright, lacks the rigor of an artist. He's more attracted to the image. The only one there's hope for is the sensitive Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi), who watches Fausto's antics with growing disgust. The carnival scene and its aftermath - with Alberto drunkenly wandering, haunted by a clown's head, while a musician plays a loud trumpet riff, over and over -- is a hint of Fellini to come, as are other scenes. Here's the question: Is I Vitelloni the work of an artist whose vision is just flowering -- or that of an artist whose vision has fully ripened and is about to decay? I can't decide. In any case, this 50-year-old film is a blessedly concise and emotionally satisfying work. -- Mick LaSalle 'The Singing Forest'There isn't much singing in The Singing Forest, but there is sure a lot of whining. Writer-director Jorge Ameer's bare-bones vanity project has one incredible premise, one that is so ridiculous and over-the-top it would have been difficult to take his film seriously even if the rest of the film's elements were top-notch (they are not). Christopher (Jon Sherrin), a magazine journalist who is drinking heavily after the death of his wife of 22 years, goes to his daughter's house to meet her fiance, Ben (Craig Pinkston). Christopher has become convinced, after a recent visit to a psychic, that he was a German resistance fighter hanged by the Nazis during World War II. And when he meets Ben, he is equally convinced that his daughter's fiance is the reincarnation of his gay lover. So the creepy, boozing and much older Christopher sets about seducing his daughter's lover. Ameer is obviously riffing off a scene in the acclaimed documentary about the persecution of homosexuals by the Nazis, Paragraph 175. The singing forests described in that documentary were the screams of victims mounted on poles. If that seems tasteless, it is. So are the various other sundry plot revelations -- for example, it turns out that Christopher met his wife and conceived Destiny, his daughter, by raping her. What a guy. Most perplexing of all is Destiny (Erin Leigh Price). Here is a young woman whose mother has recently died, and whose fiance is sleeping with her father - and she seems OK with it. No emotional scenes, no arguments with Dad, no commiserating over her mother's passing. Apparently, she's just in it for her name. -- Advisory: This film has strong language and homosexual sex scenes that are suggestive rather than explicit. -- G. Allen Johnson ",1
"(L-r) Channing Tatum as Caine Wise and Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones in Jupiter Ascending.” Illustrates FILM-JUPITER-ADV06 (category e), by Stephanie Merry © 2015, The Washington Post. Moved Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2015. (MUST CREDIT: Murray Close/Warner Bros. Entertainment.)(L-r) Channing Tatum as Caine Wise and Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones in Jupiter Ascending.” Illustrates FILM-JUPITER-ADV06 (category e), by Stephanie Merry © 2015, The Washington Post. Moved Wednesday, Feb.Almost every movie about the future is really about the present. In “Star Trek,” the universe of competing powers — the Federation versus the Romulans and Klingons — was really just a blown-out version of the Cold War, with NATO pitted against China and the Soviet Union.Nearly 50 years later, Andy and Lana Wachowski make entertainment out of a host of modern anxieties in “Jupiter Ascending,” envisioning a future universe in which a handful of elites control technology and can live indefinitely. Meanwhile, the great masses of people live short, manipulated lives of meaninglessness and doom. “Jupiter Ascending” is a film very much of its moment, in ways both good and bad. But the important thing is that its virtues are extraordinary, while its flaws are easy to forget because they’re so common. Many of the action sequences, showing various spacecraft descending into cities to fly between buildings, are dull and not well choreographed. Watching them is like staring at a big computer screen. How many times have you heard that?But the Wachowskis must be given credit for being smart and for creating, out of their byzantine ruminations on existence, something that’s mostly fun to watch. Anyone who believes in conspiracies, or wonders about other dimensions, or loves technology, or is freaked out by technology, or questions what we call reality, or wonders how the world got started will find evidence in “Jupiter Ascending” that the Wachowskis have been thinking about all that, too. But they’ve been thinking longer, and better.It may take more than one viewing to understand the whole setup, but the essential thing to know is that there is a young scrub woman in Chicago, Jupiter (Mila Kunis), who gets up every morning at 4:45 a.m. to make beds and clean toilets. She seems like an average person, but in fact there is a powerful entity on the other side of the universe who absolutely wants her dead.This is something else great about the Wachowskis: They know everyone will identify with this, because they understand the insane combination of boundless paranoia and grandiosity that is within every human being. Soon, creepy little guys — the evil cousins of the “Close Encounters” aliens — show up to kill her, but she is rescued by Caine (Channing Tatum), who is half wolf and half man. The man part makes him feasible, and the wolf part makes him dangerous, so he’s ideal boyfriend material. In “Jupiter Ascending,” the Wachowskis provide the audience with information on a need-to-know basis, so to describe what follows is to impart more understanding than the viewer should have. Suffice it to say, Caine is working for powerful entities, and Jupiter’s task, almost from start to finish, is to navigate the politics and shifts in a universe she barely understands.The first hint that “Jupiter Ascending” is something more than “John Carter” with star appeal is a long conversation between Jupiter and Kalique (Tuppence Middleton), a member of the universe’s ruling family. Kalique, a cheerful woman with a motherly appeal, lays out the joys and possibilities of living in this new world. Her description is genuinely seductive. Yet implicit in everything she says is a blithe, underlying cruelty.Eddie Redmayne, as the most ambitious of the ruling elite, almost qualifies on his own as a reason to see the movie. He plays a neurasthenic monster, a cousin to every Caligula who has ever chewed the scenery, and his mode is to speak in a breathy mumble and then, occasionally, just scream out of nowhere. In a way, it’s an amazingly horrible performance, an example of what can happen when an easy-going young actor makes the mistake of doing whatever his directors tell him. Going into the Oscar vote, in which Redmayne is Michael Keaton’s chief competitor, Keaton really should be sending the Wachowskis a fruit basket. Perhaps flowers, too, but at minimum a basket with nice pears, different kinds of apples and maybe a pineapple.Yet here’s the thing: If Redmayne were truly horrible in “Jupiter Ascending,” why is he one of the most enjoyable things about it? As charming as Kunis is — she has a wit and comic timing that reminds me a little of Carole Lombard — people will be walking out of the movie talking about Redmayne, and no one will be sorry they saw him.And few will be sorry to have seen “Jupiter Ascending.” The Wachowskis have devised a compelling universe, and if they want to continue exploring it for a sequel or two, well, for once that’s probably a good idea.

(HANDOUT PHOTO)(Left to right) Samuel L. Jackson as Doyle Gipson and Ben Affleck as Gavin Banek in Changing Lanes. Paramount Pictures presents Changing Lanes, a Scott Rudin Production. (HANDOUT PHOTO)CHANGING LANES: Drama. Starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Roger Michell. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Today, when most people think of film noir, they think of movies with gullible men taken in by hard, bad women like Jane Greer or Barbara Stanwyck. Modern noirs, responding to the obvious, have mainly focused on the dark side of sex, but noir was always about more than that. Noir is really about moral choices -- the difficulty of being a good person in a world whose every motion seems to reinforce corruption and conformity. Changing Lanes is a successful movie largely because of its willingness to work this deeper side of the noir tradition. Here characters have more to fear from the darkness inside themselves than from the actions of other people. Something happens -- and from there the lives of two men go into a tailspin. Or as one of them puts it, in a sentiment worthy of Dick Powell in a fedora, Sometimes God likes to take two guys, put 'em in a paper bag and let 'em rip. Ben Affleck plays Gavin, a hotshot lawyer, and Samuel Jackson plays Doyle, a struggling middle-class man estranged from his family. One morning, the two men get into an accident on New York's FDR Drive. The lawyer isn't a bad guy, but in true noir form, he commits a single bad action from which everyone's troubles derive. In his haste to get to court, he strands Doyle on the highway. As a result, Doyle misses a custody hearing and loses the right to see his children. The consequences are also bad for Gavin. He gets to court only to find that he left an all-important file at the accident scene. Unless he recovers the file by the end of the day, he could go to jail. And Doyle has it. So that's Changing Lanes. One guy has a file. The other needs it. One guy hates the other's guts. The other just wants his file back. The rest of the movie is a study in character and escalating mayhem. The characters make the film compelling and make every misfortune seem inevitable. It's a nice touch that Doyle is a complicated and troubled man, not a villain or a mere victim. He is an angry, tightly wound recovering alcoholic who, with regard to his family, has been the author of his own misery. Affleck plays the more traditional noir hero. One mistake leads to another, and the next thing he knows he's committing fraud and extortion. He is in the noir spiral, spinning out of control, circling the moral drain. As is usual in noir, there's a woman involved, and Changing Lanes comes up with an interesting one -- Amanda Peet as Gavin's demure wife, who for all her primness embraces the fundamental immorality of Gavin's life as a Wall Street lawyer and asks her husband to embrace it, too. Can you live there with me? In such moments, Changing Lanes is more chilling than The Devil's Advocate, in which Satan ran a law firm. Here, the movers and shakers are people like Gavin's wife and genial fellows like Sydney Pollack as Gavin's boss. The evil is casual and pleasant, visible to anyone who can see past the surface. Changing Lanes was co-written by first-time screenwriter Chap Taylor, from his own story, but the influence of co-writer Michael Tolkin is unmistakable. Tolkin wrote The Player and The Rapture, both bleak morality tales. Director Roger Michell (Notting Hill), meanwhile, lends the film an eeriness that's only made more eerie by the sight of the World Trade Center's twin towers in the background. (The movie was filmed in the first months of 2001.) At its best, watching Changing Lanes is like watching controlled madness. In some scenes, the soundtrack quietly plays just a single note underneath the action, the sonic equivalent of stretched piano wire -- when will it snap? In the end, Changing Lanes doesn't fully commit itself to its noir sensibility. It doesn't stretch that wire as far as it will go. But for a Ben Affleck movie, this is fairly adventurous stuff. Advisory: This film contains strong language. ",1

Musical drama. Starring John Magaro, Jack Huston, Will Brill, James Gandolfini and Bella Heathcote. Directed by David Chase. (R. 112 minutes.)Writer-director David Chase, best known for The Sopranos, has made a feature film about a rock band's struggles to make it big in the 1960s, but Chase's real concern is the '60s themselves, not the band. He is interested in the culture's journey, how people began the decade and how they ended up. And the point he wants to make is best conveyed in a pair of wordless scenes, one near the beginning and one near the finish, and both involving James Gandolfini watching television. If you're familiar with similar scenes in The Sopranos, you know that no one watches TV quite like Gandolfini, whose face barely moves a muscle, and yet his thoughts are clear to all. In the first scene, he is a husband and father watching the Rolling Stones singing Time Is on My Side (it sure was) on a variety show, and you know he's marveling that anyone could take these skinny degenerates seriously. He is sure in his judgments, and he has a black-and-white TV set. Some five or six years later, he is by himself watching the Bali Hai number in the movie South Pacific. The world is in color now, and so he has a color set. And though his face is deadpan, his eyes suggest a longing for what the song promises. No longer sure he knows everything, he is thinking that maybe life isn't all about wearing blinders and working hard, that maybe people are entitled to something splendid, and the convention he has lived by is a trap. A quiet revolution has taken place in his mind, and this revolution is, in short, the 1960s. Not Fade Away is a movie by a filmmaker who treasures his memories, cares about social history and relishes getting it right. The early 1960s may seem quaint from a distance, but through Chase's eyes we can recognize the insolence of the early Stones and the sexual current in early rock 'n' roll. He persuades the audience to feel what it must have been like when this stuff was new. This is no small accomplishment, making something fresh of something dated. As Douglas, a teenager who joins a band and blossoms as a result, John Magaro becomes a prototype of the young person of that era, condescending to his parents, proclaiming himself an artist and talking to adults as if they're all idiots - though many of them are; that's the difficulty. It was a time of the generation gap, when the kids were insufferable and the parents didn't have a clue about anything. At one point a girl asks her mother if she can switch from pads to tampons, and the mother explodes, Try convincing your (future) husband it was just tampons! Of course, it's not just a generic 1960s that Chase is offering, but the specific '60s that he experienced as an Italian American in New Jersey, which was a little more vocal than an Anglo-Saxon household. He gets the big things right and the little things, too: At one point, Douglas is dipping a piece of ham or bologna into a mayonnaise jar, while his mother makes antipasto - a slice of life, not just lunch meat. A lot finds its way in here: Sexual mores in transition, as expressed through Douglas' relationship with his girlfriend (Bella Heathcote). The changing sound and atmosphere surrounding rock 'n' roll. Vintage musical numbers. The transformation brought about by the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album. The drug casualties. How families often hurt more than they helped. And the golden allure of California. Chase doesn't know how to end the movie - he didn't know how to end The Sopranos, either, come to think of it - but at least he doesn't impose an ending that distorts the characters. He just ends it. The movie is going along nicely, and after 112 minutes (with about a five-minute warning) he pulls the plug. So there's none of the joy of a great finish, but there is a lot to admire throughout, especially Gandolfini as the dad, a poignant figure for whom the '60s finally came, but about a quarter century too late.",1
"** ADVANCE FOR THURSDAY APRIL15 **Actress Uma Thurman appears in a scene from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: VOL. 2, in this undated promotional photo. (AP Photo/Andrew Cooper, Miramax Films) Uma Thurman holds a serious grudge in &quo;Kill Bill: Vol. 2.&quo;** ADVANCE FOR THURSDAY APRIL15 **Actress Uma Thurman appears in a scene from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: VOL. 2, in this undated promotional photo. (AP Photo/Andrew Cooper, Miramax Films) Uma ThurmanKill Bill: Vol. 2. Starring Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Still, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 stands alone as a witty and entertaining action movie, always clever and sometimes gripping, though at times also ponderous and self-indulgent. The hideous violence of the first installment is absent, and the overall feeling is less like '70s kung fu and more like Sergio Leone. This time we even get to see Bill, in the form of David Carradine, whose searching eyes set within a rucked and seamed face suggest both utter depravity and a self-awareness bordering on the spiritual. All of Tarantino's strengths and weaknesses can be found in Vol. 2. As a thinker, as a philosopher, just as someone responding to life on earth, Tarantino is a cipher. He has nothing to say, and in the few places in which he seems to invest in the emotional reality of his characters, it's as pathetic to witness as the sight of some mentally arrested adult conversing with a stuffed animal. Yet, in terms of pure filmmaking skill, how many directors can lay a glove on this guy? And how many screenwriters can come up with anything as loony and delightful as Tarantino's throwaway conversations - - for example the one here in which Michael Madsen, as a strip-joint bouncer, is berated by his boss for wearing a cowboy hat? So we take what we can get from Kill Bill: Vol. 2, and there's much to enjoy. The Bride (Uma Thurman), back from an eventful trip to Japan, is still holding a grudge about being shot in the head and left for dead by Bill and his gang. Talking directly into the camera, as she breezes along in a car, she recommits herself to her agenda. First she will kill Budd (Madsen). Then she will kill the ruthless and feral Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). And then, she says, I'm going to kill Bill! A flashback to the Bride's wedding rehearsal -- which ended in a massacre -- serves to remind us not only of the story but also of Tarantino's instinctive dramatic sense. Because the audience knows that, within moments, everyone in the church will be slaughtered, he impishly allows banal conversations to play themselves out, thus building a giddy suspense. Bill makes his appearance, playing a recorder on the porch of this country church, and as soon as we see Carradine, we know that Bill has been worth the buildup. He's magnetic and menacing, a mix of pride and self-disgust, rage and exhaustion. He's not a man to cross. Tarantino eventually brings the scene to its foreordained conclusion, but in an unexpected way. Though Kill Bill: Vol. 2 has a Chorus Line-type structure -- i.e., everybody gets his or her turn, not to talk, in this case, but to get killed - - Vol. 2 is less programmatic than Vol. 1. Throughout, Tarantino has story surprises up his sleeve, and his digressions, unlike the boring sword- making, anime and Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) episodes in Vol. 1, have wit and an integral function. The flashback to the Bride's martial arts training, under the ancient master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu), works on its own terms and also as a zany parody. Tarantino's use of Thurman is uninspired. He's clearly fascinated by her, but he doesn't transmit that fascination or deepen our understanding of Thurman as a screen presence. He does, however, bring out a certain amused Mitchum-like fatalism in Madsen, and he finds the fierceness in the usually ethereal (and sometimes bland) Hannah. It's also fair to say that his work with Carradine is revelatory. Obviously, this is a major screen actor. But who knew? In the last half hour, Tarantino indulges himself. There's a sequence involving a Mexican pimp that plays like a DVD outtake, and the Bride's encounter with Bill goes on and on. Tarantino insists on telling us every thought he has ever had about these characters, but he's the only one who takes them seriously. Still, the movie never stalls, and considering all the fun Tarantino has given us to this point, the impulse is to cut him some slack. All he has to do is trim a full hour out of Vol. 1 and a half hour out of Vol. 2, combine what's left and he'll have something not just amusing and idiosyncratic, but outstanding. -- Advisory: This film contains graphic violence and strong language.

"102 DALMATIANS: Children's movie. Starring Glenn Close and Alice Evans. Directed by Kevin Lima. (Rated G. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For the adults, there is but one attraction, but it's a substantial one -- Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil. 102 Dalmatians, which opens today, is the sequel to the live-action 101 Dalmatians from 1996. Directed by Kevin Lima (Tarzan), it is far and away the better of the two Dalmatians for a number of reasons. At the top of the list is that in this one Cruella gets to cut loose. Screenwriters Kristen Buckley and Brian Regan have come up with an amusing premise: Cruella De Vil has been rehabilitated. She leaves prison asking that people call her Ella, not Cruella and pledges to devote herself to animal rights. If Close is funny as the evil Cruella, she is even funnier as the kindly Cruella, doing her best to suppress her inexhaustible capacity for irritation and rage. Watching her is not unlike watching footage of Maria Callas, that other grand diva, trying to smile for the press. One knows that at any moment the smile will grow fangs and heads will be bitten off. The screenwriters do something else that's wise. They don't try to squeeze 102 dalmatians into the film. They also don't return to the original dog- obsessed family (played in the first film by Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson). Instead, they devise an entirely new story about a dalmatian- loving probation officer, Chloe (English actress Alice Evans), who has the dubious luck of being assigned to Cruella's case. Evans has the good looks and aura of kindness and sanity that had a way of calming my nerves back in elementary school. She radiates intelligence as well, in contrast to Ioan Gruffudd, who as her boyfriend Kevin acts more big-eyed and sweet than a neutered puppy. The earlier part of the picture, in which Cruella tries to reform, are the best. The fun comes in watching her restrain herself, playing against her own nature. In one scene, she holds a formal dinner for dog-lovers and their pets. She allows the dogs to walk all over the banquet table while she laughs maniacally. The transformation of Ella back into Cruella does not disappoint. It comes in the form of a kind of breakdown, in which Cruella suddenly sees all of London -- the sky, the streets, the cars, the people -- as white with black spots. This time out, Cruella is not just mean. She is one sick puppy. The second half of the film is not as satisfying, but it holds together. Gerard Depardieu, one of the least vain actors around, shows up as Le Pelt, a temperamental French furrier. Close and Depardieu chew up the scenery, but Depardieu also chews chicken wings and any other food that's not nailed down. The film's title is justified by the fact that 102 dalmatians are needed for Cruella and Le Pelt to succeed in their diabolical plan -- to make a stylish outfit, made up entirely of dalmatian skin. I'll think of you every time I wear one of your sweet little doggies, Cruella tells Chloe. When Cruella is not onscreen, things tend to bog down, and the last half hour, heavy on action, is the weakest. Adhering to the formula of the previous film, the movie indulges in an overlong slapstick bit. It also tries to make a hero of Oddball, a dalmatian with no spots. Still, in every kids' picture, there are going to be sections that only kids will enjoy. Fortunately, 102 Dalmatians has enough for the adults, too. ",1
"11:14: Black comedy. Starring Rachael Leigh Cook, Hilary Swank, Patrick Swayze and Shawn Hatosy. Directed by Greg Marcks. (Rated R. 85 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Why would famous actors take small parts in an independent film with no guarantee of its ever being released? It had to be the script. Marcks came up with something fresh: A man (Henry Thomas) is driving down the road, somewhat drunk, when he hits somebody at 11:14 p.m. We see that situation unfold, and then we go back in time on a number of occasions to meet other characters, all of them related in unexpected ways to that accident. By the end of the movie, all the loose ends are tied up, and we have a full understanding of what really took place at 11:14 in this suburban town. If 11:14 were merely a puzzle-like construction it would be of limited appeal. What makes it so successful is that Marcks doesn't just have a novel way of telling his story; he has a really good story to tell. Most of the characters operate according to secret motives and their lives become entwined, not by mere chance, but as a direct consequence of the actions they take. Swank plays Buzzy, a hapless store clerk, probably the only truly ingenuous character in the film. On the opposite side of the spectrum there's Cheri (Rachael Leigh Cook), a young woman juggling at least two guys, for reasons not immediately clear. As a director, Marcks does a number of things quite well. He establishes a difficult tone -- part dramatic, part comic, part absurdist -- and he maintains it throughout. In terms of the filming, I particularly like the way he conveys the first accident. It happens very quickly. We don't quite know what happened, but we think we know what we saw. We also know that the driver thinks something else happened, and we're not sure if he's right or we're right. There's just enough ambiguity there to hold our attention, and yet enough information for audiences to develop an independent point of view. -- Advisory: This film contains violence, simulated sex and strong language.

"13 Going on 30: Comedy. Starring Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo and Judy Greer. Directed by Gary Winick. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The passage of those years raises questions: Has our girl really traveled through time or is she, in fact, suffering from a trauma that makes her unable to remember anything that happened after age 13? Is the movie a fantasy or a psychological rumination? Either way, 13 Going on 30 provides a lighthearted, amusing and yet mostly honest version of a daydream most of us have had at one time or another. If our young selves visited us today, would they like what they see? Jennifer Garner plays Jenna, the 13-year-old in the 30-year-old body, but in the beginning Jenna is an awkward kid (Christa B. Allen) -- the sort of kid who could easily blossom into a beauty, though it would take an adult to notice. Smart, ambitious and different, she also shows early signs of skewed values, in her longing to be accepted by a popular sextet of snobby, nasty girls. I don't want to be original, she tells her long-suffering friend, Matt (Sean Marquette). I want to be cool. Though the first scenes of the movie are set in 1987, director Gary Winick presents a world that reads more early than late '80s. The opening credits are accompanied by the 1984 Go-Go's hit Head Over Heels, and, except for one brief exception (Belinda Carlisle's Mad About You), every song referenced is from the first part of the decade: Burnin' Down the House,  Crazy for You, Jessie's Girl. Jenna even has a crush on Rick Springfield, who was no longer big in 1987. And two songs that figure prominently in the movie are from 1982: Michael Jackson's Thriller and Pat Benatar's Love Is a Battlefield. The disparity leaves the impression of a screenplay written years ago and never updated. Jenna gets the chance to be 30 after a disastrous birthday party that makes her wish, with all her might, that she might escape adolescence altogether. Next thing, she's waking up in 2004, in a luxury Manhattan apartment and in an adult woman's body. She sees herself in the mirror and screams. A man gets out of her shower, and she flees. A car, waiting for her outside her apartment, whisks her off to her job, but she has no idea what she's doing. The possibilities of Jenna's confusion are exploited for full comic effect. Garner, who turns out to be a charming, abandoned comedian, makes Jenna's incredulousness and innocence very funny and occasionally even touching. She walks with the awkwardness of a teenager and adopts a young teenager's manner, her diffidence giving way to flashes of manic energy. Between the laughs, there's a hint of hardness to 13 Going on 30. Jenna's reunion with Matt -- who has grown from a chubby kid into Mark Ruffalo (America's heartthrob for women with high IQs) -- has an element of discomfort to it. Somewhere between 13 and 30, she apparently treated him badly, and so he's reserved. As the details of Jenna's life emerge, it's clear that the 30-year-old has everything the child thought worth having, but it's empty. She has no real friends; her underlings at work are terrified of her, and her boyfriend is only good on paper -- a handsome, famous athlete who is also a vacuous imbecile. Given the movie's honesty, it's almost a surprise that Jenna never notices something a little off about the skyline in lower Manhattan. I think 13 Going on 30 blows it at the finish, but most people won't think so. Romantic comedies have certain rules, which surely limited the filmmakers' options. Still, there's something intriguing in this movie's premise that cries out for more serious treatment, if not here, then somewhere else. Just as Fail-Safe was a dramatic version of Dr. Strangelove, a dramatic version of 13 Going on 30 would be welcome. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. ",1
"1408: Supernatural Thriller. Starring John Cusack, Mary McCormack and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Mikael Hafstrom. (PG-13. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings, and to purchase tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) The care that went into 1408 is especially appreciated, as a perfectly acceptable horror movie could have been made on the basis of its premise alone: There's an evil room -- 1408 -- in a New York hotel. No one lasts more than an hour. Fifty-six people have ended up dead, some of suicide, the rest of supposedly natural causes. One woman went insane and blinded herself after 10 minutes. ... Yet Mike Enslin, a popular true-horror writer and debunker, checks in for the night, anyway. He doesn't believe in the occult. He thinks it's all a big joke. Sold yet? But wait, there are embellishments. John Cusack, an enormously engaging actor, plays Enslin, who starts the film as an unhappy, abrupt man who believes in nothing and has a touch of the smart-aleck about him. Within minutes, the audience really wants to see that guy in the room. But that pleasure is delayed and further intensified by a long intervening scene, in which the hotel manager tries and tries to talk him out of it. The manager is played by Samuel L. Jackson, which should be enough to give him pause: This room is bad enough to scare Samuel L. Jackson. But does he listen? Do we want him to listen? The overkill of the buildup is both effective and faintly (and intentionally) ridiculous, culminating in a shot, from inside a long, dark cylindrical safe, as Jackson reaches in his hand to retrieve the key. This is the old stuff, the good stuff, the tried-and-true stuff of shrewdly accomplished audience manipulation. Laugh at the obviousness of it all -- I did -- and yet include yourself in the joke, because there's no walking away from this one. Once Cusack has that key in his hand, the audience is in for the duration. Though 1408 is a more genuinely scary movie than most horror films, it maintains a certain geniality with regard to its audience. Director Mikael Hafstrom (Derailed) never resorts to the cheap device of trying to shock us with disgusting visuals -- or scare us by threatening to disgust us. From start to finish, it remains a pleasure to watch our hero get tortured, and the movie's frights are well-earned: 1408 gets underneath the viewer's skin in a psychological way. In a sense, the triumph of the film is that, having grabbed the audience through its sure-fire cleverness, it engages and holds attention through its complexity. The room is a room of tangible horror. But it's also a chamber of hallucination, a space outside time, and a place where the unconscious is unleashed. At times, it seems like a metaphor for a bad LSD trip. The story does well in providing the protagonist with a painful past and with a longing for the other side that's at least as intense as the audience's. So go for the gimmick, but stay for the ideas and the emotion. At the same time, 1408 doesn't try to insult anyone's intelligence by pretending to be deeper than it is. Why is the room doing this? What is the room? Why is it so evil? There's no satisfactory answer. So the screenwriters answer the question by dismissing it, with a classic use of the MPAA's one free f-word policy for PG-13 pictures. There's nothing more to say, except that Jackson gets the line and he delivers it well. -- Advisory: Psychological unease, threats of violence, frightening scenes, and Samuel L. Jackson dropping the f-bomb. ",1
"15 MINUTES: Crime thriller. Starring Robert De Niro, Edward Burns and Karel Roden. Directed by John Herzfeld. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In 15 Minutes, writer-director John Herzfeld has created a shrewd thriller, in which the American obsession with media fame forms the backdrop. Two Eastern European visitors go on a killing spree. Emil (Karel Roden) does the killing, and Oleg (Oleg Taktarov) records it on his brand-new digital camera. Their plan: to plead insanity and sell the rights to their home movie for a million dollars. On the surface, that kind of story might sound trite or worse -- an opportunity to make an exploitation film masquerading as a sermon against media culture. But Herzfeld's sophisticated understanding of the subject precludes the usual wholesale bashing. Instead, Herzfeld creates a world in which media is the air people breathe. All the characters partake of it. Indeed, all the characters thrive on it, the good and the bad. In a way, that makes for a more profound statement about media pervasiveness than was found in The Truman Show, because at least Truman gets away from his artificial world. In 15 Minutes, there's nothing to escape to. Robert De Niro plays Eddie, a New York detective who has become something of a folk hero thanks to his ability to work the news media. He appears regularly on the show Top Story, run by a sleazy tabloid anchor. His cases make the cover of People magazine, and he gets his face on the local news at every opportunity. In a more pious or typical film, Eddie's media savvy would be a mark against him, an indication that he is in some way compromised. That's not the case here. If anything, it adds to his luster. De Niro plays Eddie with the confidence and swagger of a fellow who knows he's famous. Not the usual rundown middle-aged cop of cliche, Eddie looks successful, and the advice he imparts to a young fire department investigator (Edward Burns) makes sense. He tells him that every little bit of fame makes it easier to do his job. The fire investigator and the homicide detective are thrown together when close examination of a burned-up apartment reveals a double homicide. De Niro and Burns make an appealing pair. There's the New York Italian-Irish rapport (present even though De Niro's last name is Flemming in this one). There's also the old pro-young guy bond. Eddie gives the rookie a hard time, but he takes him under his wing, and he proves himself resourceful -- just as Burns proves that he has the star wattage to share the frame with De Niro. 15 Minutes is a violent film. The body count may be less than in other thrillers, but there's something personal and nasty about the violence here. With his shaved head and snakelike movements, Roden makes Emil an utterly repellent villain. (Just the sight of him smoking a cigarette is grotesque.) He's also frightening. There are several scenes in which Emil is alone in a room with someone, and the audience can see the violence coming. Such moments are excruciating. They can make an audience squirm. Yet, to be fair, 15 Minutes actually suggests more than it shows, by presenting the killings as scenes through the lens of Oleg's shaky camera. The picture is more impressive as it goes along, revealing a symmetry of construction underneath the rudiments of a thriller. Every element has to do with the real subject -- Andy Warhol's elusive 15 minutes of fame that everyone chases. Melina Kanakaredes plays Eddie's girlfriend, a TV reporter who jumps up from the dinner table, as Eddie is about to propose, to go anchor the news. And she's one of the good guys. One of the bad guys is Kelsey Grammer -- who looks like a young clone of Bob Hope. As Hawkins, the unscrupulous tabloid host, Grammer is a villain because he is willing to broadcast a tape of a murder on his show. Good and bad in 15 Minutes is a matter of degree. For all its horrors, the script has moments of wit. Emil and Oleg manage to get along, until they get into a dispute over who was more important in the creation of their home movie -- Oleg, who directed it, or Emil, who starred in it. As the director, Oleg, needless to say, is a strict auteurist. ",1
"1967 French comedy. Written, directed by and starring Jacques Tati. (Not rated. 126 minutes. At the Castro.). In an interview with a German newspaper published Tuesday, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates speculates on life in the near future, including this tidbit about home entertainment: TV will simply show what we want to see when we want to see it. When we get home, the home computer will know who we are from our voice or our face. It will know what we want to watch. Its a future thats intriguing, but scary, too. Sometimes it seems that technology and modernization arent advancing life so much as gradually dissolving the connections between human beings until the individual is isolated in a self-created, artificial world. In a way, the transition to this future is what Jacques Tatis work is all about. Playtime (1967), which opens at the Castro today and plays for a week, is a masterpiece that took him three years to make, much of it on his own dime. It bankrupted him, forcing him to cut the film and sell the rights. For the first time in more than 30 years, Tatis final, restored version is available in its original 70mm format, making it one of the most important film events this year. Like all of Tatis movies, Playtime is virtually plotless, filled with delightful sight gags, keen observations and almost no dialogue. Tatis M. Hulot character tries to keep an appointment at an office in a coldly modern skyscraper. Meanwhile, a group of American tourists hits Paris for 24 hours, but the city they are visiting is much like the one they live in (New York) and the one they just left (Hamburg). Thats because the old Paris has melted away, replaced by modern buildings impressively planned and executed but lacking personality (the only hints of old Paris are in reflection). The parties come together at the opening of a club, a tour de force climax that is one of the great set pieces in movie history. Playtime is sharp and colorful, and visually makes quite an impression. But the sound design truly unique; Tati will often fade conversation (Art Buchwald wrote the English dialogue) into the background and augment quirky sound effects, like the clacking of shoes on the floor or the whoopee cushion- like sound of a modern chair. Its a symphonic, cacophonic achievement in Foley work. Tati made five features and one made-for-television project, but his reputation rests on three remarkable, one-of-a-kind films: M. Hulots Holiday (1953), Mon Oncle (1958) and Playtime. antiquated. Mon Oncle is about the transition from that old, warm, eccentric world to one that is modern, cold and lifeless. In Playtime, that transition complete, thanks to a huge office building and surrounding street, all built for the film (Steven Spielberg acknowledged Tatis influence by building an enormous set for The Terminal and modeling Tom Hanks character partly after the Hulot character). Tati said in an interview that he directed people so that they are following the guidelines of the architects. Everyone operates at right angles to the decor; people feel trapped by it. Playtime, then, is Tatis attempt to answer this question: In the midst of an increasingly impersonal world, how do we keep our humanity? Through the charmingly eccentric, often befuddled M. Hulot, who clearly doesnt fit in this world, we glean some insightful possibilities. -- G. Allen Johnson Documentary. Directed by Harry Thomason and Nickolas Perry. (Not rated. 89 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.). The idea behind The Hunting of the President is that Bill Clinton was the victim of an organized campaign to discredit and undermine him, a campaign put in motion by what Hillary Clinton famously called a vast right-wing conspiracy. When they couldnt get him on money, the thesis goes, the rightwingers got him on sex and staged an impeachment trial that was just a legal attempt at a coup detat. As someone who went into this film with even less sympathy for Clinton than for Andrew Johnson, that other impeached president, I have to say that The Hunting of the President makes a persuasive case. Just the on-camera comments by David Brock, the former conservative journalist who first wrote about Paula Jones sexual harassment allegations, indicates that entire networks of powerful conservatives with big money were determined to break Clinton by every means possible. During the Clinton years, Susan McDougal seemed a shadowy figure, the woman who went to prison because she wouldnt cooperate with the Starr investigation, a female G. Gordon Liddy who, one assumed, knew plenty. But in interviews here, she comes across as sincere and self-effacing, an open book. She says that special prosecutor Kenneth Starrs interrogators offered her immunity in exchange for what they probably knew would had to have been false testimony. She refused. If McDougal is lying in the film  and one can never tell just by looking at people  she should consider a career in Hollywood. McDougal also talks emotionally about Starrs placing her in a maximum- security prison and making her wear a red jumpsuit, clothing that indicated to other prisoners that she was a criminal of the worst kind, a probable child killer. She speaks of this with a surprising lack of bitterness. Starr gets the worst of it. A man who six years ago might have seemed like an honest fellow doing an unpleasant job comes across in The Hunting of the President as spiteful and politically zealous, a 20th century Cotton Mather. In an effort to balance things, albeit halfheartedly, the movie suggests that, if Clinton knew people were out to get him, maybe he should have thought twice before disgracing himself, his wife and his office with a tawdry affair with a vulnerable young intern. But the movie doesnt go far enough and state why it was so easy for many Americans who werent right-wing fanatics to believe the worst of Clinton. From the 1992 primaries, in which he flagrantly lied about political opponents Jerry Brown and Paul Tsongas, through his I did not have sex with that woman declaration, Clintons relationship with veracity was casual at best. So when he actually did tell the truth, who could tell? And when he actually was a victim, how could he be considered an innocent one? Yet for all that  and even acknowledging the fact that the film was co- directed by well-known Clinton friend Harry Thomason  The Hunting of the President tells a scary story. Its about a power grab that almost overturned an election and about a dark element in U.S. political life thats still out there, and flourishing.  Mick LaSalle Documentary. Directed by Jeremy Earp and SutJhally. Narrated by Julian Bond. (Not rated. 68 minutes. At the Roxie; Saturday and Sunday at Auctions by the Bay inAlameda and Wednesday at the Oaks in Berkeley.). Like Fahrenheit 9/11, but free of satire, the gripping documentary Hijacking Catastrophe accuses the Bush administration of exploiting peoples fears of terrorismto justify the invasion of Iraq. The administrations goal, the film contends, is to forge a more powerful U.S. empire through military might. Though unabashedly one-sided, the documentary avoids being didactic and makes its case clearly and forcefully. Filmmakers Jeremy Earp and Sut Jhally skillfully use news footage and documents to show that the Bush Doctrine of pre-emption is in fact based on a plan that was widely criticized when it was first introduced in the early 1990s.Paul Wolfowitz, who crafted the strategy under George Bush Sr., revived it and helped make it policy when he became the current deputy secretary of defense. As for Iraq, the Wolfowitz Doctrine, as it was originally known, had broached the subject of regime change in that country long before Sept. 11, 2001. It was the attacks of that day, many maintain, that gave the Bush administration an excuse to wage war on a sovereign state. All this may not come as news to people whove been reading more than the comics pages, but Earp and Jhally present a strong argument for how the war in Iraq imperils not only the global standing of the United States but also its long-term economic well-being. And interviews with numerous prominent figures, including Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsbergand Norman Mailer, give this sober yet ultimately uplifting documentary an impassioned voice that facts and figures alone cant provide. In one of the films more memorable interviews, Scott Ritter, former chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, tears into the president, calling him Mr. Chicken Hawk. Hes not Gary Cooper, he says. Hes a coward who bushwhacked the American people. Advisory: This film contains graphic images of people injured and killed in warfare. -- John McMurtrie Drama. Directed and co-written (with Tim Kaltenecker) by Todd Stephens. With Sara Rue,Kett Turton, Karen Black, John Doe. (Not rated. 94 minutes. At the Galaxy.). You might think that any picture with Karen Black as a washed-up lounge singer cant be that bad, but Gypsy 83 will give you pause. The lead actress, Sara Rue, is likable, and theres a surprise here and there, but this offering is a mostly undistinguished addition to the long list of films about alienated and self-pitying young people. Blond and zaftig, 25-year-old Gypsy works a lousy job at a foto hut and obsesses about Stevie Nicks while killing time with her best friend, Clive (Kett Turton), 18 years old and gay. Both affect a goth look. They live in, look down on and dream of escaping from Sandusky, Ohio, which, in the view of first-time director ToddStephens, is a noxious amalgam of middle and redneck America. Gypsy isnt the only one obsessing: Stephens has a thing about Sandusky  its his hometown, and this movie is part of a projected trilogy about growing up gay there. Hes also fixated on rock diva Nicks  his first film work was as writer of the coming-of-age story Edge of Seventeen (1998), the title taken from one of Nicks songs. When they arent cavorting in cemeteries (maybe Stephens just saw Easy Rider for the first time?), the misfits pose for each other and commiserate. Learning of the Night of 1,000 Stevies competition  an annual gathering of Nicks imitators in Manhattan  they head for New York in Gypsys vintage Trans Am, encountering in a motel lounge a songbird named Bambi LeBeau (Black), who offers a vision of one possible future for Gypsy. They also meet some repulsive frat boys, one of whom catches Clives eye, and a handsome young Amish man whos looking to break loose. Sexual encounters occur, with predictable results. The film overloads poor Gypsy with issues; shes also trying to come to terms with her mother, who in 1983 abandoned her and her dad (John Doe)  an ex-rocker whos settled for running a music store in Sandusky  for a shot at stardom in the Big Apple. Given all thats thrown at the characters here, its not unexpected that the film comes to a screeching halt instead of a conclusion. Stephens doesnt know how to resolve it all. Along the way, he does pitch us a few curveballs  I liked how he concluded the encounter with the Black character  but not nearly enough. The script isnt much, but theres nice acting by Rue (star of the TV sitcom Less Than Perfect), who infuses some life into these overly familiar situations. She suggests a robust individual trying to grow out of the conventionally angst-ridden freak shesgiven to depict. Turton is less impressive, maybe because his role is so stereotypical. Despite the gay and goth trappings, this is really the same old story about how a boorish world imposes on delicate young eccentrics, and it wont mean a lot to those who dont identify themselves as such. Advisory: This film contains some harsh language and depicts sexual situations. -- Walter Addiego ",1
"28 Days Later: Thriller. Starring Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson. Directed by Danny Boyle. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet the movie falls short two-thirds of the way in. Thereafter, it becomes impossible not to feel the filmmakers' strain -- and feel the story being muscled in odd directions in pursuit of thrills at all cost. By the finish, the movie is getting by on little but adrenaline and audience goodwill. Still, that goodwill runs fairly deep, because, taken all in all, 28 Days Later is a superior motion picture. A dangerous virus is set loose in the first scene, and it's a nice touch that it's the result of monumental stupidity on both sides of the philosophical and political divide. Animal rights activists break into a London laboratory, where crazy scientists have been experimenting with a virus that can demolish civilization. The self-righteous activists want to liberate the chimpanzees being used in these experiments, and they're not willing to listen to the humble lab technician who tries to tell them the consequences. They need to discover those for themselves, which they do within seconds, when the virus gets loose and they find themselves writhing on the floor, vomiting blood. Cut to . . . 28 days later. A bike messenger, Jim (Cillian Murphy), wakes up in a hospital room, alone. He puts on his clothes. No one else is in the entire hospital. He walks out onto a London street, and no one is there either. No one is on the bridge overlooking Big Ben. It's not as if everyone's dead -- there are no dead bodies. There's just no one there. These early scenes, with newspapers blowing across deserted streets like tumbleweed, have a classic look to them. In fact, the primal sense of loneliness they invoke seems almost revelatory. Urban dwellers tend to think of other people as crowds, as traffic. In 28 Days Later, other people are just gone, and to be confronted with that is to share in a kind of grief, as well as to realize how much we liked and needed those other people, after all. Director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, The Beach) shot this feature on digital video, giving it a raw look and allowing for one particularly strong video effect -- the strange, staccato slashing movements of the infected. As they walk, the infected lurch and gain ground at an exaggerated speed, all the while dripping blood from their eyes and trying to tear every healthy person apart. Within 10 to 20 seconds of exchanging bodily fluids with an infected, a healthy person is infected, too. It's the ideal illness for an impatient audience. No time is wasted on any boring incubation period. Jim hooks up with two survivors, Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley); and later with two others, a father (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter, Hannah (Megan Burns). The rest of the movie is about nothing but a struggle for survival against the odds. Screenwriter Alex Garland devises ways to torture the audience in the best way -- as when the fearless band tries to change a tire in a tunnel while scores of infecteds race toward them. At the same time, there are unexpected depths, as when Selena, a hard- bitten character, melts at the interaction of Hannah and her father, as though the mere sight of normal family behavior were an assurance of some lasting value. Christopher Eccleston, enigmatic and aloof, shows up as an Army major, leading a small group of soldiers holed up in an old mansion. Boyle is able to suggest, subtly, a scary male energy at work in the mansion -- and that's about the last subtle thing to be found in 28 Days Later. This film contains graphic violence. ",1
"300: Action drama. Starring Gerard Butler, Lena Headey and Dominic West. Directed by Zack Snyder. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times, and buy tickets for select theaters, at sfgate.com/movies.) Most filmmakers are happy to fulfill only the first challenge -- to make the story relevant, or at least accessible. But the makers of 300, basing their film on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, take the second challenge seriously. They take pains to show the strangeness of Sparta, at least from our perspective -- its brutality, its fanatical obsession with warfare and its code of manhood. The movie thrusts us into this bizarre warlike culture and then, just as we're beginning to get our balance, it surprises us by quickly establishing that these, in fact, are the good guys. The invading Persians are even worse -- mystical, cruel and autocratic, with no proto-democratic traditions. The hairstyles and manners of dress aren't softened for our benefit but are presented with accuracy, with all their jutting beards and braids. If you've ever seen an exhibition of ancient statuary, 300 is like watching marble turn to flesh and blood, and the effect is fascinating. There are probably as many six-pack abs on the men here as you'll find on the statues in Rome's Capitoline Museums. It's worth noting, incidentally, that those sculpted bodies make this one of the great beefcake extravaganzas of 2007. Watching 300, there's the arresting sense of eavesdropping on another time. Things happen that make little sense to us, in terms of our own practices. For example, when King Leonidas -- the commanding Gerard Butler - gets annoyed at a Persian messenger, he kills him and his entire retinue. I particularly like the little grace note: Before he does it, he steals a glance at his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), who nods. We think the nod means Spare them. It means quite the opposite. This is our welcome to Sparta. The movie is letting us know that we've never been to a place like this. Yet for all the film's fidelity to matters of style and culture, director Zack Snyder doesn't offer us a realistic treatment but something more adventurous and intuitive. The colors are exaggerated, sometimes underexposed, sometimes overexposed, sometimes excessively red, sometimes excessively blue. The battle scenes call to mind the film's graphic-novel origins, so that blood never flows like real blood but bursts out in discrete pieces, like rose petals. Significantly, this hyper-stylization of 300 is limited to its visuals. The performances are played straight, and this combination -- straight performances and stylized visuals -- produces an uncanny effect. It's as if the movie is reminding us we're not seeing history as it truly appeared, even if this is history as it happened. We're getting it through the gauze of memory, or legend. This layer of distance, achieved visually, works in many ways. For one thing, it allows viewers to witness the butchery of ancient combat -- the severed arms, legs and heads -- without having to wallow in buckets of gore. It also allows the filmmakers to show these things without worrying about revolting the audience. But this extra distance works in more subtle, emotional ways as well. Because we can never forget we're seeing something foreign to our world -- because we don't get lulled, in the usual movie way, into fusing our reality with that of the characters -- it's easier to take the characters and their behavior on their terms. The distance also creates an underlying sadness. This may be a boisterous movie, lively and full of action, but the director never lets us forget that we're seeing something gone and almost lost to time. You'll notice we're at the end of the review and with little said about the story or the actors. Actually, you know everything you need to know about the story - 300 soldiers versus tens of thousands - and in a movie such as this, the acting takes a backseat both to narrative drive and to the vistas of stone and hard flesh, like something out of a Frank Frazetta painting. However, Butler must be singled out for praise. He played Beowulf recently (Beowulf & Grendel) and didn't fare nearly as well, having to share a girlfriend with an 8-foot monster. Here, working with material worthy of him, he enters into the ancient psychology of the role and comes back every inch a king. -- Advisory: Severed limbs, stylized blood, lots of violence, nudity, simulated Spartan sex.

"49 Up: Documentary. Directed by Michael Apted. (Not rated. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Every seven years since, director Michael Apted has gone back to interview those same kids, the latest result of which is 49 Up, which revisits these former schoolchildren 42 years later, now as 49-year-olds. Taken as a whole, these films constitute one of the greatest uses of cinema a documentary filmmaker has ever devised. Like the other films in the series, 49 Up is alternately touching and mundane, part soap opera, part reality show and part anthropological study. It also qualifies as a bizarre experiment: Does getting filmed every seven years influence the way people live their lives? I suspect not. Just on the most basic level, if I knew I was going to be in a feature film at age 49, I'd make sure I was in great shape for it, even it meant starting training a year in advance. Instead, the people who tended toward chubby seven years ago have all gained weight, in some cases lots of it. In fact, these seven years have been, in general, hard on the physical appearance of many of these subjects. Hair has turned gray, the glow of youth is finally gone. Some people -- such as Tony, the cabdriver -- have barely changed since they were 7. Others are hardly recognizable. The series began as an exploration of the class system in England. It's strong there, and so it's no surprise that the rich kids have led easier lives than the poor kids. Moreover, the children of the poor kids, with rare exceptions, have adopted patterns that will keep them from rising above their parents. Most have chosen not to go to university. Some have had babies out of wedlock and at young ages. The rich kids, who seemed snobby as children, have grown into gracious, self-deprecating adults, friendly and well-mannered, while the poor kids have rougher edges, the product of rougher lives. Yet -- and this is just one sadness pervading the film -- some of the poor kids have grown into extraordinary people, such as Lynn, a librarian for 30 years, and Jackie, who is raising three boys in Scotland. There's no doubt that, had they been born into more prosperous circumstances, there would have been no stopping them. But their lives have been, at least to a large degree, defined by the circumstances into which they entered it. ",1
"A CIVIL ACTION: Drama. Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall. Directed by Steven Zaillian. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That might sound like the premise for a tight legal thriller, but A Civil Action is based on a real-life case, and real-life cases aren't tidy. In place of the tension, climax and easy resolution of the old Perry Mason show, A Civil Action offers murkiness, bitter successes and frustration. Earnest documentaries on PBS specialize in those kinds of tales, but somehow writer-director Steven Zaillian finds a pulse here. He makes A Civil Action into a character study. It becomes a moral journey that happens to be set against a legal background. John Travolta goes on that jour ney as lawyer Jan Schlichtmann, a personal-injury lawyer representing the small-town residents against the polluters. Zaillian wrote the screenplay of Schindler's List, and Schlichtmann, as played by Travolta, emerges as a Schindleresque figure -- a large, imposing, slickly dressed opportunist who accidentally finds his soul. He initially takes the case because he smells money. But as he goes deeper into the case, Schlichtmann begins to see it as a test of his own worth. He wants to prove to himself that he's not an ambulance chaser or a blackmail artist but someone who cares. To do that, he is willing to not only destroy his own career but also take down the fortunes of everyone surrounding him. William H. Macy has the partly comic role of the law firm's legal analyst who gradually becomes a scattered, chain-smoking wreck over the course of the story. Travolta captures the complexity of a man whose motives for doing good have as much to do with vanity as anything else. He plays Schlichtmann as a guy whose understanding of himself is so limited that he often doesn't know why he does what he does. Yet Travolta also lets us see through that to the basic material. We can tell that Schlichtmann is all right, even if he doesn't know it himself. Still, one man's inner journey is small potatoes compared with the other elements of the movie. Zaillian might find his dramatic structure in Schlichtmann's story, but who cares about Schlichtmann when the drinking water is poisoned, kids have cancer and the polluters might get away with it? Zaillian knows that's what the audience real ly cares about, but, limited by the truth of the story, he can only tease us into thinking we're watching a courtroom drama. There are degrees of satisfaction he can't provide. Zaillian also indulges in the obvious, using a glass of water as a recurring visual motif and directing Kathleen Quinlan, who plays the mother of one of the victims, as though she were the Virgin Mary in a '50s biblical epic. We see her in long, still close- ups or floating in and out of scenes with a beatific expression. She gently touches people, offering comfort. Whenever she says something, everyone is speechless. What ultimately saves the film -- and makes sense of A Civil Action as a character study -- is the performance of Robert Duvall as Facher, a lawyer for one of the corporations. Smart and unconventional, Facher listens to Red Sox games on the radio and uses an old satchel instead of a briefcase. He's likable, until we come to realize this is a fellow deliberately holding on to his eccentricities as some kind of weak assurance that he's still a human being. At one point, Facher tells Schlichtmann that morality has nothing to do with the law. He sounds wise and genial, and he truly believes what he's saying. But he's the face of death that Schlichtmann is instinctively turning from, even if he hardly knows why. ",1
"A Christmas Tale: Comedy-drama. Starring Catherine Deneuve, Jean-Paul Roussillon, Mathieu Amalric, Anne Consigny and Melvil Poupaud. Directed by Arnaud Desplechin. In French with English subtitles.  (Not rated. 152 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The great value of families is that we all need people whom we don't have to be nice to. In the business and social worlds, the pressure to be pleasant is constant, and unfiltered honesty has consequences. But in families, moods can turn on a dime. Alliances can be forged, broken and forged again in the course of an afternoon. A visit home can be emotionally exhausting, but it also can be releasing - a release from the pressure of having to imitate a civilized person in every other sphere of life. A Christmas Tale is a realistic and sprawling movie about precisely this phenomenon, presenting us with an extended family in the days leading up to and immediately following Christmas. Like most families, this one has its problems and its bad blood, and in the first 20 minutes or so, writer-director Arnaud Desplechin lays out all the details. If viewers are going to resist A Christmas Tale, it will be in these first minutes. Who wants to sit there keeping track of who is a relative and who is an in-law? Who wants to take a crash course in another family's 40 years of misery? But have patience. Getting through these first 20 minutes is as necessary as plowing through the first 50 pages of a 19th century novel. Once that work is over, the movie's singular pleasures reveal themselves. A Christmas Tale is not like other family movies, to be experienced from a cozy, appreciative distance. Rather, it's like being initiated into another family altogether. Long before it ends, the viewer has a seat at the table and is sleeping on a cot in the spare room. That's how it feels, and that's Desplechin's outstanding accomplishment.  At the center of the movie are the aging parents, played by Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Paul Roussillon. The drama, to the extent there is one, involves the diagnosis of Junon (Deneuve) with a fatal blood disease, which is all but certain to kill her unless she finds a bone marrow donor. In what, at first, seems like a discordant note, Junon is blase about the diagnosis - neither stoic nor blithe, just remarkably casual. Fortunately, this is not a mistake on Desplechin's part, nor an example of Deneuve's refusing to lose her cool on screen. Junon's reaction is in keeping with the movie's tone, which is right on the edge of comedy and drama.  Their kids have a tortured history with each other, which won't be detailed here. Elizabeth, the eldest, is a playwright, beautifully embodied by Anne Consigny as one of those unlucky gifted people hooked into all the pain of the universe. The youngest, Ivan (Melvil), has the glow of someone who has been loved all his life. And the middle child, Henri, played by Mathieu Almaric, is a fast-talking hustler, an alcoholic whose entire personality is a compensation for always having been despised by his parents.  A hint of the filmmaker's perceptiveness comes in an early scene, in which Henri writes an accusatory letter to his sister. Desplechin has Amalric sit in a chair and recite the letter directly into the camera, and gradually, the unexpected message is conveyed: Henri is a jerk. Not only that, but deep down, he is also a jerk. He is absolutely sure, absolutely wrong and a flat-out creep. Yet his relentlessness in the face of rejection and failure has a certain pathetic gallantry. A key role in A Christmas Tale is that of Emmanuelle Devos, as Henri's new girlfriend, who somehow directs the audience's gaze toward what conceivably might be lovable about Henri, that he's funny and that he keeps getting back up.  Like a visit with family, A Christmas Tale does not add up to a single conclusion but rather to a series of subjective impressions, devised on the fly, that might be true and might not. All the characters have revealing moments, including Chiara Mastroianni as the youngest son's wife - she looks like Deneuve, her real-life mother, but she plays an in-law. Desplechin's light hand allows him to achieve these moments of illumination in ways that never feel doled out or arbitrary.  With Desplechin, it doesn't ever feel as though he's straining to show us things. It's more like we're just hanging out. We're in this house, and by some strange coincidence, every time we turn around, something interesting is happening.  -- Advisory: This film contains adult language and disturbing medical procedures.",1
"A Girl Cut in Two (La Fille Coupee en Deux): Drama. Starring Ludivine Sagnier, François Berléand and Benoît Magimel. Directed by Claude Chabrol. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) She's a burst of light. She's youth and freshness, and the men in the movie, who are dead inside, want to get their hands on her and wreck her. Everyone wants a piece of her, even strangers who see her on television. Already a TV weather girl, she's on her way to bigger things, because her essence is unclouded. You look at her and actually see her. A Girl Cut in Two, the latest feature from Claude Chabrol, tells the story of a burgeoning TV personality who is pursued by two men. The men are very different in age and temperament, and yet both are ruthless and despise her vitality even as they're attracted to it. Based on the Harry Thaw-Stanford White scandal of 1906, the film moves the action from turn-of-the-century New York to modern-day France. Along the way, Chabrol soft-pedals the sex-scandal aspect and concentrates instead on the class issues.  Ludivine Sagnier is best known in the United States as the impulsive vixen she played in François Ozon's Swimming Pool, but in France she's known as a versatile actress who works with the best directors and plays all kinds of roles. As Gabrielle, who is at the center of A Girl Cut in Two, she has one of her best showcases. Gabrielle is a trusting kid that people are just drawn to, and as the movie begins, she's young enough to take their interest at face value and not suspect darker motives. Sagnier, a very smart actress, does a number of inspired things in this performance. First of all, she has the personality wattage to make Gabrielle a television natural. When she does the weather - and later when she hosts a talk show - it's easy to see why people would immediately like her. Second, she gives Gabrielle an underlying purity of essence and shows how that purity leaves her open to attack, while also serving as a kind of armor.  The two men who come into Gabrielle's life are Charles, a debauched (but outwardly reserved) novelist, a married man in his 50s; and Paul, a flighty rich kid who, for some reason, has a barely controlled detestation of Charles. That Charles is attracted to Gabrielle is reason enough for Paul to suddenly find her an object of intense fascination. The details of the emotional roller coaster are best discovered during the ride. Suffice it to say that the acting is first-rate and the tone admits lots of opportunities for sardonic humor. This movie would, in fact, be worthy of the highest rating, except for a slight slackening of energy in the last 20 minutes. This slackening doesn't damage the movie, it just keeps the experience a little more earthbound when it might have soared. Along the way, a powerful spectacle unfolds with serious class and feminist implications. A Girl Cut in Two depicts men who hate women and don't even know it, who want to take something special about a woman and transform it into something pedestrian. Just standing there, Gabrielle shows them that there's more to the experience of life than they know, and because they're incapable of ever feeling it, they want to prove that her pure essence isn't real, or at least that it can be destroyed. Only then can they relax and go on being miserable. -- Advisory: Strong language, sexual situations.",1
"A History of Violence: Thriller. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Ed Harris and Maria Bello. Directed by David Cronenberg. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There's not a wasted moment. Yet the pace is measured. Every character gets his due, every environment feels lived in, and every bit of story information comes grounded in detail about character and relationships. Cronenberg presses the movie forward, which in this case is not synonymous with simply advancing the story. Cronenberg is also advancing not an idea so much as an impression of violence as something hovering over virtually all human interaction, like the air people breathe. It's not always there, but it always might be there. It can make itself known at any moment. And, of course, Viggo Mortensen is ready for anything that might happen. Having slain a succession of monsters in the Lord of the Rings sagas, Mortensen finds himself doing some of the same work as Tom, the mild-mannered owner of a diner in small-town Indiana. It's a role that soon reveals itself as playing to Mortensen's strengths -- his humility, his forcefulness and a certain odd unknowable quality. Even before Tom proves himself a capable man when danger lurks, there's something about Mortensen -- or is it something he does as an actor? -- that makes the audience think, No. There has to be more to this guy. Maybe it's the sex scene between Tom and his wife (Maria Bello) that makes us respect him in advance. Early in the film, Tom and his wife have a merry romp in bed that goes to the edge of the R rating. Once again, Bello, who was the girlfriend of William H. Macy in The Cooler, is lucky with her screen lover. As far as guys in movies go, this husband is attentive and enthusiastic. The scene establishes the bond between Mr. and the Mrs. which, like the sex, is not corny. It has some edges to it. Then destiny arrives one night in the form of two murderous drifters, who walk into Tom's diner at closing time, intent on starting trouble. They don't just want to rob the place. Tom makes the calculation (which Mortensen lets us see): They want to kill people. And so Tom does what anybody would do in that situation and ends up a hero, with his story talked up on the national cable news networks. That's all great, until some gangsters in Philadelphia see those news stories and show up the next day in Indiana. They think Tom isn't Tom. They think he's some gangster named Joey, who ran away from Philadelphia 20 years ago. Ed Harris plays the head gangster, a man in a dark suit who rides around in a black Lincoln and who will not be persuaded, not for one second, that Tom isn't Joey. Joey, you're trying so hard to be this other guy, it's really painful to watch, he says. It's bad enough these gangsters think he's Joey, but even worse, they really don't like Joey. And Tom has nowhere to hide. As Hemingway knew when he wrote The Killers, there's something really helpless about a man stuck behind a counter. From this platform, Cronenberg builds the suspense, the sense of everything converging and closing in. Parallels are drawn between Tom's experiences and that of his son (Ashton Holmes), who is contending with bullies in school. The idea is that there's no relief and no shelter, anywhere, which is something Tom seems to understand intuitively. It's what makes him interesting and what makes the movie more than just a routine thriller. He knows violence from the inside out. Mortensen is the main attraction, but this is everybody's show, with Bello passionate and fierce as his wife and Harris exuding an eerie reasonableness as the gangster who can't be dissuaded. Also worth noting is William Hurt, who is flamboyant in a featured role as yet another Philadelphia gangster, who is well dressed and gregarious but, in the best old-movie-gangster tradition, fairly stupid. -- Advisory: This film contains graphic simulated sex, frontal nudity, brutal violence, gore and strong language.

"A generation ago, “Nightcrawler” might have been a satire written by Paddy Chayefsky. But when satire meets reality, there’s no need to exaggerate, and so we get this story of a creepy guy who spends his nights filming scenes of human calamity and selling them to TV news.The title suggests a horror movie. It’s not. It’s just the story of a horrible person, but a fascinating one, with no moral center and no capacity for empathy, but with a crazy kind of tenaciousness and an instinct for self-preservation. As written by Dan Gilroy, who also directed, this character has mastered the peppy, can-do jargon of the modern corporate world and really might be ideally suited for success in our times.The first thing you notice is Jake Gyllenhaal’s face. The movie star alchemy — that special combination of exactly the right weight and exactly the right haircut to produce exactly the right effect — has been thrown out of balance. He looks like a bug-eyed nobody. His face is angular. His hair is slicked back and too long. If he went up Brokeback Mountain looking like this, Heath Ledger never would have liked him. It turns out, Gyllenhaal lost 30 pounds for the role, and in the process, turned himself into a character actor.He starts the movie as another young person dealing with a tough job market, but he’s surviving by stealing fences, wire and manhole covers and selling them to construction foremen. So right away, Gilroy establishes the character. Lou (Gyllenhaal) has no shame and no limits, but he does have the ability to think of things others don’t.Driving on the freeway one night, he stumbles onto an accident scene and watches as a freelance camera crew records the drama — cops pulling a woman from a burning car. This is something he never thought of, and probably something most of the audience never realized: You know that eyewitness footage you see on TV? Not all of it can be done by the station, nor by amateurs passing by. No, there are actual people out there looking for this stuff, listening to their police radios and rushing to every scene that just might have enough blood to make the news. So “Nightcrawler” is the twisted story of a career, of a fellow starting at nothing and, through hard work, trying to make something of himself. What’s bizarre, and yet always the way with movies, is that we’re sufficiently drawn into Lou’s reality that we root for him. We want him to make good. When he blunders into a crime scene ahead of the police, we hope he’ll make it out before they arrive and that no one will confiscate his camera. Gilroy enlists us into the thrill of capturing the rare and the forbidden.Gilroy also shows us the allure of a TV news station, the adrenaline, the allure of artifice, the jacked-up personalities, the excitement of knowing that something is going out live at that precise moment. This is Gilroy’s first film as a director — he has been a screenwriter for years — but already there’s something poetic about his framing. At one point, Gyllenhaal, in close-up, is looking at something; he hears a plane passing overhead and, just for a second, glances up. It’s a peculiar, beautiful moment. We’re aware of Lou as a sensory character, living and reacting. But his reaction is like a lizard or an owl, responding without feeling.Rene Russo (Gilroy’s wife) gets her best role in years, one that capitalizes on her polished surface and completely down-to-earth essence. As the night news director at a struggling station, she recognizes Lou’s talent early and charges him to think of her newscast as like a woman running down the street with her throat cut. That’s the kind of frantic she’s looking for.There are moments that are too macabre and outlandish, but Gilroy steers the movie just this side of farce, just this side of Chayefsky, and keeps it all within a realistic framework. At times watching, you might wonder how he’ll keep the story going, how he’ll top himself. But he does.",1
"A preview of War for the Planet of the Apes.It is a terrible thing when a species realizes that evolution is not on its side. It’s a downright weird thing when a species starts making movies celebrating that possibility. The “X-Men” movies and even to an extent the recent deluge of superhero pictures all deal, to some degree, with the coming obsolescence or helplessness of normal human beings, the implicit idea being that all just should accept this fact and walk in neat, undisturbed lines into the abyss. But no series has been so obvious in its viewpoint as the new “Planet of the Apes” series, a three-movie prequel to the original “Planet of the Apes” (1968), which ended with Charlton Heston screaming on the beach about mankind’s self-destruction. In the new series’ first two films, audiences were asked to root on this inevitability, which was difficult. But in the new film, “War for the Planet of the Apes” — the best of the series, by far — the series’ viewpoint comes into focus, and it’s a lot more intricate and enlightened than some unthinking death wish.Sci-fi has become the domain for mindless action and spectacle, but “War” is something different, a subdued and somber science fiction film, with only small pockets of action. Most of the film consists of quiet conversation, and because most of the apes can communicate only through sign language, many of those conversations are subtitled. Love it or simply like it, “War for the Planet of the Apes” is a conscientious and mostly successful attempt to take science fiction in a thoughtful and intelligent direction. “War” picks up the story at a difficult point for our simian brethren. The humans have scattered the ape forces and are putting the prisoners into zoos, which aren’t really zoos, but massive holding pens for thinking beings. Caesar — the Lincoln/Gandhi of the apes — wants a cease-fire and envisions a world in which humans and apes can live in harmony. But all the momentum seems to be heading toward confrontation.In a movie heavy with special effects — we take those apes for granted, but they are computer generated through a process called performance capture — “War” has at least three strong performances. Andy Serkis as Caesar carries himself as if the fate of the world rested on his choices and seems very much a great man, albeit not a man. Steve Zahn plays a chimpanzee known as Bad Ape, a timid fellow with the gift of speech who is traumatized by things he has seen. It is hard to know where to allocate the praise — either to the actors with the electrodes on their faces or to the technicians who converted their expressions into performances. But the collaboration resulted in something notable and impressive.Woody Harrelson as the human Colonel, whose ambition is to kill every ape in existence and save the Earth for his own species, is the supposed villain of the piece, but the movie grants him his reasons and lots of backstory to play. He has an encounter with Caesar in the middle of the film, a long conversation in which he explains his ideas and his personal history, and Harrelson makes it a fascinating glimpse into a troubled personality. In Harrelson’s insightful rendering, the Colonel has gone off some existential edge, and there’s no reaching him. He is in too much emotional pain to be anything but cruel, because if he stopped being horrible, he’d have no defense against his inner torment.Though things look grim for the apes at the start of the movie, the humans don’t have it all that great themselves. There’s a disease going around that is robbing humans of speech and making them less intelligent, a kind of airborne Alzheimer’s that can hit anybody. Back in 1968, with World War II a recent memory and the Cold War raging, the destruction of humanity was envisioned as self-inflicted, the result of nuclear war. But that original “Planet of the Apes” imagined the apes as rising out of the evolutionary ashes. This new series has always posited something different, and the new fantasy — human stupidity combined with some random cruelty of nature — somehow feels right for our era. That is, an era tormented not so much by paranoia or terror as by a complete and utter philosophical exhaustion.",1
"ABOUT A BOY: Comedy. Starring Hugh Grant, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz and Nicholas Hoult. Directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) About a Boy exploits Grant's edge and much of his considerable charm in its story of a 38-year-old London bachelor who accidentally becomes entangled in the life of a 12-year-old boy. In addition to being a smart comedy and an excellent showcase for Grant, it's an honest movie about childhood that avoids sappiness and sentiment and goes in unexpected directions. Based on the novel by Nick Hornby, the picture was directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz, the duo responsible for the two American Pie movies. But only a fanatical auteurist could find a connection between those films and this one. About a Boy is more reminiscent of the work of screenwriter Peter Hedges, who wrote the novel What's Eating Gilbert Grape and the even better follow-up, An Ocean in Iowa, which was told from the point of view of a little boy. Of course, there are two boys in About a Boy, and one of them is Will, the overgrown one played by Grant. He doesn't need to work, so he doesn't. He lives off the royalties from a Christmas song his father wrote in 1958 and spends his days buying CDs and watching television. He has no interest in marriage or children but spends much of his time thinking of the best ways to meet women. Grant is always funny in scenes in which he has to lie, and About a Boy provides some good ones. In one scene, Will is about to break up with a woman, who saves him the trouble by abruptly dumping him. He suppresses his delight and pretends, awkwardly, to be sorry. Later, he devises a scheme to meet single mothers by going to a support group and gets carried away with emotion while describing his fictitious son, Ned. About a Boy has lots of plot and a big cast of characters who are interrelated in complicated ways, but Hedges' screenplay is so economical and the Weitzes' direction so graceful that we barely register this as we're watching. It just unfolds, like life. A troubled 12-year-old boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), attaches himself to Will, and suddenly Will finds himself involved with the boy and the boy's hippie-ish, suicidal mother (Toni Collette). As soon as the kid emerges as a major character, there is a tendency to think this is one of those movies where our hero is supposed to realize something noble, probably about the joys of commitment and the triviality of his existence. But the picture doesn't fall into a predictable groove. Throughout, sentiment, earned and not forced, is balanced by caustic humor. The kid is not a cliche or a symbol, but a specific individual, a boy whose neurotic, helpless mother has caused him to become both self-reliant and slightly weird. We get the whole picture -- the tender but suffocating quality of the mother's affection, the airless atmosphere of their cluttered apartment, the outcast status at school. Nicholas Hoult plays the boy without special pleading, with the matter-of-fact approach of a kid born into a situation and coping with it. That's how the movie approaches him, not as an object of pity, but as just another kid with another set of problems. It's the right approach. Likewise, Will is not the usual swinging bachelor found in movies. He has money, but his apartment still looks seedy. He spends a lot of time unshaven in front of the television, and his face is getting a little mature for his bad-boy act. There's a blankness there. Collette as the mother is appropriately frustrating as a hard-to-reach eccentric, and Rachel Weisz is vivid in what is essentially a bit part. But the movie is really about the two boys -- the big one and the little one and about how each has something the other one needs. . Advisory: This film contains some strong language. ",1
"AIRHEADS: Comedy. Starring Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi and Adam Sandler. Directed by Michael Lehmann. (PG-13. 100 minutes.) At times it's like a youth-rebellion fantasy, with teenagers taking to the streets in support of the film's heroes -- three would-be  rock stars who inadvertently take a radio station hostage to get their demo played. Airheads celebrates the purity and completeness of rock-and-roll fanaticism, implying that it can be a healing thing, or at least a great way of embracing life. Airheads'  script, by Rich Wilkes, is informed by a real understanding of heavy metal in all its silliness -- the lingo, the look, the stage set-ups, the ridiculous lyrics, the cliched guitar licks. It also understands that the people behind heavy metal can be really charming and as passionately committed to their notion of good music as other artists. Since directing Heathers in 1989, director Michael Lehmann has piloted two stiffs -- Hudson Hawk and Meet the Applegates. But now he's back in the teenage milieu and doing fine. He finds the right tone for Airheads. The actors play it straight, without commenting on or mocking their characters. Brendan Fraser is superb as Chazz, the leader of the Lone Rangers. The other band members, the hostile, somewhat long- in-the-tooth rocker Rex (Steve Buscemi) and dim-witted Pip (Adam Sandler of Saturday Night Live), are more strictly comic characters. ",1
"AMELIE: Romance. Starring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. (R. 120 minutes. At the Clay.) Anyone who loves movies, anyone who is interested in how they're put together, and anyone who craves seeing something new and special should see this movie. Amelie is a safe bet, rich in humor, invention and beautiful compositions, with camera shots that are flashy but grounded in emotion and a wonderful leading lady who is 90 percent lovely and 10 percent freak. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (The City of Lost Children, Delicatessen) has come close to making a great movie, which is closer than most directors ever come. Where his film misses the mark is not in its execution but its inspiration. Something is missing -- some initial need to say something, some depth of emotion, some extra idea. By the time one gets to the end of Amelie,  one gets the sense of having watched a brilliantly made movie that's warm but not warm enough, honest but not quite rigorous enough to glow from within. Still, it glows from without. Everything is striking, including Audrey Tautou as Amelie. With her large black eyes, pale skin and placid expression, she looks and moves like some gentle extraterrestrial -- one with an extra sense. Perhaps the sense tells her that life is a big movie. (Why else would she keep looking directly into the camera to smile at us?) Amelie is the ideal surrogate for the director, the embodiment of Jeunet's compassion and vague disconnection. Amelie is 23-year-old woman who works in cafe in Paris. One day she discovers a tin box that a boy hid in a secret place in her apartment some 40 years before. She finds the owner of the tin box, and the effect on the now middle-aged owner is so rich and transformative that she makes it her mission to do good deeds for people. Amelie discovers the box on the night she finds out that Princess Diana has been killed. There's no connection between the events, just an acknowledgment of the weird simultaneity of life. Amelie is at its best in conveying a mystical sense of life going by, of a universe of individual poignant moments rising up and receding. It's a sense that cinema, with its unlimited visual palette, is uniquely suited to conveying, and Jeunet is sincere in his attempt to convey it. There's only one way for a director to find just the right angle, for example, to film a cat listening to a bedtime story, or a goldfish looking meaningfully at its owner: It's to feel it. Amelie's benevolent interventions into people's lives are always interesting, and when she turns to taking revenge on a nasty grocer, the movie becomes very funny. (She sneaks into his apartment and gently disarranges things.) Too bad Amelie doesn't find its main story in its heroine's efforts to help people. Instead it goes in a romantic direction and becomes self- conscious. Amelie sets her sights on a young fellow who works in pornography store and spends his free time piecing together discarded photos. It's all too fey. It also takes far too long. Amelie creates a lot of audience goodwill with its glorious beginning, but it tests that goodwill in its last half hour. ",1
"ANGEL EYES: Romantic drama. Starring Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Luis Mandoki. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. Credit director Luis Mandoki, or maturity, or confidence, or an actress' finding the right role. Whatever the reasons, Lopez, who was always competent onscreen, is now an actress who can do things other movie stars can't do. She doesn't push, just thinks, and her thoughts and emotions burn into the film. As for the movie itself, it's sneaky in the best way, though some viewers will be annoyed. It's not a thriller, even though the title sounds like something about a serial killer. It's not a crime picture, even though Lopez plays a Chicago policewoman. Angel Eyes is a romantic drama. In fact, it's next door to an art film. Audiences may be thrown by it. Romantic movies are usually comedies. If not, they're thrillers, in which lovers meet, fall in love and kill a homicidal maniac. In Angel Eyes, it's just two people, one weird, one Lopez, who find each other. The weird one is Catch, played by Jim Caviezel. Catch is tall and thin and floats around Chicago -- or what is supposed to pass for Chicago -- needing a shave and looking at the world through the blue eyes of a Technicolor Jesus. He lives in an apartment that's virtually empty and behaves as though his head is in some other world. Caviezel, seeming like a cross between Henry Fonda and Norman Bates, maintains an aura of mystery without seeming too coy or austere. Lopez, who looks comfortable in a police officer's uniform, plays Sharon, a woman who's fearless but has a lot of pain underneath the surface. Poor Sharon has one of those families that people have a way of having -- a father who used to beat up Mom, a brother who now beats his wife. But here's the realistic touch: They're all mad at her. True to the adage that no good deed goes unpunished, they are outraged -- even worse, deeply hurt and confused by her cruelty -- because years before Sharon called the cops on Dad when he was pummeling Mom. Angel Eyes is the rare film that presents a family dynamic as demented as ones we know from life. Movies usually would have us believe that if people would only talk, etc. Here, the family members are too twisted and too invested in their self-delusion for conversation to matter. Sharon knows it's not her fault that she's the only human in a family of cretins, but she feels as if it is, and it's lonely. So she could use a love life. Early in the movie she meets Catch, under extreme circumstances, which may or may not have been divinely ordained. She likes him, even though he doesn't have a job and refuses to talk about his life. You ever hear of starting from scratch? he says. This is scratch. The rest of the movie is about the ups and downs of this peculiar courtship, with next to no action to spice things up. Some viewers will be pulling out their hair. Discerning viewers will get into the rhythm. Angel Eyes is a rare thing -- a well-acted character study of a hardworking woman, by a screenwriter (Gerald DiPego) and a director with enough integrity to dispense with the usual Hollywood distractions.

"ARARAT: Drama. Starring Arsinee Khanjian, David Alpay and Charles Aznavour. Directed by Atom Egoyan. (R. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is a heartfelt piece, and while passion alone can't carry a movie, it sure helps. Ararat is uneven because Egoyan couldn't tell it smoothly. Instead he infuses his movie with an intensity of feeling that makes us willing to take the ride with him, over some bumps. A Canadian filmmaker of Armenian origin, Egoyan is best known for The Sweet Hereafter, a more pristine work, but a little on the tepid and studied side. I much prefer Ararat, which has the obsessiveness and audacity of a film that had to be made or its filmmaker would have combusted. The picture, which takes its name from a mountain in Turkey, is set in modern times. An Armenian director named Saroyan (Charles Aznavour), with the help of a screenwriter (Eric Bogosian), is making a movie about the genocide and approaches an art scholar, Ani (Arsinee Khanjian), an expert on the Turkish Armenian painter Arshile Gorky, whom the filmmakers have decided to work into their story. Ararat gets a period feel by adding flashbacks of Gorky in his studio, and by showing movie-within-the-movie scenes of Saroyan's re-creation of the Armenian slaughter. Egoyan uses the movie-within-the-movie scenes in two ways. We get a glimpse of the horror, just enough to feel it. But at the same time we can't help but noticing something low-rent about Saroyan's movie. Egoyan is telling us that there are some things beyond the reach of cinema. Even the greatest movie is still just a movie. To be sure, Egoyan may also be compensating for his own uncertainty and lack of expertise in staging epic battle scenes in period costume, but no matter. The holocaust in World War II was a lot worse than Schindler's List, and the Armenian genocide was a lot worse than anything Egoyan might have staged here. In a movie-saturated age, it's a point worth emphasizing. Egoyan also lets us into the turmoil within Ani's family. As Ani, Khanjian, darkly beautiful and glowing with intelligence, plays a woman who has to cope with a grown son (David Alpay), who is in a turbulent love affair with her stepdaughter (played by the fiery Marie-Josee Crozee). The stepdaughter insists that Ani drove her father, Ani's former husband, to suicide, while Ani insists that her own version of the story -- that it was an accident -- is correct. Anyone with a pen, paper and some time to kill can do the mental gymnastics required to figure out the connection between the genocide and Ani and her step-daughter's dispute over family history. More important is the way Egoyan manages to make the fact of the genocide hang like a poisonous cloud over every scene, informing relationships. It's the denied truth that won't be ignored. Christopher Plummer plays a custom's officer, who detains Ani's son at the Canadian border when he returns from a visit to Turkey. The young man tells the custom's officer -- and us, too -- all about the history that inspired the movie. It's an obvious device, but the information is welcome. ",1
"AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER: Comedy. Starring Mike Myers, Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles. Directed by Jay Roach. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The novelty of the series may be lost. Austin himself is not as comic a character as he once was -- maybe that's inevitable. But familiarity brings other pleasures, not the least of which is the sense of a shared experience. With Goldmember, the Austin Powers series enters that coveted land once inhabited by Peter Sellers' Pink Panther movies. Audiences bring with them an affection for the characters and a happy anticipation of a certain kind of joke. And Goldmember delivers. True, much of what it delivers is gross and idiotic. There are more poo-poo and penis jokes here than you can shake a stick at. But series creator Mike Myers, who plays Austin, combines his toilet-humor sensibility with a highly developed comic inventiveness. He's not just good -- he's better than he was, and he's growing. In one scene, Austin and Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer) are behind a screen, innocently casting a shadow that suggests all kinds of lewd and bizarre things that aren't really happening. To describe the scene does it no justice, but it's brilliant enough to be in a Buster Keaton movie. Myers' visual jokes are his most creative. He has a bit in which he and his beautiful new co-star Beyonce Knowles are in the office of a Japanese businessman. The businessman asks them, in Japanese, if they'd like to eat shiitake mushrooms, but because the white subtitle is obscured by something white in the background, his guests believe that he has offered them something else entirely. It's only by moving something dark into the background that Austin is able to read the subtitle and understand what's really on the plate. The new movie pits Austin against a new villain, Goldmember (also played by Myers), a Dutch megalomaniac whose fixation with gold brought about a gruesome smelting accident involving his genitalia. Hence the name. Like Fat Bastard, who also makes an appearance here, Goldmember has hideous personal habits -- notably a predilection for peeling his sunburned skin and eating it. At the start of the movie, Goldmember has escaped in a time machine to the year 1975, where he is hatching a plot to melt the polar ice cap. Austin follows him and, in a disco, hooks up with ex-flame Foxxy Cleopatra (Knowles), who wears her hair in an afro and likes to snap her fingers when she talks. She is a parody of the kind of women Pam Grier used to play in '70s blaxploitation movies. Knowles, of the pop group Destiny's Child, sings the title song, a melody that sounds cobbled together from three K.C. and the Sunshine Band tunes. (Either somebody is getting a percentage or somebody's lawyer is getting a phone call today.) Michael Caine plays Sir Nigel, Austin's debonair and neglectful dad. It's ideal casting: a legendary hipster from Britain's swinging '60s playing the father of a British '60s hipster. The story is complicated but as disposable as it should be, serving only as an excuse to bring on all the characters audiences want to see. Austin's hairless arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers), gets as much screen time as Austin. His first scene exemplifies much of what is different about the series. Dr. Evil dotes on his midget look-alike Mini-Me at the expense of his son, Scott Evil (Seth Green), in a scene that goes on and on, flogging the same joke through lots of dead air until Myers' approach begins to seem practically avant-garde. Anyone who takes chances like this is bound to fail some of the time. Not all the jokes in Goldmember hit the mark. Likewise, the movie's attempt to inject a note of pathos in Austin's longing for his father's approval feels awkward. It seems a mistake ever to place Austin in the role of straight man. Still, there are enough laughs here that entire lines of dialogue are missed, and that says something. Goldmember is probably destined to be remembered as this summer's comic gem. This film contains sexual situations and lewd humor. ",1
"Action movies usually present powerful good people going up against even more powerful bad people, in an unequal struggle in which good ultimately wins. That’s the formula. But a few years ago, the makers of “Taken” got the idea to combine that form with a rags-to-riches structure. In the case of “Taken,” this translated into the story of a gentle, humble father, who is redeemed in the eyes of his daughter by springing into action and killing about 100 people.This structure has the built-in appeal of being emotionally satisfying — and yet funny. In the “Taken” movies, it’s just wonderfully ridiculous watching nice, easygoing Liam Neeson turn into a homicidal maniac. And now, there’s “The Foreigner” offering the same kind of absurd satisfaction, with Jackie Chan as a sweet little guy, an older fellow that no one takes seriously, who becomes a killing machine. It’s the first of Chan’s movies to match the quality of his early work in Hong Kong. It makes use of his martial arts expertise and physical gracefulness, as well as the fact that he’s now in his early 60s. The movie also allows Chan to demonstrate that he can act. In between setting traps, blowing things up and rendering people unconscious, Chan plays grief in “The Foreigner,” and his face contains all the sadness of the world.He loses his daughter in the movie’s first scene. Quan (Chan) drops her off at a store in London, and a terrorist bomb goes off seconds later, killing her and several others. It turns out that the bombing is the work of an Irish Republican Army splinter group that no one has ever heard of. Pierce Brosnan, as a former IRA member now working in the British government, is put in charge of finding the people responsible.Quan wants to find them, too, and he gets the idea into his head that Hennessy (that is, Brosnan) can tell him how. Quan is quiet, grief-stricken and poorly dressed. He’s small, polite and has a thick accent. He looks like the farthest thing from a threat when he starts hanging around Hennessy’s office asking for the names of his daughter’s murderers. And then we realize that this meek, modest older gentleman, who seems like the most harmless man in the world, has some moves. Yes, he has those Jackie Chan moves, and he is about to use every one of them.The first time Chan starts flipping people and throwing them through windows, the impulse is to laugh out loud. But at the same time, that moment, as well as every subsequent one like it, has the visceral satisfaction of watching the underdog get in some shots. And that’s basically the appeal of “The Foreigner,” which is something like the appeal of “Taken” — a combination of laughing at it, while being totally swept along by it.Unlike “Taken,” which has a simple story, “The Foreigner” has an intricate and well-developed plot involving many characters inside the government, the IRA and law enforcement. Most of those threads have more to do with Hennessy than Quan, which means that Brosnan has the most screen time. And he’s terrific, trying to juggle a dozen threats, any one of which might ruin him, all while dealing with a crazy little guy who won’t stop coming after him. Half the satisfaction of “The Foreigner” is in the spectacle of this handsome, unflappable patrician having his natural composure annihilated. Given the story, it’s hard to imagine how anyone might come up with a sequel to “The Foreigner,” but the same could have been said for “Taken.” In any case, someone has finally figured out what to do with Jackie Chan in America. This formula is the right one. ",1
"Action. Starring Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace. Directed by Olivier Megaton. (PG-13. 91 minutes.) In Taken 2, poor Liam Neeson doesn't ask for much out of life, just a chance to worry over his teenage daughter, like an old fusspot, and maybe get back with his ex-wife. He wants to talk about basketball with his buddies and put his violent past as a lethal CIA operative behind him. But the bad guys won't leave him be. They keep showing up and forcing him to kill them. Taken 2 is the sequel to Taken, the utterly irresistible 2009 thriller that introduced Neeson as an action star in the Harrison Ford vein, that of the fellow who's seemingly normal and reasonable - just don't get him mad. In the original, Albanian slave traffickers abducted his daughter (big mistake). In the sequel, the Albanians are grieving over their dead - lots and lots of dead - and decide that it's payback time.  Indeed, they decide to take their revenge about two lines into the screenplay, which is just the first example of why Taken 2 is like a textbook on how to make beautiful, successful and highly satisfying junk-food cinema. When it's just a plot point, the information gets tossed out as fast and as forcefully as possible. Time is lavished only on the things that matter. And in Taken 2 the things that matter have all to do with character. If you see the movie, this is something worth noticing: As much as this picture is action driven - virtually conceived as a series of interlocking, escalating sequences - its greatest delights are grounded in personality, in the fun of having a protagonist who combines homespun values with velociraptor functionality. The movie commits to the character of Bryan Mills just as Neeson does, unflinchingly, with no compromise, irony or winking at the audience. To give one example of how effective this can be, take the scene in which Neeson, chained up down in some hellish basement by the traffickers, sneaks out a call to his teenage daughter. He instructs her to go into his suitcase, take out two hand grenades and a gun, and go to the roof to await a second phone call. For good measure, he instructs her to Be casual.  This moment is grandly pleasing in a number of ways: (1) In its sheer audacity as a plot turn; (2) In its insane and yet complete believability in terms of the Mills character - both in that he'd give his daughter these instructions and that he'd happen to have hand grenades in his suitcase; and (3) In the way it makes us anticipate more. What does he want her to do with those hand grenades, anyway? It all starts as just a little vacation in Istanbul, which looks stunning. Mills is pleased, because his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) seems to be coming back around to him, and their daughter (Maggie Grace) is there, too. They're family again, and all is well, until he notices that their car is being followed. Never one unwilling to deny reality, he snaps into survival mode - and he stays there, angry and focused, as well as irritated that these people keep forcing him to extremes. Taken 2 is not about subtlety. At one point a fatherly looking man (Rade Serbedzija) tells Mills that he plans to sell Mills' daughter back into slavery and that she will be abused by so many men that she'll be nothing more than a piece of meat a dog would not have. OK, so that's the bad guy. Got it. Fortunately, a good action film doesn't need subtlety but clean lines, sure definitions, big emotions and, ideally, economy. Taken 2 has all these things. It also has the most genuinely nerve-racking car chase I've seen in years. Yes, for the record Taken was fresher, and therefore better, but not by a lot. As sequels go, Taken 2 is more than respectable, and so enjoyable I'd happily sit down right now and watch Taken 3, if it existed. Someday it probably will.",1
"Action. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson. Directed by Justin Lin. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Ten years and a number of entries later, Fast Five is the first sequel to the 2001 The Fast and the Furious that's worth watching, that isn't an embarrassment or a travesty of the original picture. Director Justin Lin, who directed two previous sequels, is still not the director that Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious) is, and he still doesn't know quite what to do with Vin Diesel. This is an action star of mythic dimension, an actor who can take an audience anywhere, and half the time Lin lets him look like just another nice, middle-aged bald guy.  But at least, this time Lin tries things. He has discovered, for example, that it's always smart to give Diesel the last word in every scene, to shoot him in close-up with lots of sound-track support, even if his line is something like We need to get some fresh air. No matter. With Diesel growling and insinuating the words in his bass voice, anything he says will seem important. Lin has also found the tone that eluded him in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast & Furious. He has finally made the transition from stupid to gloriously stupid, which is all-important in action movies. Stupid is when a movie offers something ridiculous but takes it seriously - and expects you to take it seriously. Gloriously Stupid is when a movie offers you something ridiculous and knows it's ridiculous - but then promises to go way beyond ridiculous and surprise you with how insane and grandly ridiculous a movie can be while keeping a straight face. Fast Five does exactly that.  The gloriousness begins two minutes in. Dominic (Vin Diesel), a street racer of genius, is sentenced to 25 years in federal prison - but no, don't be sad, because he'll never get there. His sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), and his buddy Brian devise a subtle scheme for taking over the prison bus - by forcing it to skid off the road and flip over a half-dozen times at high speed. Why didn't they just blow it up? Then just a few minutes later, they're all in Brazil, robbing race cars from a moving train, in a sequence that's laughable until you find yourself leaning forward in your seat with your jaw in your lap. Beautiful action choreography for that one. In Fast Five, Dominic, Mia and Brian are outlaws. They can't go home and they can't earn a legitimate living in Brazil, so they have no economic option but crime. Meanwhile, an FBI agent is on the trail, not some regular FBI agent, but the best there is - the toughest, the meanest, the most relentless and driven, who is even bigger, badder and balder than Diesel: Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. the Rock. But if Dominic, Mia and Brian are to be criminals, they have to be virtuous ones, and so Chris Morgan, in his screenplay, comes up with one good idea: They decide to rob a very bad guy, the most corrupt man in Brazil, who exploits the poor and has the police in his pocket. Dominic's idea is to do one big score and then go off somewhere to relax. (After all, there's nothing more relaxing than looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life, knowing you've ripped off a mobster.) So they put together the ultimate team to pull off the heist of the century. Fast Five is not a movie for morons - it's not even a movie about morons, though at times one wonders. (At one point, the gang steals six police cars, and instead of getting them garaged as quickly as possible, they race them through the streets of Rio.) Rather it's a movie for audiences who think exuberance in movies is more important than sense or logic and who can laugh at a movie and like it at the same time.  -- Advisory: Violence.",1

The Southern home front doesn't find patriots banding together in common cause but individuals falling victim to marauding home raiders -- Southern thugs who steal property and murder deserting soldiers. And the Northern soldiers don't get a pass, either. They're thieves and rapists. As depicted in Cold Mountain, director Anthony Minghella's rendering of the Charles Frazier novel, the South before the collapse of the Confederacy is a world upended, where life is cheap and miserable, and where a Southern belle doesn't worry about making ball gowns out of curtains but about surviving the winter. If she's in love, like Ada -- played by Nicole Kidman -- she also worries about whether she'll ever see her sweetheart again. In Ada's case, she worries for years, without any word from the front lines. Cold Mountain begins with a battle scene so masterfully conceived and shot that somewhere in the ether D.W. Griffith may be taking off his hat. The scene is a succession of brutalities: In 1864, at Petersburg, Va., the Union troops tunnel under enemy lines and dynamite the Confederates in their trenches. This is followed by a Union charge, which turns into a disaster. The charging troops find themselves in a massive ditch, exposed to Confederate fire. In the melee, Inman (Jude Law) is wounded, and he's subsequently sent to a makeshift army hospital. This gives the art director and set decorator a chance to show that they've faithfully studied Civil War field-hospital daguerreotypes. Knowing that the Southern cause is lost, Inman decides to desert before he's quite recovered. The rest of the film alternates between showing Ada's struggles at home and Inman's odyssey, mainly on foot, back to Ada and Cold Mountain, N.C. Kidman grows into the role. In the flashback scenes to Ada and Inman's very brief courtship, she seems too mature, if not in appearance, certainly in essence. But as adversity forces Ada to come into her strength and womanliness, Kidman gets a handle on Ada and blossoms along with her. The role's defining note is longing -- for peace, for a better life, but specifically for Inman and everything that reunion might imply -- and that makes it ideal for Kidman, who, despite her ethereal looks, is an especially earthy actress. Her longing, his longing. The movie never relinquishes that thread, because it guides the action and offers the only promise of a future. The sex drive is the life force, the one block on the impulse toward destruction. There's a moving episode in which Inman is helped by a young widow (a grown-up Natalie Portman), who's nursing a sick infant. She puts him up for the night and ultimately asks him to sleep in her bed, just to be able to touch someone again. Grief and sadness are released just by touching hands. That moment has more impact than the sex scenes of 20 other movies. Not all the stations in Inman's episodic journey land with nearly such force, though Law remains every inch the collective dream of a Confederate soldier: young, stoic and feline, with something dark and awful behind the eyes. Back on Cold Mountain, meanwhile, the home front is enlivened by the arrival of Renee Zellweger as Ruby, a rough tomboy who can do any kind of farm work. Zellweger's performance is broad and fun and daringly idiosyncratic, but never untrue or out of control. We experience Ruby the way we might, in real life, experience someone like Ruby. First as a character, then as a person. At 154 minutes, Cold Mountain is long and seems long, at times inspired, at times merely dutiful. But in most of the important ways, it succeeds. It's impossible to watch the film without hating the home raiders, for example, or caring whether Inman makes it home. More enduringly, Cold Mountain changes our image of the collapsing Confederacy in the same way that Saving Private Ryan changed our collective notion of D-Day. You just know it had to be this bad and that, if anything, it was worse. -- Advisory: This film contains strong battle violence, murders and sexual situations. ",1
"Actress/writer Zoe Kazan as Ruby and actor Paul Dano as Calvin star in the film.Actress/writer Zoe Kazan as Ruby and actor Paul Dano as Calvin star in the film.Annette Bening as ÒGertrudeÓ and Antonio Banderas as ÒMortÓ on the set of RUBY SPARKS.Annette Bening as ÒGertrudeÓ and Antonio Banderas as ÒMortÓ on the set of RUBY SPARKS.Paul Dano as ÒCalvinÓ on the set of RUBY SPARKS.Paul Dano as ÒCalvinÓ on the set of RUBY SPARKS.It's one thing to introduce an original and interesting idea, but it's quite another to take that idea and expand it, to tap its hidden meanings and turn it into something that's more than a gimmick - a satisfying full-length movie. That's what we get with Ruby Sparks.Paul Dano plays a young novelist who was once a boy wonder - he wrote a great work when he was still in his teens, and now it's 10 years later, and he still hasn't delivered his second novel. It's a real advantage of Ruby Sparks - and a credit to Dano's performance and to the direction of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) - that from the first moments it's easy to accept Dano in the role of a major literary talent. The audience must believe in the power of his mind.The life of a struggling genius is presented as lonely, lots of writing and tearing things up, and showing up at book signings where the groupies are just not as exciting as those at rock concerts. One day the author starts imagining his own ideal companion, and when he starts writing about her, the pages come easily. And then just as her whole history is filled in, he comes home to find her in his kitchen. Ruby (Zoe Kazan) has come to life as his live-in lover.So far, so good. The author, without even trying, has willed this woman into existence. But what makes the movie succeed are the things that happen next. The terms of Ruby's existence are made clear, and they're the right choices, in terms of audience interest: Ruby is not an imaginary figure. Other people can see her, because she's actually there. And although the author can make her do anything by simply writing about it, she has complete autonomy for as long as he leaves her alone.As such, Ruby Sparks becomes the story of what happens when a man meets his fantasy. Would his fantasy like him? It's also a story of power dynamics within a relationship. If you had the ability to control your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend, would you use it, and how often? And if you did, where would that lead? And so a movie about the power of the imagination really becomes a movie about a certain element of surrender - about the release of power - that is practically a requirement for loving somebody.Dano is ideally suited to playing the introspective author, floating through life in a zone between his own imagination and daily reality, and between his desires for peace and for connection. Zoe Kazan, who plays Ruby, might not be everybody's dream girl, but she is perfectly right for him - cute, smart and sensitive, the fantasy of a man who is genuinely on to himself and his own needs. It's nice that Kazan worked out so well in the role, in that she also wrote the screenplay.  ",1
"Adam Brody as Harry Reems, and Amanda Seyfried as Linda Lovelace, in LOVELACEAdam Brody as Harry Reems, and Amanda Seyfried as Linda Lovelace, in LOVELACE Drama. Starring Amanda Seyfried, Peter Sarsgaard and Chris Noth. Directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman. (R. 97 minutes.) In her years of notoriety, the porn star Linda Lovelace had a fevered, glazed neediness about her, a quality that makes it easy to avoid ever seeing (or ever wanting to see) Deep Throat. In her later years, as an antipornography spokeswoman, this neediness transformed into the covered, professional aura of someone who'd come to terms with her life, who had worked to find her inner value. From working-class origins, Lovelace also seemed like someone who'd had to learn the hard way how to navigate in the big world. Amanda Seyfried, who portrays her in Rob Epstein and Jeff Friedman's compelling new film, Lovelace, has a whole other atmosphere. She seems like someone from a relatively comfortable background, someone who has been loved all her life, so when called upon to play an unloved person, she can't really go to that place. She can only imagine how awful she might feel, as a loved person, to be suddenly unloved, which is something else entirely. She plays Lovelace as sad, like someone who knows what she's missing, rather than as someone who is utterly lost and doesn't even know it.  But if Seyfried's Lovelace isn't quite the real Lovelace, she is nonetheless a sympathetic and fascinating locus for the film, which tells a miserable, dispiriting story, but does it so well that the experience is galvanizing, not depressing. Perhaps what makes it galvanizing is that this woman - as abused and publicly humiliated as any public figure of the last 50 years - is finally getting her say, albeit (and so typical of her luck) from beyond the grave. She died after a car wreck in 2002.The whole story, in just five words: Linda met the wrong guy. Oh, did she ever. As a teenager in Florida, she makes the acquaintance of Chuck Traynor (Peter Sarsgaard), who runs a topless bar, where the girls turn tricks on the side. Traynor charms her and provides her with the opportunity to escape her loving but remote father and her harsh, cold mother (played to perfection by Sharon Stone). Linda marries Traynor - and if she never made another mistake for the rest of her life, that would have been enough to push her straight into a ditch. As played by Sarsgaard, Traynor is a sporadically engaging, psychologically tortured sadist. If you go on YouTube and see the real Traynor in documentary footage, he seems more like a garden-variety thug, but no matter. Sarsgaard's Traynor matches Seyfried's Linda, and, in any case, is more interesting than a flat-out brute - he's brutish enough as it is. According to Lovelace, it was Traynor who taught Linda how to perform the act for which she was to become famous, and it was Traynor who discovered that his wife had no gag reflex. In the world of porn, that's the equivalent of being able to hit an E-flat over high C. The screenplay adopts an unusual strategy. First it tells Linda's story, and it's bad enough. Then it goes back and tells the same story, this time filling in the blanks, and it's indescribably worse. Even then, the movie skirts over Linda's decision to get into porn, probably because it's hard to imagine Seyfried's Linda being so lost (or so terrorized) that she'd agree to it. The 8mm peep-show films that she and Traynor made before Deep Throat aren't mentioned. Lovelace is based on Linda's autobiography, Ordeal - you know life hasn't been easy when Ordeal is the name of your autobiography - which she wrote under her real name, Linda Boreman. In it, she describes incidents of such awfulness that her publisher insisted she take a polygraph test before they agreed to publish it. She passed the test. The filmmakers follow Linda's account and are entirely in Linda's corner, perhaps more than she actually deserved, although deserve is a funny word in this context. Even if a quarter of what Boreman claimed was true, she had a lot more coming to her than a sympathetic hearing and much prettier actress playing her onscreen. She practically deserved an apology from the male sex, and that, in a way, is what this movie is.  The early 1970s styles are faithfully rendered, and so are the attitudes, and they don't make you want to go back in time, which is fitting in this case. Two small quibbles: Elvin Bishop's Fooled Around and Fell in Love is from 1975 and doesn't belong on the soundtrack. And James Franco is 10 years too young and not nearly awkward enough to play Hugh Hefner, circa 1971. The whole fun of Hefner was that men could look at him and think, I'm cooler than that guy. But no idea or inspiration could make someone look like Franco, only good luck. ",1
"Adventure. Starring Drew Barrymore, John Krasinski, Ted Danson and Tim Blake Nelson. Directed by Ken Kwapis. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are stories that by their very nature force you to confront the possibility that people aren't entirely horrible. Case in point: In 1988, three whales got themselves trapped in Alaska. They were 5 miles away from the ocean, breathing through a small opening in the ice, but within days, everyone knew, that opening would freeze over and the whales would drown ... unless a lot of people got together and did something about it - immediately. The story of that incident is recounted in Big Miracle, a title that doesn't exactly leave much room for suspense. It is the real-life (though Hollywoodized) account of how environmentalists, politicians, soldiers, foreign governments, Alaskan tribesmen and the news media teamed up to save the whales, but that's not the part that speaks well of humanity. The encouraging - and curious - part of the story is that people were genuinely interested, all over the world. It's a nice thought that when given the facts and no personal interest in thinking otherwise, people will instinctively take the side of life over death.  Big Miracle is about how the rescue attempt was brought about by a confluence of various interests. John Krasinski plays a TV reporter, mired in the frozen backwater of Alaska, who sees the story as his ticket to the lower 48. Ted Danson is a drill-happy oilman who recognizes the publicity advantage of getting out in front of the rescue effort. Various elements in the Reagan administration see this as an opportunity to bolster a fairly weak environmental record, and the local Eskimos figure out that if they choose to eat the whales, rather than help them, they will be perceived as bloody savages. Only Drew Barrymore, as a Greenpeace honcho, is in it entirely for the whales, but then that's good that there's only one selfless person around. Instead of this being a story of a bunch of lovely people doing a lovely thing, it's rather the story of average people who become much better people as a result of doing a lovely thing, even though some start out doing it for less than noble reasons. Watching the film, I had no recollection of the 1988 news story, though I had a pretty good idea how things would turn out, mainly because they didn't call the movie Three Dead Whales, despite that title's obvious box office appeal. In the absence of suspense, the filmmakers' challenge was holding the audience, despite the atmosphere of inevitability. They set out to do this in two ways - first by following the various and fascinating trails of self-interest, as they miraculously converge. (If anything, that was the  true big miracle, that everyone knew they'd benefit.) And second, by sticking to the story itself, which was full of crises and turning points.  The strong emotions at play are good, but the movie veers, at times, into schmaltz, and some comedy shorthand feels lazy and dumb - as when two brothers from Minnesota, who invented an ice melting machine, are treated like a pair of comic bumpkins out of Fargo. Director Ken Kwapis skates too much on the surface, making obvious choices, but he is rescued in this tendency by Barrymore, Dermot Mulroney (as a National Guard colonel), Tim Blake Nelson (as a wild life expert) and even Krasinski, all of whom have a real instinct for the truth. Big Miracle is not the most sophisticated adventure film, but compared with most family movies, it's practically something out of Noel Coward. ",1
"Agents Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) return to protect the universe from alien forces in the good-natured Men in Black II. Photo by Melinda Sue GordonAgents Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) return to protect the universe from alien forces in the good-natured Men in Black II. Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon : MEN IN BLACK II: Science fiction comedy. Starring Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The new movie does something rare that all sequels should do. It takes everything good about the original and amplifies it, and everything bad about the original and eliminates it. Gone are the disgusting aliens spewing blue goo. Gone is the revolting insect man. In fact, gone are all the creepy touches that made the original seem as if it was made for 12-year-old boys. Maybe the idea is that this time out, after five long years, the target audience has grown into adolescence. Accordingly, the villain is no longer Vincent D'Onofrio in ugly make-up but the much-easier-to-look-at Lara Flynn Boyle as the leather-clad space queen Serleena. Men in Black II retains the earlier film's ability to delight the viewer with surprise effects and flights of fancy, only now the effects are better. A chase through Manhattan streets in flying cars looks as if it's really happening -- and what a great way to see the city. Every other minute the audience is presented with something magical and goofy: A railway locker opens and inside we find an entire civilization of tiny, and very pious, aliens. Most importantly, Men in Black II finds ways to play on the relationship between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as special agents Kay and Jay. They are the Men in Black, whose job is to regulate the alien presence on Earth and protect the world from hostile elements in the universe. The story left off last time with Kay (Jones) retiring and having his memory wiped out, so at the start, Jay (Smith) is on his own to face the threat presented by Serleena. She is looking for the light of Zartha, but the details don't matter -- the movie doesn't even pretend they matter. All that matters is that Jay has until midnight to save the world from annihilation. To succeed, he needs to bring back Kay, whom he finds running a post office in Massachusetts. Just the sight of Jones in short pants and knee socks is enough for a laugh. Men in Black II finds comedy in Kay's ignorance -- he has no recollection of his alien-busting past -- and also finds comedy in the role reversal that happens almost immediately after Kay gets his memory back: Suddenly he's boss again. The picture trades on the crisp banter between Smith and Jones and clever comic revelations: Who knew that aliens hold the majority of jobs in the Postal Service? Rosario Dawson, who heretofore has appeared in small films, has enough radiant close-ups in Men in Black II to assure she'll be getting lots of work in big pictures from here on out. She plays the witness to an alien homicide. Director Barry Sonnenfeld gives himself a funny cameo as the man who made the mistake of renting an apartment once lived in by Kay. There's also another surprise cameo -- by a famous pop star -- but it's disturbing. The pop star isn't playing an alien, but he looks like one. It should be admitted that no one made Men in Black II because they deeply needed to say something. There's no question that the movie is a product, but at least it doesn't give the impression that its makers felt cynical about it. On the contrary, it seems to have been made with good- natured wit. At one point, we see aliens entering the country. They're told not to go out at night, and if you must go out at night, go only to the East Village. The movie's complete lack of seriousness is, if anything, an advantage, serving to soften whatever resistance we might have to the idea of a rogue agency operating outside the Constitution, flouting rights and playing with people's minds. The last movie, though a comedy, took its heroes just seriously enough for them to be unsettling. But in Men in Black II, everything's played for laughs, and that's a good thing. ",1
"Al Gore’s first “Inconvenient” movie, “An Inconvenient Truth” (2006), alerted the general public to the climate crisis. He took an issue that was on the periphery of people’s attention and brought it center stage, and it has remained a significant area of concern ever since, both here and throughout the world.Now, 11 years later, there’s “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,” in which Gore answers all the questions you might have been wondering about since the last installment: How bad is it now? Can this be reversed? What can be done to counter the big money behind the climate-denying industry? And should we all just throw up our hands and wait for some dreaded third part in the trilogy, perhaps “An Inconvenient Apocalypse?”It’s giving away nothing to say that the answers here are a mix of good news and bad news. The good news is that leaders around the world seem to be getting serious about the climate crisis. Another strong bit of good news is that wind and solar energy are becoming less expensive than fossil fuels in many parts of the country, and those prices are continuing to drop. Altruism may be a strong motive in society, but it’s got nothing on greed. When it becomes cheaper to save the world than wreck it, instances of selfless idealism will increase exponentially.As for the bad news ... well, it’s not exactly like we have all the time in the world to do something — or a government in Washington that’s committed to the cause. There may someday be a tipping point in public opinion, but nothing is tipping yet.The new film shows the former vice president doing his slideshow throughout the world, and Gore’s presentation has lost none of its freshness and fascination. Just as raw information, this is interesting stuff, and it’s amplified by Gore’s delivery, a unique mix of self-deprecating folksiness, geekiness and evangelical zeal. This is a man who might have been president — in the opinion of many, he was the true winner of the 2000 election — and yet he is willing to talk to a roomful of only 50 people as though the future of the world depended on it.That’s the other thing that makes “An Inconvenient Sequel” compelling — Gore himself. He is a man on a crusade, and since most of us have never been on one of those, it’s quite something to witness it from the inside, particularly one waged at the highest levels of influence. Gore knows everybody. He travels regularly, appears on television, meets with journalists and activists and speaks at conferences. It’s a lot of work, but it looks like a bracing way to spend one’s time, and, though the issues are serious, it has become a fun thing to tag along with him, albeit in a virtual way.The scenes of Gore in Paris, as the Paris Agreement on global warming is being crafted, amount to a chance for audiences to have a brief seat at the grown-ups’ table. At one point, Gore wants India to sign on to the agreement, but its government is reluctant. So he starts calling banks and various businesses, in order to put together a set of conditions so favorable that the Indians have to say yes. On a human level, it’s sort of like being in high school and trying to fix up your friend with a friend of a friend — it takes lot of phone calls, and reassurance, and ego soothing. The only difference is that here, the upshot of these personal interactions will impact the fate of millions. Still, hanging over everything in “An Inconvenient Sequel” is the thing that we know and that Gore does not, and that’s the result of the 2016 presidential election. In the immediate aftermath, Gore looks like he’s suddenly in a movie he never wanted to be in, but he recovers, and he and the film find their way to an optimism that doesn’t feel forced, that feels like there actually might be hope.

"Alfie: Comedy-drama. Starring Jude Law, Marisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Charles Shyer. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The differences between the two movies are fascinating and worth lingering over, but the first thing that needs to be said is that screenwriters Elaine Pope and Charles Shyer have done a notably creative and intelligent job of adapting the old material. The new script raises the emotional stakes of the old scenes it retains, cuts plot elements that can't be updated and creates new story lines that are just as effective as those it replaces. In directing the film, Shyer grounds it in contemporary concerns, while adding just a hint of '60s atmosphere (in the women's hairstyles, especially) just for zest. The result is a smart, heartfelt film that holds up on its own terms. Like the earlier Alfie, it's the story of a sexually promiscuous man. Alfie (Law), a chauffeur, lives in a small Manhattan apartment and dedicates his life to seducing women. Talking directly into the camera, and preening with a self-satisfaction so complete as to seem a form of innocence, he expounds on clothes, the proper application of cologne and the various rules he employs in his libidinous pursuits. His goal, it seems, is to have sex with as many women as possible but to get close to none of them. This takes coldness and discipline. At the same time, in order to have some of the advantages of a stable relationship -- hot meals, comfort and someone who cares if he lives or dies -- he maintains a quasi-girlfriend in Julie (Marisa Tomei), a long-suffering single mom. Watching their interaction, it's obvious that he's using his charm to steamroll her. At the same time, we see what she sees, the glint of some fundamental decency in this guy that gives her a bit of hope. Like the earlier Alfie, the new version could be called a cautionary tale, about a way of life that leads to the existential confusion embodied in the famous catchphrase, What's it all about? But different eras make for subtle differences in presentation. The original Alfie couldn't help but capture a certain exuberance in the air -- it was made at the dawn of the sexual revolution. But the new Alfie is post-sexual revolution, and there's no mistaking the difference. This film presents its hero less as a type than as a specific guy making specific mistakes. It takes us deeper into Alfie's pain and is not impressed with his way of life. Only barely could this Alfie be considered a comedy. A major part of what makes Alfie emotionally effective is that the director invests in developing the female characters, and the actresses who play these women don't shortchange their essential dignity. Nia Long brings fire to her role as the girlfriend of Alfie's best pal (Omar Epps). There's a lovely ruefulness underscoring Marisa Tomei's performance as Alfie's almost girlfriend. And newcomer Sienna Miller is a real find as a young woman who bursts into Alfie's life, all excitement and glamour, followed by neurosis and substance abuse. Alfie may think it's just a man's world, but we can see that it's not. Susan Sarandon plays the older woman in Alfie's life, a role played in the 1966 film by Shelley Winters, and the casting difference underscores the remake's difference in tone. The original film invited us to witness their mutual seduction from a distance, as something vaguely absurd, but there's nothing absurd about Sarandon's allure. Unlike the other women in Alfie, she's at least as dangerous as he is, and she's been around. An Alfie who'd be attracted to these women is a different kind of Alfie, and so Law, taking on a part associated with another actor, is able to make the role his own. Where Caine was like an arsonist in his relationships, Law's Alfie is more like a kid playing with matches -- innocent and genuinely surprised when things start blowing up around him. Law makes Alfie's befuddlement a surprisingly poignant thing to witness. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, adult situations, nudity, drug use, strong language. ",1

Photo: Suzanne Hanover (c) 2007 Universal Studios Knocked Up: Comedy. Starring Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen. Directed by Judd Apatow. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings, and to purchase tickets for sele Like Apatow's The 40 Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up is an attempt at a different kind of screen comedy, one that can be as absurdist and even more coarse than other comedies and yet doesn't trivialize the characters. Where other filmmakers pull back, Apatow delves. Where other filmmakers give you the cliche in place of the emotion, the corny shorthand that allows the movie to resolve itself, Apatow takes his time and invites the audience to look at his characters as people. Go to Knocked Up for the laughs. Go for the fun and only later -- if you like -- consider the philosophical proposition behind making a comedy in this way. Apatow, like Woody Allen and a handful of others before him, is showing how comedy can be at least as valid a means of exploring human emotion as drama. Life is more like comedy than drama, anyway -- just look around. So why should comedy be artificial? Apatow shows how a comedy should and can be more like life, without sacrificing a laugh. Katherine Heigl plays an E channel talk show host, who gets herself pregnant right after her big break. On the fateful night, she goes to a nightclub and meets an unprepossessing, shlubby sort of guy, and for some reason likes him. She finds Ben (Seth Rogen) mildly amusing, but he's way out of her league -- younger, poorer, unemployed, badly dressed, barely groomed -- and she has no intention of going to bed with him. Then she gets drunk and does anyway. The morning-after scene shows what makes Apatow special. He doesn't go for the usual laughs by having Alison (Heigl) do something extreme (like scream in horror and throw him out), or by having Ben behave with annoying, misguided confidence. He finds the humor in the acute discomfort of the situation, as it would play in life: She is horrified and wants to keep her distance, but she is obligated not to be rude. And he likes her and would like to see her again, but he can tell that she can't wait to get away. The scene is funny, because the situation is awkward, and the awkwardness is the product of the characters' fullness and awareness. Neither is stupid. They both know exactly what's going on. Once Alison is pregnant, the abortion option is handled with perception and economy: She has lunch with her know-it-all mother, who tells her that she obviously must terminate the pregnancy. That's it. She's having a baby. From there Knocked Up really takes it time, tracing the effect of the pregnancy on Alison and Ben, together and separately, and on their friends and family. Taken one by one, the scenes are invariably funny, but the overarching ideas of the film are all about growth and human potential. Actually, The 40 Year Old Virgin was like that, too. Apatow makes good use of the extended running time by looking into the unhappy marriage of Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd). These side characters, who'd usually be given short shrift as mere comic sounding boards for the protagonists, are examined with unexpected fullness and feeling. On the downside, some of the humor involving Ben's living situation, with a bunch of slacker potheads, is labored and repetitive. Yet even then, Apatow's eye for the zany touch never leaves him. He gets a lot of mileage, for example, out of a bit about a guy losing a bet and not being able to shave. Every time we see him, his beard is longer, and he's more miserable. There's a lot more here, but it's best left to be discovered. Knocked Up has some rough edges, but it's a noteworthy film by a significant and blossoming talent. -- Advisory: Simulated sex, drug use, sexual situations, harsh language and nudity. ",1
"Amazing Grace: Drama. Starring Ioan Gruffudd, Albert Finney, Benedict Cumberbatch and Romola Garai. Directed by Michael Apted. (PG. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle on 'Number 23,' 'Days of Glory,' 'Amazing Grace.']When a movie resurrects a moment from history, with the confident hope, as always, that audiences will respond, the question that comes to mind is Why? That is, what is it about this story in particular that's supposed to connect with modern viewers? In this case, it may not be anything obvious or specific. Yet there's something about Wilberforce's frustration at the organized indifference he faces (the conjoining of the slave trade and government) and something about the physical and emotional toll taken on Wilberforce's health and spirit that make the story ring true and feel significant. Anyone who has ever felt morally right and completely in the minority will have a point of entry into this movie. It begins in the middle and is told in two directions, moving forward and flashing back, a strategy that produces dramatic dividends in that it finds Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) at his lowest ebb. Once a young dynamo, he has lost his energy and confidence. He's feeling middle-aged and suffering from bouts of colitis. Yet, thankfully, he's still in good enough shape for friends to introduce him to a young, pretty admirer, Barbara (Romola Garai). When the two finally get a chance to talk, it's as though they've just met through one of those modern-day liberal dating services. They agree about everything -- about the slave trade, abolition and animal rights. Wilberforce led a life of drama and commitment, and Amazing Grace sticks close to the historical record: The film shows him experiencing, in his late 20s, a sudden religious revelation, and for a time he considers leaving politics. But he's encouraged by a number of people -- including John Newton (Albert Finney), the author of Amazing Grace -- that if he wants to do God's work, politics is exactly what he should be pursuing. This decision, to put his faith to work in the public sphere, forms the practical basis for his life. (Wilberforce went on to write a book, still in print, called A Practical Guide to Christianity.) It gives him the drive and conviction that his more cynical colleagues lack, but it also makes it easier for them to write him off as a crank. Gruffudd conveys well the nature of Wilberforce's frustration. He is 50 years ahead of his time, seeing what is obviously wrong and arguing for what's right, while others are stuck in the dark. His friendship with William Pitt the Younger -- the youngest prime minister in British history -- is his most important alliance, and to a degree that's both unexpected and welcome, this story of a relentless idealist is grounded in the nitty-gritty of hard-nosed politics. As Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch strikes a nice note with regard to Wilberforce, sometimes envying his conviction, sometimes scorning his naivete. He's a proud man who nonetheless can't help but recognize that Wilberforce -- though his inferior in every other way -- is his moral superior. All the bases are covered, practical and spiritual. Wilberforce's great rapport with the woman who becomes his wife suggests a rich private life, and the movie never lets the audience forget the nature of the evil that Wilberforce wants to eradicate. The scenes with Finney, as the former slave trader, give details about the slave trade, and the horrors that took place on the slave ships are beyond description. Even those who think they know all about it will be moved, and not just moved -- angered. How could a nation that aspired to civilization, that by 1800 had given the world the Magna Carta and the Glorious Revolution, and Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth, descend into such heartless barbarity? Wilberforce was wondering that, too, and in Amazing Grace we're right there with him. -- Advisory: Adult themes. ",1
"American Dreamz: Comedy. Starring Hugh Grant, Mandy Moore, Sam Golzari and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Paul Weitz. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The intent here seems to be to satirize without offending -- or at least without enraging anybody. Thus, we get Dennis Quaid doing a flat-out send-up of President Bush as a complete imbecile, but a sweet-natured and humble imbecile, with benign instincts. At the picture begins, he has just won re-election and is finally getting around to taking an interest in world affairs, at least enough to start reading newspapers. This distresses his chief of staff, played by Willem Dafoe, a Svengali figure who acts like Karl Rove but is made up to resemble Dick Cheney. From the news, President Staton gleans that there are three kinds of Iraq-istanis, Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds, and that they really hate each other. This is his discovery, three years into the war. Afraid that the president will start to learn more, his chief of staff sedates him with happy pills and encourages him to make public appearances, wearing an earpiece so he can feed him his lines. Depicting Bush as a sweet moron is a cliche that will irritate some and not completely satisfy anybody, as the movie doesn't come close hitting any raw nerves, except perhaps when President Staton starts to doubt if he really was chosen by God for the presidency, that maybe it was all just a terrible fluke. Also askew -- not caustic enough, not funny enough -- is Weitz's portrayal of an al Qaeda training camp in slapstick terms. In truth, the element for satire is not that they're bumblers, or harmless. The element for satire, if any, is that they're off their rockers. But Weitz recovers and gets on surer ground when he turns his attention to American Idol, here known as American Dreamz. (The comedy is funny, even if, like me, you've never seen American Idol.) Hugh Grant, who has found his niche as a superficial cad, plays Martin Tweed, the English-born host of the TV sensation. To maintain his show's place at the top of the ratings, he tells his associates that he wants to recruit freaks for the upcoming season. His crew finds one in Orange County, an Arab (an undercover Al Qaeda operative) named Omer (Sam Golzari) who can't dance and can hardly sing but who loves show tunes. He is coached for his audition by his acerbic gay cousin, an Americanized Arab played with panache by Tony Yalda. The crew also finds a more conventional contestant in Sally Kendoo, a girl next door from Middle America, with blonde good looks, an ingratiating manner and an all-consuming ambition that would put Lady Macbeth to shame. Sally is played by Mandy Moore, who throughout her fairly modest film career has always been better than she's had to be. She has the capacity for playing more than one emotion at once, for a kind of spontaneous, moment-by-moment complexity, and her range extends from tragedy to farce. Here she's a filmmaker's dream, taking a role that easily could have been a one-note joke and turning it into something deeper, more monstrous, more funny and more real. Her burgeoning connection with the older and more powerful Martin Tweed -- based on their recognition of each other's fraudulence and spiritual deadness -- is one of the movie's most satisfying elements. Moore's also quite good in her scenes with Chris Klein, as her sickeningly kind boyfriend, for whom she can barely contain her contempt. American Dreamz is the rare case of a movie that gets better as it goes along, heading toward a climactic scene in which the president goes on American Dreamz as a judge. Quaid is at his best here, as a lost and dazed president, helpless without his earpiece, trying to improvise. It's the one scene in which Weitz almost takes the gloves off. -- Advisory: Sexual situations and humor. ",1
"Andrew Garfield stars as Peter Parker in the new Spider-Man film.Andrew Garfield stars as Peter Parker in the new Spider-Man film. Action. Starring Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans. Directed by Marc Webb. (PG-13. 136 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Spider-Man is back again. He's young again. He's discovering love, realizing his powers, and this time he's doing it in three dimensions and, if you like, in Imax. His girlfriend used to be Kirsten Dunst. Now it's Emma Stone. He used to be shorter and have lighter hair. Now he's Andrew Garfield. He's doing well. First, the bottom line, then we'll fill in the details: The Amazing Spider-Man is a good Spider-Man movie. A case could be made - it could be made here, and with enthusiasm - that this is not exactly a story that needs to be told, no, not again. But the story has been told; the movie is here, and the movie before us is a lot better than it has a right to be.  It's generally best to talk about films on their own terms, without comparing them to other pictures. But The Amazing Spider-Man might be the one exception. People want to know if the new movie is better or worse than the previous Spider-Man entries, and the answer to that question is yes and no, but mostly yes. Or to put it another way, this is the second-best Spider-Man movie yet made. In the previous trilogy, only Spider-Man 2 surpasses it. The new movie benefits from recent strides in computer graphics, so that now, finally, when Spider-Man swings from building to building, he no longer looks like a little stick figure bobbing up and down on a computer screen. The effects are convincing in both long and medium shot, such that you stop thinking of them as effects and start reacting to them, getting weak-kneed as Spider-Man teeters from the edge of skyscrapers. This is also a rare recent example of a 3-D movie that makes good use of three dimensions.  As Peter Parker, the high school student whose career begins when he is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, Garfield is not nearly as charming or as idiosyncratic as Tobey Maguire. But Maguire's reflective quality often rendered him passive. Garfield, a good actor, has a prickly, ruffled undertone that makes him, by nature, more active, more angry and more suited to prowling the streets at night. It's easier to believe in his anger. The new movie delves a bit further into the backstory. One night, years in the past, Peter's parents need to leave town in a hurry, so they drop him off at the aunt and uncle's house and never come back. Peter ends up with Martin Sheen as a surrogate dad - winning! - with Sally Field, in effect, fulfilling motherly duties. Field's role doesn't amount to much besides fretting, though she can fret with the best of them, but Sheen gets to land Uncle Ben as the fundamental pillar of Peter's moral decency.  This time around the filmmakers seem a little more serious about sticking to the original source, the comic books by Stan Lee, and so Stone doesn't play Mary Jane (as did Dunst) but Gwen, who was Peter's high school girlfriend. No one will improve on Dunst, but Stone brings some of the same wise kindness and humor to her role, and so Peter is in good hands. Part of the fun of any first Spider-Man installment is in waiting for Peter to recognize his newfound Spider-Man abilities, and yet the revelation scene in The Amazing Spider-Man is a disappointment. It's just a rather drab interlude on a New York subway car, which Peter accidentally demolishes. In this scene and others, first-time feature director Marc Webb has too much of a tendency to film action scenes with a series of tight close-ups. But there really is no arguing with the story, which is grand scale without losing the human scale. I hesitate to mention the villain of the piece, because I wasn't sure for half the film who the villain would turn out to be. Suffice it to say, there are nuances to the villainy here, worthy of a good comic book, and not a bad cartoon, even if the stakes are as extreme as the possible destruction of New York City and the genetic corruption of the human species. Denis Leary, who has made a good career out of grumpiness, plays Gwen's dad, the New York City police chief, and he's exactly the right kind of unsmiling guy that no teenage boy would want as his girlfriend's father. He's scary enough without adding in the fact that he is convinced that Spider-Man is a social menace and must be stopped. ",1
"Animation. Featuring the voices of Jim Cummings, John Cleese and Bud Luckey. Directed by Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall. (G. 65 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The makers of Winnie the Pooh had enough material for a good 65 minutes, and so they did something unusual, practically unheard of in modern times. They made a 65-minute movie. They didn't stretch things out for an additional half hour. Instead, they took mercy on parents and were realistic about the attention span of their target audience, and the result is a nice little movie that does its job and doesn't spread misery under cover of spreading joy. Winnie the Pooh is unusual in other ways, too. Winnie does not come at you in three dimensions, and the voices on the soundtrack are not of very famous people showing off. The animation is old school, and the songs - it's a musical - have a 1960s vibe. No, they don't sound like Hendrix, but rather like the music from children's movies of the '60s, and the overall feeling is of a world of innocence and of a movie that you can relax with.  Accentuating the 1960s link is Jim Cummings as Pooh, who in his vocal characterization pays tribute to Sterling Holloway, who was the voice of Pooh in a number of movies. Like those earlier animations, this is a straight-up children's film, and I mean children. There's no bathroom humor for older kids entering that weird presexual age where the mere suggestion of flatulence sends them into laughing fits, and there are no jokes meant to go over the kiddies' heads. What will amuse parents, instead, is the cinematic oasis of something sane and kind to show their children. So Eeyore has misplaced his tail, which makes him more depressed than usual, and Winnie and his friends go looking for it. Along the way, Winnie looks for honey, and that's about it, folks. He's a little bear, he's hungry, but he wants to help his friend, too. That's all there is, and all you need to know, though I'll add, too, that this movie reminded me of being 6, and I liked the reminder.",1
"Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley in The Fault in Our Stars.Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley in The Fault in Our Stars. Drama. Starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort. Directed by Josh Boone. (PG-13. 125 minutes.)It's hard to be definitive about The Fault in Our Stars. It's exploitative in the most obvious ways, and yet sincere. It's a product of sophisticated market calculation, and yet artless in its immediacy. It's nothing you'd ever want to put yourself through twice, and yet it's effective in the moment. Shrewdly prefabricated and yet lovingly assembled, it is, in short, the most beautifully made cynical thing I've ever seen.So what do you say about a movie like that? If films were like mathematics, you'd take an average of almost great and almost awful and end up with fair or just OK. But The Fault in Our Stars, based on John Green's novel, is the furthest thing from fair or OK. It really is almost great and almost awful interchangeably, sometimes simultaneously. Manipulative in the worst way, it's also manipulative in the best way, so that, in order to be unmoved by it, you would have to try actively to be a jerk. Go in with anything short of willful disengagement, and you will be swept up - at times.A love story about two teenagers with cancer, the title comes from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, but the action is more like Romeo and Juliet - a tale of first love in all its passions, only with cancer replacing the Capulet-Montague conflict. Shailene Woodley is Hazel, whose thyroid cancer has become lung cancer. She's 17 and goes around rolling an oxygen tank behind her, but at the moment, her condition is stable.At a cancer support group, she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort), who is at least as handsome as the two guys in Twilight, and also acerbic and unshakably confident, despite having lost a leg to the disease. In remission, he's at the meeting in support of a friend, but as soon as he sees Hazel, he's in love. Following the familiar pattern of stories directed at girls, he thinks Hazel is beautiful, knows how amazingly awesome she is, but makes no physical demands. He is willing to wait around and be charming.If the above sounds formulaic and calculated, other elements don't. At one point, early in the story, Hazel is presented with an opportunity to fulfill a life dream, to travel to Amsterdam and meet her favorite author. But it's touch and go whether her health will allow for such a trip. The emotion attached to this is enormous, and not just for the characters. It feels like an oppressive cruelty that this should even be a question - that a 17-year-old kid might not survive a plane ride - and if you see The Fault in Our Stars, you will want that girl to have that experience more than you can possibly imagine.Such is the pattern throughout - scenes of calculated banter, with phony interactions that feel straight out of some routine product, followed by moments of universal truth and aching power. The story can be outguessed within five minutes, at least in its broad outlines, and yet its many details are often surprising and illuminating. The plotline involving Hazel's dealing with her favorite author (Willem Dafoe) is particularly strong in the way it highlights her growth.Woodley starts slow, in what seems like a largely reactive role, but as the movie wears on, her performance deepens. At times, she has a quality of looking like both a young girl and an old lady, as if she has crammed a lifetime's worth of maturity into just a few years. In a key scene, she has a speech, in which she tells Augustus everything he means to her, which she does with such simplicity and a fullness of feeling that it's wondrous. There's no minimizing that: It's a beautiful moment.She is well matched by Elgort, who is no mere abstraction of a teenage girl's dream, but brings to Augustus a tangle of interesting and conflicting qualities. He is cocky and egotistical, but genuinely warm; clearly a kid going places, and yet vulnerable in surprising ways. If Woodley shows us the adult within the teenager, Elgort's journey is to show us the kid within the adult facade.The quality of the acting and the rightness of Woodley and Elgort as a couple are major weights to put into the balance. And when you add in the movie's unwillingness to sugarcoat the awfulness of what its protagonists are facing, The Fault in Our Stars has to be considered some kind of good movie. And so I've given it some kind of good review.Still, I wonder - why do I feel as I've just been rolled?  ",1
"Anyone knowing anything about “Freeheld” knows that it’s the fact-based story of a terminally ill lesbian who went to court to ensure that her domestic partner inherited her pension benefits. This took place in 2005 and 2006, in the state of New Jersey, where inheritance rights for domestic partners were not guaranteed at the time.Yet for about half of “Freeheld,” the movie is not about a court case but a courtship. Laurel Hester (Julianne Moore) is a career investigator with the police department in Ocean City, and her private life is a mystery to her co-workers, even her partner (Michael Shannon), who is rather hopelessly attracted to her. She meets Stacie (Ellen Page) while playing volleyball, and the two gradually become a couple.Couples that last usually have an interesting power dynamic in which one partner can never completely dominate the other. Stacie is bolder in her sexuality — she’s completely out in a way that Laurel isn’t. At the same time, Laurel is about 20 years older and more advanced in her career, which gives her a certain edge in the relationship. The give-and-take between Laurel and Stacie — and Moore and Page — is complicated and appealing. We’d like being around them even if the movie weren’t heading somewhere, though, alas, “Freeheld” never does let us forget where it’s heading. As Laurel, Moore is smoking almost constantly, by way of preparing us for the lung cancer that takes over the story.Beyond the specifics of the case, “Freeheld” is really a document in favor of gay marriage, making an argument in the most unimpeachable terms imaginable. (It also, typical of movies, makes the argument after public opinion has already shifted on the issue and the cause is already won.) Laurel is not just a nice person who deserves rights, but also an honest cop with a long history of public service. To deny her what a straight person would get as a matter of course, and to fill her last days with anxiety, seems obscene.It would be an interesting exercise to compare “Freeheld” to “Philadelphia” to measure the movement in public opinion. During the depths of the AIDS crisis in 1993, “Philadelphia” reduced the awfulness of the protagonist’s imminent and untimely death into a court case about his losing his job. Losing his job was the least of his problems, but it was as if the public needed that element rather than have to face directly what was happening to gay people in that dark time.You might say “Philadelphia” was a way of acknowledging the humanity of the protagonist (and those he stood for) obliquely. “Freeheld,” by contrast, recognizes that humanity as a given and makes the case for complete legal and social equality — but again, by using a terminally ill protagonist as a kind of insurance against censure. Societies change, but the movies stay the same.Julianne Moore gives us a proud woman dragged unwillingly into the abyss of illness, and she is emotionally and physically convincing as someone in her last days. But after “Still Alice,” I’m getting a little sick of watching Moore get sick, and I would like her to stay healthy for an entire film. As Stacie, Page is lovely, giving us someone who is boyish and bashful and not afraid to show when she feels in over her head. Also worth noting is Shannon, who has the iciest stare in the business. Has he ever broken gaze first? No, but then why should he?“Freeheld” is formulaic, but some formulas are good if you do them right, and it helps knowing that it all really happened, or most of it. During the closing credits, they show pictures of the real Laurel and Stacie, and it’s clear that these images informed the making of the film.

"Anyone looking casually at the advertisements and coming attractions for “The Edge of Seventeen” might easily come away expecting something typical — a standard entry in the coming-of-age comedy genre. But while “The Edge of Seventeen” does deliver on the promise of being funny, it’s mostly dead serious and deserving of respect and attention. It’s far from the usual thing — and better than the usual thing.Written and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig, making her feature film debut, the movie presents us with a very distinct character, not an EveryTeenager, but someone specific, edgy and interesting. Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) is profane and loquacious, outgoing and yet insecure, needlessly cynical and inappropriately romantic. She comes off as assertive, but says things like, “I heard my voice in a voice mail — how can anyone stand me?” She has the makings of a terrific woman, but she is miserable as a teenager, and her family situation isn’t great, either.Her one sure hold on emotional security is her friendship with Krista (Haley Lu Richardson), who is as calm and reflective as Nadine is erratic. The filmmaker captures a nice dynamic we don’t often see in movies, though we can recognize it from life. Nadine dominates Krista. She is the prime mover in everything they do. And yet Nadine needs Krista a bit more than Krista needs Nadine. Such odd balances in power are often at the heart of lifelong friendships.Then something simple happens that upends Nadine’s world: Krista enters into a relationship with Nadine’s older brother (Blake Jenner). This presents a big problem for lots of reasons, only some of which are conscious. Her brother is popular in school, and he’s popular in the household, the favorite of their mother (Kyra Sedgwick). In going out with Krista, it’s as if the brother is snatching from her the only thing Nadine has that is hers. Most of “The Edge of Seventeen” takes place over a handful of days, as Nadine reacts to the change in circumstances and goes into a tailspin. Nadine’s behavior may be irrational, but at every point it’s understandable, and the movie finds drama in the everyday, without ever resorting to the unusual or sensational. Nadine’s problems remain human scale — loneliness, social embarrassment, the threat of humiliation.Woody Harrelson has a featured role as one of Nadine’s teachers, and he provides a sardonic sounding board for her melodramatic rants. Like everything else in the film, this teacher is not quite what you’d expect. He’s not that concerned — he’d really rather be left alone. And there’s a very strong suggestion that he’s probably lousy at his job, just punching a clock and phoning it in. Harrelson finds the humor in that, in the exhaustion of an adult who has to listen to kids all day, but who feels his real life is elsewhere.As Nadine, Steinfeld has never been better. It might even be true to say that she’s never really been particularly good until now. Her roles have mainly been restrained, but here she gets to let loose, play big, run with scenes and follow her inspiration. What a wonderful liberation it is not to have to act nice all the time. And everyone surrounding her is superb — not just Harrelson, but Sedgwick, Jenner and Richardson.This is a film in which the actors listen carefully and play off of each other every scene. Watch Steinfeld and Richardson in the diner scene, in particular, about a third into the movie, in which they talk about Krista’s involvement with the brother. These are two young actresses, barely 20 years old, but the director creates for them an environment in which they can be spontaneous and in the moment. Just savor the human spectacle of people actually thinking on screen, feeling things, reacting as the other talks. Kelly Fremon Craig is a good writer, who is also a good director, and “The Edge of Seventeen” is the beginning of a career worth watching.",1
"Aristocrats: Documentary. Written, recorded and directed by Paul Provenza and PennJillette. (Unrated. 86 minutes. At the Bridge Theatre.) The joke itself is not particularly funny. Its appeal to comedians is that it allows for endless variations. It has a beginning, and it has a punch line -- The aristocrats! -- but the middle changes with each teller. The laughs, when they do come, inevitably come in the middle, with shock and appreciation for the comedian's inventiveness and daring. In each case, the goal is to create the most offensive, obscene, appalling joke possible. Though the specifics of the joke are revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie, those specifics are best left a surprise. In a sense, it's the only surprise in 86 minutes. There's no more information to be had, no stepping back into formal documentary mode to discuss the history of the joke, no analysis of the Freudian implications of the joke, nothing besides comedians talking about the joke and telling it themselves. After 15 minutes, it seems almost impossible that the filmmakers, comedians Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza, can maintain this pace and stay on this theme for the length of a movie. The premise seems on the verge of exhaustion, worthy of a two-reel short, maybe, but not a feature movie. But like the joke, the filmmakers keep their movie alive, not by changing any of the fundamentals but by finding new ways to embroider the basic material. The Aristocrats could have been made only by successful comics. Jillette and Provenza get literally of dozens of comedians, veterans, up-and- comers, TV stars, Vegas attractions and comedy writers to speak to them. They talk to Jon Stewart and Bob Saget in their respective dressing rooms, right before a performance. They get to Drew Carey on the set. Their bench is so deep that some of the bigger names, such as Whoopi Goldberg, don't even show up until the middle, and some just pop in (Chris Rock), say one thing and aren't heard from again. Even more important, Jillette and Provenza's celebrity access enabled them to capture comedians talking as fellow professionals, in a relaxed, expansive way. There are many highlights: George Carlin makes perceptive insights into the way the joke works. Martin Mull works a structural variation on the joke that, in a way, improves it. Paul Reiser, staying within the structure, does a good job with it. Carey adds a visual flourish to the punch line. Saget shocks himself with a protracted and particularly obscene rendition. Tommy Smothers, who is familiar with the joke, tells it to Dick Smothers, who has never heard it. And Steven Wright succeeds in turning the Aristocrats into a Steven Wright joke, with comic results. Two comedians in particular stand out. Sarah Silverman does a wonderfully creepy version of the Aristocrats, in which she tells the joke as though it happened to her. And Gilbert Gottfried goes for broke with it, once for the documentary cameras and once for an audience in 2001. Gottfried's live performance, taped only a couple of weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is the climax of the documentary. It's satisfying to see the joke played before a crowd, especially by a comedian with brilliant timing and no limits. The one flaw of the segment -- and the one glaring flaw of this otherwise shrewd documentary -- is that the filmmakers don't let the scene breathe. They keep intercutting Gottfried with people talking about Gottfried. It's the classic example of telling versus showing, and for some reason, the filmmakers make the wrong choice. -- Advisory: Foul language and vivid descriptions of incest and coprophilia. ",1
"As a subject, “I Am Michael” is a minefield. It’s the story of Michael Glatze, a gay activist and writer who converted to Christianity, stopped identifying as gay and married a woman. There’s a lot of emotion attached to this, a lot of political feeling, and a lot of ways writer-director Justin Kelly could have gone wrong here. These are easy to imagine. What’s harder to imagine is how Kelly actually succeeds. He tells “I Am Michael” as a resolutely personal story of one man, while at the same time allowing himself a point of view that comes through in the storytelling, particularly through James Franco’s performance as Glatze.As the film begins, Glatze is in a long-term relationship with his boyfriend, Bennett (Zachary Quinto), living in San Francisco, and writing for XY Magazine. A series of panic attacks makes him believe he has a heart condition — his father died young from heart disease — and after that scare, he starts to re-evaluate his life. He becomes interested in Mormonism, then shifts to evangelical Christianity, and gradually feels alienated from his gay identity.There are two general ways to watch the process of Glatze’s conversion. One way is to see this as a spiritual crisis, a case of a man having a genuine religious experience and going through a certain amount of necessary turmoil to adjust his life to his new beliefs. The other way is to see him as cracking up and seizing on religion as an almost arbitrary life raft in the storm of his own terror and confusion. There are combinations and various shadings between those two extremes, but those are the basic polarities to choose from.Kelly does something really skillful and sensitive here. He has absolute respect for Glatze’s experience. Glatze emerges as a sympathetic, striving person — and it should be said that Glatze himself likes the film. Yet there’s little question that the movie leans toward the second interpretation, that the religious conversion was a denial of Glatze’s essential self, brought on by an emotional crisis that we can never really fathom.But to state the movie’s point of view so starkly doesn’t do justice to the complexity of its position, nor to the possibilities it leaves open to interpretation: Maybe gay life wasn’t for Glatze. Maybe he was more bisexual than gay. Maybe he’s happier now. Maybe he was happier then. He certainly looks happier at the beginning of the movie than he does at the end. Yet, in the film, he says he has discovered his true self. Perhaps in some way he has. Or he’s delusional. Or his true self is to be deluded ... Franco gives a sensitive performance, and this is a film worth seeing, but it’s not easy to see. Two years ago it played in San Francisco, when it opened the Frameline festival. Friday, Jan. 27, it opens at the AMC Mercado in San Jose, but the easiest way to see it is on Video on Demand. But keep in mind:  This is a movie you might want to talk about afterward, so try to see it with other people.",1
"As it is with “The Post,” so it is with many Steven Spielberg movies. We sit there, a little interested, a little bit detached, thinking, well, this is OK, nothing special, but perfectly fine. And then — who knows how he does it? — the camera moves in on a face, the soundtrack swells, and suddenly half the crowd has tears in their eyes, and you’re one of them.In “The Post,” the moment comes when the political columnist Meg Greenfield (Carrie Coon) gets word of a Supreme Court decision concerning a newspaper’s right to publish material gleaned from whistle-blowers. She holds the phone and repeats to her colleagues the decision of Justice Hugo Black: that America’s founders affirmed freedom of the press “to serve the governed, not the governors.” And if someone could put a mirror in front of your face as you watch this, you’d be surprised at your own transport and wonder.Spielberg is so good at this sort of thing that the question raises itself: Is he feeling it, too, or is he just a master manipulator? In a way, the question is immaterial — the movie is the movie, however it’s made — and yet it would be nice to know if we’re all just that easy.Spielberg crafts another moment, almost as effective. Publisher Katharine Graham leaves the courthouse after testifying on behalf of her newspaper, and a phalanx of young women watches her walk down the steps, in speechless awe. Did it really happen that way? Probably not. Is the scene so obvious that the ghost of Frank Capra himself would call it corny? Oh yes. But Spielberg knows something about movies, and that tableau, obvious though it may be, is lovely.It also hammers home the feminist nature of this real-life journalism tale. “The Post” is set in 1971 and deals with the Washington Post’s decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, a leaked secret report proving that just about everything presidential administrations had said about the Vietnam War was a lie. By this time the New York Times had run some stories, but they’d been silenced by a court injunction. Now it was up to Graham whether to risk violating the court order by publishing the papers in the Post.As played by Meryl Streep, Graham is a woman from an earlier time who became the boss only because her husband died. The newspaper, owned by her father, was in a sense part of her dowry — and she took it for granted that her husband should be in charge. Now that it’s all hers, she has to push through her own insecurities and the stridency and condescension of her board of directors in order to find herself. “The Post” is a rare coming-of-age film, in that it’s about a woman’s coming of age in her mid-50s. Yet for middle-aged women of that second-wave feminist era, this was not an unusual phenomenon.“The Post” is on safe ground when it focuses on Streep as Graham — tentative, slightly affected, but growing by the day — and with Graham’s relationship with her gruff, hotshot editor, Ben Bradlee, played by Tom Hanks, against type but winningly. The movie’s challenge is the journalism story, which is not as clear-cut as Watergate and is therefore harder to dramatize.In fact, as a story, the whole Pentagon Papers saga has everything against it. The revelations were about the Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, but Nixon was now president. The papers didn’t represent one story, but a number of stories. And the stories themselves were complex, not as simple as dirty tricks, a break-in and a cover-up — or, as in “Spotlight,” priests molesting boys. Also, the reporters didn’t have to dig for the story. It landed on their lap, thousands of undigested pages, which they had to read.These challenges can’t completely be overcome, no matter how many times they crank up the John Williams score, and so the movie sags in the middle. Still, when Spielberg has to bring it home, he does. If the intention was to send audiences out feeling inspired about journalism and its function in a republic, consider that mission accomplished.Finally, it hardly needs to be said, and yet it needs to be acknowledged, that everyone connected with the film was thinking about the story in terms of today’s events. “The Post” was filmed in a hurry — principal photography began at the end of May — with the intention of celebrating an institution and a profession under constant attack by the present administration. As such, “The Post” is not just a pretty good Spielberg picture, but mainstream Hollywood’s first response to life in the Trump era — the trickle before the flood.",1
"Assault on Precinct 13: Crime drama. Starring Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, Brian Dennehy and Drea de Matteo. Directed by Jean-Francois Richet. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Assault on Precinct 13 matches a dingy urban setting with a compelling situation and throws in an ensemble of interesting characters who become even more interesting under stress. This emphasis on character -- in a sense, the movie's underlying humanity -- is what especially links it to the 1970s. Thirty years ago, thrillers like The French Connection and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three weren't just crime movies but character studies. The character under the microscope here is Sgt. Roenick (Ethan Hawke), once a cocksure undercover Detroit cop and now a burnt-out, hesitant fellow with a desk job and a pill habit. We first meet him during his undercover phase. He poses as a coked-up drug dealer, talking about how the drugs he's selling are the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria of consciousness exploration. Right away -- within the first two minutes -- this is obviously a good movie. The script is fun. The editing is vigorous but coherent, and Hawke's attack on the role is loose and inspired. Clearly, the director, Jean-Francois Richet, knows his own business, and knows how bring out the best in his actors. When we next encounter Roenick, eight months and a whole credit sequence later, it's New Year's Eve, and he's a shadow of the brash young man he once was. He gets visited on the job by a police psychologist (Maria Bello), whom he tries to divert by flirting and making wisecracks. Hawke scores another nice acting moment,when, after challenging the psychologist to tell him what she thinks is wrong with him, he's forced to listen to her name his private fears. It's the look of someone who thinks he's fully covered and finds out he's naked. At the precinct are Brian Dennehy, as an old cop about to retire (uh-oh), and Drea de Matteo, as the precinct secretary. De Matteo, best known for playing Adrianna on The Sopranos, gets to drop the New York accent and speak in her normal voice, and it's amazing how that opens up her entire essence. She's not pinched or furrowed, but relaxed and refreshingly normal. Assault on Precinct 13 is about a siege, and so all the story elements must come together on this one night, in this one place. Laurence Fishburne plays Bishop, a criminal kingpin under police custody. Because of bad weather, a police van containing Bishop and some other prisoners is diverted to Precinct 13 for the night. So it's a few cops, a handful of crooks and a secretary, on a snowy night, in an isolated precinct. Bishop is a dangerous man, calm, deliberate and serious, and whomever he looks at gets a little scared. Fishburne just has to stand there to sell it. He is a powerful, and underused, screen presence. No sooner has Bishop arrived than people start trying to break into the precinct. Then people start shooting through the windows. Who are they? What are they after? I'll never tell. The film traces the shifting strategies and alliances of people in a life- and-death crisis, and the acting is superb all the way through the cast. In addition to Fishburne and Hawke, whose characters develop a wary mutual respect, there's Maria Bello, who's quirky and sympathetic as a thoroughly terrified professional stuck there by happenstance, and John Leguizamo, who plays one of the prisoners, a delusional junkie and petty criminal. What makes Leguizamo so convincing is that he's so without vanity. He doesn't sneak out from behind the character to wink at the audience -- he does nothing to assure the viewer that he's any smarter than the character. In fact, if you've never seen Leguizamo before, you could easily think that they went out and got a pathetic delusional junkie to play a pathetic delusional junkie. There's no higher praise. -- Advisory: This film contains strong violence. ",1
"BANDITS: Crime comedy. Starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett. Directed by Barry Levinson. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet taken as a whole, Bandits is a success, a two-hour entertainment that floats along, stumbling into various genres, discovering its moments. The cast -- Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett -- is as eclectic and unexpectedly charming as the movie. Somehow, Bandits works -- except with movies there is no somehow. Director Barry Levinson brought this one home, finding, amid the flashy performances and wild swings of tone, a thin cord of truth, between zaniness and naturalism, that allows it to hang together. Any time someone makes a film that's not quite like any other, that's good news for two reasons. The first is that any artistic advance, however minor, is welcome. The other is that movies that aren't designed to formula are rarely financed. They're harder to make and even harder to market. Bandits isn't any better than a good formula picture - - it isn't incisive or memorable, just light and amusing -- but it's different. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton play Joe and Terry, convicts who break out of prison one afternoon and have to improvise from there. They rob a bank and hide out, then devise a plan to rob more banks, in order to raise money for a beachfront restaurant in Mexico. Everybody has a dream, and that's theirs. To minimize their risks, they come up with a novel way to rob banks. They show up at the bank manager's home the night before, sleep over and go to work with the manager the next morning. The safe is opened. They take the money and leave. The bank scenes, even when things go wrong, play flatter than they should. The audience is so sure -- too sure -- of Joe and Terry's basic decency that there's no real worry that they might hurt somebody. This is where the comedy drains some of the suspense, perhaps more than necessary. The filmmakers might have taken more of a chance with the audience's affections and made Joe and Terry just a bit darker. As Terry, Thornton has the crowd-pleasing role. He's a worrier and a mass of imagined ailments, plagued by hypochondria, fits of blinking and some unique and inspired phobias, including Benjamin Disraeli's hair. He is so easy to manipulate that, at one point, Joe tells him a fake story about a brain-tumor victim, knowing this will result in Terry's becoming immobilized with the same symptoms. Thornton has some funny moments of physical comedy, as he gradually imagines that his entire right side has become paralyzed. Willis as Joe is like the Willis of a dozen other movies, but that's not a bad thing. His masculine authority provides the movie's only -- and much- needed -- dose of menace. His stillness can be alarming, even if it's undercut here by the most unconvincing hairpiece of his career. The performance of Cate Blanchett would be a revelation, except that her versatility has been demonstrated in every film she has made since Elizabeth.  Here she is a neglected trophy wife who becomes Joe and Terry's willing hostage. Kate (Blanchett) is unbalanced and miserable, a combustible element brought into the men's partnership. Even worse, she's a Bonnie Tyler (Total Eclipse of the Heart) fan. The men fall in love with her, but at least they're harder to get than the audience, which needs only a single shot: Blanchett replaces her refrigerator light with a blue bulb. The shot of Blanchett bathed in blue light is stunning, her face glowing like that of a star from the glamour era. As the picture wears on, the focus is less on crime and more on the three-way romance. Blanchett makes the shift in emphasis seem right. Bandits was shot on location throughout Oregon and Northern California, and Bay Area audiences may recognize some locations, which include the Flamingo Hotel in Santa Rosa and the Charthouse Restaurant in Montara. . &gt;&gt; This film contains sexual situations and mild violence.

"BEVERLY HILLS NINJA: Comedy. Starring Chris Farley and Nicollette Sheridan. Directed by Dennis Dugan. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The premise is as obvious as a 250- pound guy in a ninja outfit. That's the movie's one joke -- contrasting the precision of the ninja with the out-of- control physicality of comedian Chris Farley -- and it doesn't sound like much. But that incongruity is enough for three big laughs before the opening credits are even finished, and the jokes keep coming. This is a movie in which the audience knows half the gags in advance, but thanks to director Dennis Dugan's timing and Farley's execution, the audience doesn't just laugh anyway, but laughs harder. Knowing in advance is part of the fun. One example: There's a running joke in which the spirit of the young ninja (Farley) leaves his body to commune with his ninja master. Each time his spirit returns, the impact sends Farley blasting backward, through walls and windows. The bit gets funnier each time. Playing a young American raised in a dojo (a Japanese school for self-defense training), Farley has a terrific scene in which he tries to impress a woman who comes looking to hire a ninja. Pretending at an icy composure, he is, in fact, a flustered wreck, and he ends up taking the dojo apart -- smashing the urns of the great ancestors and setting fire to the sacred scrolls. Farley is at his best playing someone trying to contain an innate hysteria. That's why the ninja gimmick is an inspiration. When the young ninja acciden tally finds himself onstage in a Beverly Hills strip joint, the kick is not just in watching Farley disintegrate into a wild man, it's in watching him struggle against his natural impulse. It's in knowing this character better than he knows himself. Farley plays Haru, who hopes someday to become the Great White Ninja prophesied in the sacred scrolls. Hired by a mystery woman (Nicollette Sheridan) to spy on her boyfriend, he pursues the case all the way to Beverly Hills, where he leaves his shoes outside his posh hotel every day -- only to have the maintenance man dispose of them. Beverly Hills Ninja is a silly movie, with silly jokes and a silly story. But the talents at work in it are not silly. The picture has, at worst, a 10-minute sag in the middle. But the rest of it is a pleasure. Not the least pleasure is in seeing a comedian come into his own. Watching Farley here, I found myself looking forward to his pratfalls, the way one might look forward to, say, the sight of Fred Astaire picking himself up, dusting himself off and starting all over again. Perhaps it's too early to start taking Farley really seriously. But he's too good, too funny and too in control of his out-of-controlness to be a mere buffoon. ",1
"BLACK KNIGHT: Comedy. Starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Gil Junger. (PG- 13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) He plays a 21st century man working in a medieval theme park who finds himself suddenly catapulted back to the year 1328. Fortunately, he ends up in England, so he can speak the language. The bad news is that he arrives just in time to get involved in a rebellion against an evil king. The screenplay (by Darryl J. Quarles and Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow) -- with its echoes of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court - - plays out in a variety of classically comic ways. At first, it's a farce. Jamal (Lawrence) has no idea that he's not in a theme park in modern-day Los Angeles, so when he talks to people he assumes one reality, while they make incorrect assumptions about his identity. No one but the audience is privy to the truth. When he meets a wandering, drunken knight in the woods, he assumes the man is a street person and advises, Get yourself some food stamps. When he meets an attractive lady-in-waiting and asks for a pen so he can write down her number, he's confused that she's impressed that he can read and write. Who you been dating? he asks. At one point, he mentions that he's from Normandie Street in South Central Los Angeles, and the king and the court assume he's a Moor from Normandy. Black Knight moves deftly and effortlessly from farce into fish-out-out- of-water comedy, where the kick comes from watching the comedian react to the strangeness and inconvenience of medieval life. This is where Lawrence's comic skill comes in: His reactions are so satisfying and extreme that we look forward to what he'll do when he sees his first medieval bathroom, for instance (a hole in the floor), or attends his first public execution. Lawrence makes look easy what is actually difficult. He expends enormous energy moment after moment and never lets up. He works his face and his body for maximum laughs, always staying alert -- and yet doing it all in such a way that it's not nerve-racking to watch him. He brings a degree of commitment that's not especially noticeable, but the results are unmistakable -- a movie that has comic vigor from beginning to end. Lawrence is funny when he's smirky and confident (for no good reason) and funny when he's panicking (for good reason). The scene in which he has to ride a horse, something he has never done, is flat-out slapstick and works. Even better is the set piece in which the king forces this Moor from Normandy to dance for the court. Knowing that his dance is bombing, Jamal (Lawrence) rescues himself by quickly instructing the court musicians in syncopation, teaching them rhythms that would not come into popular use for six more centuries. The resulting number -- to Sylvester Stewart's (that is, Sly Stone's) Dance to the Music -- is a delight. Black Knight has enough story to serve as a conveyor belt for gags and not so much as to get in the way. Lawrence has a strong moment, both amusing and truthful, when the king orders a man executed for stealing a turnip. Lawrence laughs out loud and keeps laughing, until gradually he realizes the king is actually serious. He's killing people for vegetables, he says incredulously. Lawrence gets adequate support from Tom Wilkinson as Knolte, the drunken knight, and from Marsha Thomason in the typical and mostly decorative role as the lady-in-waiting. But this is Lawrence's show, his chance to demonstrate his comic nimbleness and appeal. He runs with it. ",1
"BLADE: Action thriller. Starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff. Directed by Stephen Norrington. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet don't dismiss Blade as a typical thriller or as some kind of inflated style piece -- there's more than that going on. Big as it is, Blade is meticulous and subtle, not just in its camera technique but in the way it works its themes and creates a mood. I love the way director Stephen Norrington uses odd little one- and two-second shots. Sometimes he does it to convey information. For example, he suggests that a woman might be turning into a vampire by giving us a split-second, overexposed shot of the street as seen through her eyes. Are her eyes getting sensitive to bright light, by any chance? Other times Norrington will throw in a shot for no reason except that it has a subconscious rightness. A brief flash of a young blond vampire baring her teeth ends one sequence. The shot is sexy, scary and weird, and it comes out of nowhere. Blade feels of a piece. It feels like the director was in tune with the material and knew what he was doing. The main thing Norrington was doing was making nice, fat, industrial-sized pop entertainment, and he compromises nothing on that score. Blade, which opens today, is based on the Marvel Comics series. It's about a stalker of vampires (Snipes) who has some vampire blood himself, which gives him special powers. Vampires can run faster and jump higher, but their most interesting quality is their eyesight. Like a bird, they're capable of processing visual information faster than we can. That's why, when the film shows things through a vampire's eyes, everything is speeded up and has a throbbing strobe effect. But when we see humans through the eyes of a vampire, they seem to be going in slow motion. As Blade, Snipes looks great. What an outfit: black leather coat, leather vest, black sunglasses, Grace Jones hairstyle. Like Jean-Claude Van Damme, this is one action hero who is not going to let a life-and-death struggle with the forces of evil get in the way of his weekly salon appointments. I admire that. Blade isn't feeling good, though. In addition to the physical complications having to do with vampire blood, he's emotionally screwed up. As an infant, he lost his mother to a vampire. The search for Mommy is an underlying motif and informs his relationship with Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a gorgeous hematologist he has to protect. Stephen Dorff (Blood and Wine, City of Industry), who is getting very good at playing smirky young villains, is Deacon Frost, an up-and- coming vampire. In the world of Blade, vampires are a powerful, unseen influence on every aspect of human society. Too flamboyant to hide in the shadows, Frost wants to dominate humans. The picture sets up a conflict between pure-blood establishment vampires and the decadent breed of youngsters who just want to pillage and have fun. While Blade is on a metaphorical search for Mom, Frost is out to kill Daddy. The production design and cinematography -- beautiful sets, beautifully lit -- are worth special attention. In the board room where the top vampires meet, everything is dark blue and shadowy, the faces pale and bluish. Everyone looks as if he could use a good meal.  .. ",1
"BOYS ON THE SIDE: Comedy/drama. Starring Whoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker, Drew Barrymore. Directed by Herbert Ross. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture takes the form of a buddy comedy and uses it to introduce elements that, in another context, would be considered controversial. For one thing, it contains what is probably the most respectful treatment of  a lesbian character ever in a mainstream Hollywood film. Boys on the Side is a film about sex, AIDS and love between women -- romantic and otherwise. Yet there is nothing especially hip about the film's sensibility. It's just wonderfully humane. Everyone is treated with respect, and that includes conservative middle-aged mothers and even that much-maligned '60s singing duo, the Carpenters. The trailer and the advertising campaign, not to mention the presence of Whoopi Gold berg, would lead you to expect a rowdy comedy. Boys on the Side is that, but only for a while and only to an extent. It goes much deeper. These depths are not immediately obvious. For the first 10 minutes the picture is very much in the style of Goldberg's early comedies, with Goldberg playing it harsh and coarse as Jane, an unsuccessful club singer in New York. Wanting to get to Los Angeles in a hurry, she answers an ad looking for someone to share driving duties and meets Robin, who is her complete opposite: prim, friendly and very white-bread. If you know this kind of movie, you know that by the end of the picture these two opposites have to become friends. But at this point you'd never expect that you're seeing the be  ginning of a kind of love story. Rounding out the trio is Drew Barrymore, who, with her yellow hair, baby face and brassy warmth, is about the closest thing to Jean Harlow since Jean Harlow. With fine comic finesse she plays Holly, a free spirit who joins the cross-country trip following a brawl with her drug-dealing boyfriend. As a film about women, Boys on the Side feels as authentic as Thelma and Louise, so it comes as a surprise to find that it was written and directed by men. But these are good men: screen writer Don Roos (Single White Female, Love Field) and Herbert Ross, who has made several films revolving around women characters, including The Turning Point and Steel Magnolias. Ross is completely in control of the pace, plowing through the obligatory plot points, then taking time to linger over quieter moments of revelation. Even before we know that Robin has AIDS -- and we know very early -- we can tell from the extra edge in Mary- Louise Parker's performance that Robin is on a more significant journey than is immediately apparent. The picture has a strong impact almost from the beginning. In Tucson, where circumstances force them to settle, the women fall in with a friendly, hard-drinking crowd. The atmosphere is carefree, but the emotions are bittersweet. Scenes ache with longing. Robin longs for good health and misses sex and being touched. And Jane longs for Robin. No apologies are made for Jane, whose feelings for Robin are treated as no more or less right than anyone's feelings for anybody. The film's loveliest moment is the one in which Jane, having earlier made fun of Robin for liking the Carpenters, accompanies herself on piano to the Carpenters' song Superstar. She sings it quietly, at night, thinking she's alone, and we understand that this is more than just a confession of love -- it's an expression of willingness to open herself completely to this other woman's sensibility. Goldberg and Parker are extraordinary. I have always suspected Parker to be an exceptional actress, but after Boys on the Side I can say it loud and look people straight in the eye. With Goldberg, I have to admit to having had a blind spot regarding her as a dramatic actress. But if I ever had doubts, they've been erased in Boys on the Side. Her performance is so full, invested and heartfelt that there is never any doubt that Jane is completely in love, and that only her dignity and a middle-aged understanding of the world are keeping her from spilling over. Boys on the Side is almost a great film. Its one flaw occurs when the film concocts a fake conflict between the women in an attempt to add some drama. The plot device doesn't do great damage, but it is enough to keep the film from being a hands-down four-star movie. Then again it's just as possible that in time, when the trailblazing nature of this film is fully assessed, this flaw will seem minor indeed. ",1
"Baadasssss!: Drama. Starring Mario Van Peebles and Rainn Wilson. Directed by Mario Van Peebles. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) His struggle, which was epic, makes for an entertaining movie. But arguably the film's most irresistible virtue is that it's psychologically compelling, as well, with Mario Van Peebles starring as his own father, in a portrait not entirely flattering. Think of it as Sweet Sweet Mario's Baadasssss Revenge. Sons go through their early lives studying their fathers, attentive to every fluctuation of mood, but few sons ever get a chance to put those years of study to use. Mario Van Peebles deserves credit for directing, co-writing and casting himself into a dream situation, in which he gets to mimic the old man, show him what a bullying jerk he was and settle old scores, while under cover of doing a tribute film. If all sons got to do that, therapists would be out of business. Based on a memoir by the elder Van Peebles, it tells the story behind Melvin's landmark independent film, from conception through distribution. As presented in Baadasssss! Melvin is a man with lots of anger, but also lots of guts and integrity. At the start of the film, he has just completed the comedy Watermelon Man, and he has a three-picture deal with a major studio. His agent and the studio executives expect another comedy out of him, but he wants to do something more ambitious. He doesn't know what exactly, just something that hasn't been done before, that captures the truth and vitality of the black experience. Everything is coming together in Melvin, all the crosscurrents of politics and culture meeting up with one man's disposition and life history. This is his time, a singular moment in which he just knows that anything he says is going to be true and right and well-received, so long as he's honest. The movie shows Melvin riding a motorcycle with the young Mario (Khleo Thomas) and stopping on the road to lie down by a tree and think. Melvin is so plugged in that all he has to do is stop for 10 minutes, and he gets the idea for which he'll be remembered. For the rest of his life he might stop to rest by trees and come up empty. But now he's in the zone. The double excitement of a talent taking wing and of a man possessed with the determination to express his vision is contrasted with the indifference or downright opposition that greets his attempts at every point in his film's development. To delineate the setbacks would give away too much of the story. Suffice it to say, it soon gets to the point that whenever someone says, Melvin, we need to talk, the audience feels a sympathetic dread. To watch Baadasssss! is not just to be amazed that Melvin made the film, or that it turned out well and that people saw it. It's to be surprised that he even bothered to start filming. Baadasssss! shows him facing disaster before he has even exposed a single frame. As Mario Van Peebles well knows, a nice guy could not have made Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, only a fighter, preferably a street fighter. Yet, a generation later, Mario seems to be asking, was there really a need for Melvin to be such a hard case with his children? In an uneasy moment, Melvin forces the young Mario to replicate, in Sweetback, his own grotesque experience of losing his virginity to a prostitute years before. Baadasssss! is the portrait of a visionary with a blind spot, a man starved for kindness who can no longer recognize the responsibility to be kind, even to his kids. But it's a portrait of a visionary nonetheless. -- Advisory: Strong language, violence, nudity and sexual situations. ",1
"Back in the golden age of the big movie studios, Dawson City, a small town in Canada’s Yukon, was the last stop for movies in distribution. After playing in one of the city’s theaters, the prints had nowhere else to go. The studios didn’t want old prints back and wouldn’t pay the return postage. So the various theaters stored them, or destroyed them, or, in one of the more interesting cases, buried them.“Dawson City: Frozen Time,” a documentary by Bill Morrison that opens Friday, July 14, at the Roxie Theatre, tells of the 1978 discovery of an enormous cache of silent films, found when construction workers were bulldozing the foundation for a new building. Though the people who’d buried those film reels thought they were discarding them, they were actually preserving them — and much better than had they put them in a crate and saved them in a library. Underground, nitrate film stock ages at a slower rate; thus, many of the reels found were one-of-a-kind samples from otherwise lost movies.Dawson City has another source of historical significance. It blossomed into being during the first Klondike Gold Rush and solidified as a town during a second gold rush. Though it never became much bigger than a small town, it featured significantly in the lives of many prominent people. Dawson — the town, not the discovery — is also a focus of Morrison’s documentary, and the town’s history takes up the bulk of the screen time.Morrison’s approach is unusual and compelling. After opening the story with the 1978 discovery, he goes back to the 1890s and uses still photos and film to illustrate Dawson’s story from its earliest days. The footage comes from a variety of sources, though much of it derives from what was unearthed in 1978. These are snippets from feature films, which Morrison uses to emphasize and dramatize various turns in the story. There is no spoken narration. In place of narration is text that appears on screen, providing needed context for the pictures presented. Music, by Alex Somers, underscores this and becomes an essential part of the film’s effectiveness. After all, “Dawson City: Frozen Time” tells a rambling story. We think we’re watching something about film preservation, and then all of a sudden we’re watching something about the forming of a town. But the music links it all together, creating the sense of some overarching, unseen logic connecting all human activity and making everything inevitable.It’s that last impression that elevates “Dawson City: Frozen Time” to the level of poetry. The story of the town is interesting, without being scintillating. The discovery was significant, but not overwhelmingly transformative. But the feeling that Morrison and Somers are able to fabricate, from assembling these words, sounds and images, is worthy and original, and carries with it a philosophical quality. We come away with a contemplative suspicion that we’re all participating in something, and even if we don’t ever get to see the big picture, there probably is one, and it might even make sense. ",1
"Back in the studio days, Eddie Mannix was an executive at MGM and a famous mob-connected “fixer” for the stars. If a star needed an abortion — if a star got drunk and killed somebody with a car — Mannix would handle it. He’d suppress the scandal, work with the police and, if necessary, come up with an entirely false and palatable story for the newspapers. If he was your friend, he was your best friend, and if he was your enemy, you made sure your life insurance was paid up.Mannix (Josh Brolin) is at the center of “Hail, Caesar!” The loose riff on the studio era is set in the early 1950s. But the Mannix here is not really Mannix but a jumping-off point for a fun and sloppy Coen brothers lampoon that compresses real characters, reimagines others, and brings together some of the period’s many styles and currents. “Hail, Caesar!” can be enjoyed by anyone, but the more you know about the era’s movies, the more you’ll appreciate it.The studio here is Capitol Pictures, but it’s patterned on MGM, with Mannix taking orders from a Mr. Schenck out of New York (that is, Nicholas Schenck). When we first meet him, his studio is funneling lots of money into its latest biblical epic, “Hail, Caesar!” — a sort of combination of the real-life films “Ben-Hur” and “The Robe.” The Coens give us scenes from the film within the film, which capture both the magnificence and absurdity of filmmaking at this time. The magnificence was in the Technicolor camera work and the completely uncynical way in which stars were presented as glorious — such as when George Clooney, as a dim-witted actor playing a centurion, sits on a horse, framed against the sky. A more ironic take on the era comes when the centurion, in the desert, cuts through to the front of a line of slaves to get water — and then melts at the sight of Jesus, seen only from behind. Clooney is very funny, playing the scene with a completely unconvincing look of astonishment and transformation. What makes it funnier is that this is a stock scene that can be found, in one form another, in every biblical epic of the era. The Coens’ “Hail, Caesar!” is a flimsy construction that depends on a zany spirit and the charm of individual scenes to hold it together. There are times when this begins to feel like a dubious strategy, but each time, the movie rights itself. And if you keep your eyes open, there is always something to notice: Frances McDormand in a subtle tribute to MGM’s longtime editor, Margaret Booth, or a boardroom adorned with nothing but framed photos of Wallace Beery. In the biblical epic, you might also note the palm trees of a type that doesn’t grow in the Middle East.As the focus of most scenes, Brolin walks that distinct Coen brothers line between absurdity and realism, sarcasm and pathos. Somehow the Coens get to have it both ways, so that we see Mannix as a satirical figure and yet believe in his passion for the movie business. As the film star, Clooney has the fun of playing a frivolous, happy airhead in the offscreen scenes — a motormouth with nothing to say — and a screen idol in the film within a film. If he ever dreamed of being Kirk Douglas, here he gets his chance.One of the Coens’ most inspired, bizarre touches is to cast Tilda Swinton as rival gossip columnists, twins who hate each other. She’s quite funny — blithe and vindictive in one incarnation, insecure and vindictive in the other. And Ralph Fiennes enlivens a couple of scenes as a refined gay director trying to direct a cowboy actor in a drawing room comedy — the studio era described in a single sentence.",1
"Baghead: Comedy-drama. Starring Ross Partridge, Steve Zissis, Greta Gerwig and Elise Muller. Directed by Jay and Mark Duplass. (R. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The beauty of the Duplass brothers (The Puffy Chair) is that, on the surface, their movies seem as though the filmmakers are just stumbling around, extemporizing and being loose and lazy, just like the characters they depict onscreen. In fact, their movies are tightly structured, and these guys always know what they're saying, why they're saying it, and where their movie is going. Their approach rewards both casual and attentive viewers. If you just want to let the movie wash over you, Baghead, their latest, is an amusing bauble, about four youngish (but not that young) adults who go to a country cabin and, lo and behold, start being menaced by someone outside the cabin wearing a paper bag. But keep your eyes open, and there are lots of other, subtler things going on. For one thing, pay attention to the precision with which the characters and their emotional needs, delusions and self-images are delineated. The movie tells the story of Matt (Ross Partridge), a would-be actor and filmmaker in his late 30s, whose career just isn't happening. He attends the premiere of a low-budget film and gets the idea that he and some friends should go up to a cabin, that night, and spend two days writing a movie for themselves.  Anyone not paying attention could easily confuse the laid-back style of Baghead with its overall design. The camera work is casual, the people are casual and scenes are allowed to play out, languorously, with lots of dialogue. But Matt is terrified of failure. Chad (Steve Zissis) is in love with Michelle (Greta Gerwig) - slavishly, longingly, miserably - and she's too kind (or manipulative, or naive) to come out and say she's not interested. And Catherine (Elise Muller) is kidding herself that her on-again, off-again relationship with Matt isn't really off for good.  The Duplass brothers won't hit the audience over the head, but three of the characters are desperate - too old to be living like people in their 20s - while the youngest, Michelle, is confused, and could very well be an alcoholic in the making. Thus, the most easy conversations are accented ever so subtly by the characters' life terrors, which are real enough even before the baghead starts showing up.  The baghead could be one of a number of things, a criminal, something supernatural, something the protagonists are causing or something they're doing to each other as a prank. The good news is that, by the finish, the Duplasses aren't playing games. Like The Puffy Chair, Baghead gets somewhere.  Actually, it goes to a number of places. In 82 minutes, Baghead is a relationship comedy and a horror movie. It explores themes of success and sacrifice. It portrays people whose vulnerabilities are more obvious than they suspect. It portrays a way of life in which people extend their adolescences to the point that they themselves feel the strain. And, in the end, the movie puts it all together, with economy and intelligence, as well as with a deep sensitivity for the subtle, painful nuances of human interaction.  Make no mistake, the Duplass brothers are seriously talented, and they're doing stuff with movies that is new.-- Advisory:Strong language, violence, nudity and sexual situations.",1
"Batman Begins: Action drama. Starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes and Liam Neeson. Directed by Christopher Nolan. (PG-13. 141 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Batman Begins does it right, and it's the first Batman movie to get it right since Tim Burton's Batman, 16 years ago. Like the first Batman it has a dark spirit and an intellectually viable leading man -- Christian Bale, in this case. Unlike the first Batman, it's not a masterpiece of set design, and it doesn't have a flamboyant villain. Those elements were virtues of the original film, but they became pernicious as a prototype, when subsequent Batman movies tried to top the first in terms of both visuals and flouncing, raving villainy. Batman Begins goes in another direction, telling the story as neither a comic book in motion nor as a wild fable, but as the true story of a man who has a series of odd, transformative experiences. Directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) and written by Nolan and David S. Goyer, the film adopts an elegant narrative strategy, flashing back from Bruce Wayne's opening circumstances -- as an inmate in an Asian prison -- to his childhood. We find out that as a boy, Bruce was terrified of bats. In fact, his inability to sit still for a performance of Die Fledermaus causes his parents to leave the opera early -- which puts them on the street at exactly the wrong time. They're murdered in a holdup, an event that sets up young Bruce (Gus Lewis) for years of anguish, rage, guilt and soul-searching. Bale is the first Batman since Michael Keaton to bring a skewed and somewhat vulnerable sensibility into the psychological equation. Bruce's ultimate decision to become the caped crusader is presented here as a neurotic person's way of channeling his neurosis toward a positive end. Since he knows he'll never stop obsessing about crime -- even his stint in the Asian prison was by way of researching the criminal mind -- he might as well do something positive with his obsession. Keaton suggested these qualities and motivations, as well, but what Bale has that Keaton didn't is a physicality that also makes sense of all the action hero elements. In an early scene, Bruce Wayne beats up a half dozen guys in a prison yard. In terms of direction, it's one of the worst scenes: Nolan, as if uncomfortable shooting a conventional action number, relies on the modern cliches of constant intercutting and of filming so close to the action that it's impossible to see what's going on. But the sequence nonetheless demonstrates that Bale, the most cerebral Bruce Wayne since Keaton, is the most lithe to date. He's physically loose and graceful and looks like what Bruce Wayne pretends to be, a handsome playboy. Batman Begins lives up to its title, concentrating mainly on the hero's pre-history. He's trained like a Ninja by a great teacher (Liam Neeson). Later, in a crime-ridden, economically depressed Gotham City, he encounters none of the familiar villains, such as the Joker, the Riddler or Catwoman. They're in the future. The villains who turn up in this early era are normal in appearance, at least by Batman standards. Tom Wilkinson plays an Italian mob boss, and he's like any other mob boss, full of threats and resentment, while Cillian Murphy is a perverse psychiatrist, on the mob payroll. On the side of good is Gary Oldman, as a gruff, honest cop, and an assistant D.A. played by Katie Holmes, who, alone among the actors, doesn't quite seem comfortable in her role. The special effects are easy to take for granted, but they're first rate. Batman does a lot of cape gliding in this one. He relies on pulleys to shoot up the side of buildings and, in one notable case, to scoop someone off the ground for a private interview, 10 stories up. There's no doubting any of this. It's all obviously real. The action sequences are genuinely gripping. Even the chases are amusing. But best of all, there's just the pleasure of seeing something that's both fantastic to the eye and emotionally dimensional. This is how to make action movies. Of course, now that Batman has begun, the Batman movies will never end, at least not for another 10 years. But maybe this time around they won't get so awful. -- Advisory: This film contains gun violence and intense physical combat. ",1
"Be Cool: Action comedy. Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and VinceVaughn. Directed by F. Gary Gray. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Based on the novel by Elmore Leonard, the sequel picks up Chili's story 10 years later. Chili is still unflappable, still has a killer stare, and still has a way of making ridiculously sensitive insights into people that fill them with awe at his perceptiveness. On a Los Angeles street, he witnesses the gangland-style murder of a record producer (James Woods) and soon gets the idea to get into the music business himself. Be Cool is Leonard's music industry satire, and like his satire of the picture business in Get Shorty, it doesn't cut too deep, but it's amusing. Things get moving when Chili goes into a nightclub and sees a talented young singer named Linda Moon performing as part of a trio. When he talks to her and finds out that she's tied by a long-term contract to a parasitical manager (Harvey Keitel), his witless assistant (Vince Vaughn) and a gay henchman (The Rock), Chili decides on the spot to manage the girl himself. In a story that carts on a host of flamboyant characters, all doing extreme things, Linda is an important role, the movie's fixed center around which everything swirls. Her talent is the one thing everyone can recognize and everyone can value -- including the audience, thanks to Christina Milian's fine singing and her aura of self-assurance. She seems like a star in the making. Be Cool reunites the Pulp Fiction team of Travolta and Uma Thurman, who plays the owner of a floundering record label. They have a nice ease with each other, and it's good to see Thurman smiling again, after all that brutal combat in the Kill Bill movies. Just as Pulp Fiction referenced Saturday Night Fever, by having Travolta return to the dance floor, the makers of Be Cool can't resist referencing Pulp Fiction, by having Thurman and Travolta dance together again. But the scene just lies there, and it's unlikely that another movie will ever reference the dance in Be Cool. Let's hope. Yet it's a curious thing: F. Gary Gray has two seemingly can't-miss musical set-pieces in Be Cool, and he blows both of them. In the case of the Thurman-Travolta dance, he has Travolta in black and Thurman in white, on a dark dance floor, so we can't see Travolta, who is really the one the audience wants to look at. Later, Chili gets his protege a duet with Steven Tyler at an Aerosmith concert. The duet is intended to be the occasion by which Linda's innate superstardom is revealed. But Tyler hogs the vocals, and when they sing together, the mix favors Tyler, not Milian. It's supposed to be her moment, but instead she's just standing there. Gray has better luck getting the comedy over. The story is an appealing mess about the competing interests of Chili, the producer played by Keitel, a posse of gangsta rappers headed by a rival producer (Cedric the Entertainer) and, of course, the Russian mafia -- can't leave them out. The characters are colorful, if sometimes forced: The gay bodyguard, who dreams of becoming an actor, is a little too silly to be true, but The Rock finds some laughs there. The late Robert Pastorelli, who died shortly after filming, brings an uncompromised bitterness to his role as a hit man. He is so nasty and sour that he becomes quite funny. Travolta's natural air of inner peace, goodwill and total mischief -- not the usual combination -- make him an ideal Chili. The role calls from him many of the things audiences like about Travolta. He might want to re- think the smoking, however, next time he has to play a cool guy. Travolta is now at the age where we don't look at Chili and think the smoking is cool. Rather, we worry a little about his health. -- Advisory: Gangland violence, presented as a joke. ",1
"Bewitched: Comedy. Starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. Directed by Nora Ephron. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Comedy doesn't come by accident. The sheer skill involved in making Bewitched is worth standing back to appreciate, not in the way we might appreciate a Michelangelo sculpture, but in the way we might an exceptionally functional and sturdy dining room table. It's just pleasant to sit at. Screenwriters Ephron and her sister Delia are able to get laughs and make character points even in the moments of laying out a fairly involved exposition, and that's no small thing. That's skilled craftsmanship. One adjustment must be made from the beginning of Bewitched: There is no Samantha. But then, there couldn't be, because there's no Elizabeth Montgomery. Instead, Nicole Kidman plays Isabel, a witch who longs to experience life as non-magical human beings experience it. Unlike Samantha, she has led a sheltered existence and doesn't know the ways of mortals. Isabel is a complete innocent. That's a shrewd innovation in that it makes use of Kidman's comic gifts and doubles the number of funny characters in the movie. There's no Darrin, either. Will Ferrell plays Jack Wyatt, who's a bigger idiot than Darrin and not as nice a guy. A self-centered has-been whose film career is in decline, Jack agrees to star in a TV remake of Bewitched, but only if an unknown is cast as his co-star. He discovers Isabel and insists that the network hire her, figuring he can walk all over her. But one can't walk all over a witch for too long. The Ephrons have no interest in what might be called the more serious themes of the Bewitched sitcom. Samantha's sacrifice of immortality for love has no analogue in the movie. Nor is there any equivalent of Samantha's considered decision to give up magic for a life of suburban domesticity. On two occasions, the movie indulges in something that would have been considered cheap by the standards of the TV show: It has Isabel turning back time. Perhaps they did it on the sitcom, too -- I'm no expert -- but it's a dangerous element to introduce, because it means nothing is unsolvable, and therefore nothing matters. Instead, the Ephrons' take a narrow and not particularly ambitious approach to the material, turning Bewitched into an occasion for showbiz satire. But they make the most of their choices, and they give the movie velocity and a sense of fun. Jack, feeling insecure, overcompensates with demanding antics on the set: Make me 20 cappuccinos and bring me the best one!  Scenes of Jack playing Darrin give Ferrell a chance to get laughs by doing bad comic acting. He's very funny. Meanwhile, Isabel, having her first encounter with people, becomes disillusioned by humanity. She doesn't realize that she's seeing examples of humanity that would disillusion anybody. TV actors. Kidman's talent as a dramatic actress is beyond question, but it's only in her comedies that we see her mad streak. Here, playing an innocent set loose in the human world, Kidman creates a well-meaning character who never stops watching and guessing. The spectacle of Isabel's half-formed thoughts and false conclusions as they register on Kidman's face is often priceless and so are the moments when Isabel abandons herself to some notion of normal human behavior, which turns out to be ridiculously off. There's something pure, specific and full about Kidman's comic acting. In one scene, Isabel puts a love spell on Jack, goes on a date with him and becomes charmed by his attentions, even though she knows it's only a spell. Without Kidman's ability to convey innocence and without the clarity of her moment-to-moment being on screen, that scene wouldn't have been funny. It might have been pointless and confusing. Ephron spreads out the laughs, giving good moments and personalities to the secondary characters, not just to Michael Caine as Isabel's dad and Shirley MacLaine as the actress who plays Endora, but to Heather Burns as an acerbic TV staff person with an outsized disdain for Jack. The film does sag a bit near the finish, particularly when the character of Uncle Arthur (Steve Carell), formerly played by Paul Lynde, makes an extended appearance. But that's the only point in Bewitched that feels unassured, and the movie recovers. -- Advisory: There are some drug and sex references. ",1
"Black comedy. Starring Stephen Barker Turner, Heather Gordon and Daphne Zuniga. Directed by Amy Glazer. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Anyone who regularly goes to the theater in the Bay Area will recognize the names and faces involved in Seducing Charlie Barker. It was directed by Amy Glazer, who, until now, has primarily been a stage director. And it features familiar Bay Area actors such as Stephen Barker Turner, Liam Vincent and Alex Moggridge. Heather Gordon, who plays a vapid and destructive temptress, was Miss Marin County in 2008. So this is a movie made by people who don't usually make movies. The surprise is not merely how good Seducing Charlie Barker is - after all, that can happen - but how precise it is. Everything about this movie feels right, from its sardonic score to its assured camera work and cutting. The most impressive thing is its very specific and individual tone, which, unless you're doing a sitcom or a straight drama, is the hardest thing to maintain from shot to shot and moment to moment. This tone can be described as one of becalmed horror. Written by Theresa Rebeck, based on her play, The Scene, it deals with the dilemma of a good actor, approaching early middle age, who is not getting quality projects and finds himself obliged to compete for TV work that he considers to be beneath him. It's in this jaundiced frame of mind that Charlie (Turner) makes a very bad choice: He betrays his very nice wife (Daphne Zuniga) and starts an affair with Clea, a beautiful, confident, loquacious young woman, who is also a completely toxic imbecile. As is often the case with many burgeoning screen talents, Turner, in his first starring role, has a lived-in quality, as though he has been starring in movies for years. He has a demanding role, physically and psychologically, essentially a comic rendering of a man's disintegration. But Turner never hits a false note and never leaves the audience in doubt of the one quality that redeems Charlie in our eyes, which is his talent. If he were a bad actor, he wouldn't be going through such hell. In a different but equally effective way, Gordon is a revelation. An attractive actress, she triumphs in the role by serving the story and making herself repellent - and without once winking to the audience that it's all a joke and meant in fun. She really gets the audience dreading her. The performance indicates a native instinct, taste and technical facility that will serve her in the future. But it probably also points to Glazer's secure directorial hand guiding the proceedings. There are movies being made by people who have no business making movies. Seducing Charlie Barker is a movie made by people who haven't been making movies, but should be. As in, often. As in, from now on.",1
"Broken Flowers: Comedy-drama. Starring Bill Murray, Jeffrey Wright, Sharon Stone, Tilda Swinton and Jessica Lange. Directed by Jim Jarmusch. (R. 105 minutes. At BayArea theaters.) The film stars Bill Murray, the American cinema's darkest farceur since W. C. Fields, who has a face that by now just means something. Put him in close- up, and no matter what he's playing or saying, an underlying message is conveyed: This all really isn't much. Even being Bill Murray, even being a movie star, even this close-up, it's still a little depressing. Life is bigger than this. Time is passing. I look older than the last time you saw me. No kidding. So do you. What's to be done? The only thing to do is be polite about it and yet maintain some dignity, some private space around the self to ward off commotion and stay in touch with the truth. And not ignore it. That's it. The extent to which one respects Murray's acting is, to a large degree, the extent to which one believes he's actually communicating those things, rather than sleeping behind a deadpan expression and letting the audience work for him. To be sure, Broken Flowers features the most minimalist performance of a minimalist performer, and, at times, Murray plays it a little too close to the vest, especially when we compare him with his generous female co-stars here. But Murray can also do things other actors can't, and part of that ability is a consequence of his spare technique. A flicker of the eye, a tiny movement of the mouth, the vague hint of a smile and big emotions are conveyed. His command of his face on camera is something to marvel at. In Broken Flowers he plays Don, an aging lothario whose latest girlfriend (Julie Delpy) leaves him because he's too distant. The notion of Murray as a lothario is hard to buy, but the distant part makes intuitive sense. On the same day, he gets an anonymous letter on pink stationery from an old flame. The letter informs him that he has a 19-year-old son who has set out to find him. Don doesn't know who wrote the letter, or even if the letter is true, but at the encouragement of a neighbor (Jeffrey Wright), he provides the names of the women he was seeing 20 years before. His friend, an amateur sleuth, tracks down their addresses on the Internet and arranges for him to go on a trip. What follows is an odyssey in which he revisits the lives of his ex- girlfriends and picks up their various stories two decades later. The lives are different, but ordinary, not one of them the seeming culmination of some lofty, youthful hope. The acting challenge for all four actresses is to convey some kind of back story, of 20 years lived and of a previous history with the protagonist. No details are given. It's up to the actresses to invent it and then suggest it in their manner. As Laura, the most relaxed of the girlfriends, Sharon Stone is poised and arch, greeting Don as though he were a fellow scoundrel. Conversely, Jessica Lange suggests acres of pain and loss behind her lines, playing her role as someone who has been through the ringer and has worked on herself in some systematic way (Scientology? EST?) in order to overcome it. Frances Conroy plays her role -- a former hippie turned real estate agent -- as a woman who never really got over Don. Tilda Swinton shows fire in her brief scene, but it's a lightning appearance, just a couple of lines and she's gone. Don's search is Don's preoccupation. For Jarmusch, it's about the journey. As in Night on Earth, he manages to convey the sense that, even as life is going on here, it's going on simultaneously in other places, too -- it's rather like the fleeting spark of true objectivity that comes when traveling. The movie doesn't come to a definitive point or make an explicit, but the movie does illustrate, in a penetrating way, the sadness of going through life emotionally disconnected. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and full frontal nudity.

"CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: Comedy-drama. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The fun didn't get there by accident. Someone had to put it there, namely Steven Spielberg, who is finishing up a very good year indeed. Having cast off portentousness in The Minority Report, he casts off solemnity in Catch Me if You Can and gives us -- not his best movie -- but one of his smoothest and maybe his friendliest. The colorful cinematography, smart performances and brisk tempo suggest a filmmaker subordinating every other impulse to the task of manufacturing pleasure. Spielberg certainly does a job of resuscitation on Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was the boat that sank his talent, or so it has seemed given his lumpy performances recently. But Catch Me if You Can returns him to the crispness and invention that he showed as a kid. Maybe, like that other heartthrob Brad Pitt, he's just better in comedies. Or maybe playing the role of a kid just freed him up in some way. He plays Frank Abagnale Jr., a teenager who, in the mid-1960s, became a master at check fraud. Abagnale, upon whose autobiography the film is based, used his mastery to steal millions, and he also faked diplomas and identities. At different times, while still a teenager, he impersonated a Pan Am co-pilot and a lawyer, and he even got a job heading a hospital emergency room. We find all this out in the movie's first moments, as Abagnale (DiCaprio) is seen on the '60s game show To Tell the Truth. (Modern footage is intercut with Kitty Carlisle asking questions.) Spielberg has fun re-creating this and other aspects of mid-'60s America, from the vivid, geometric title sequence, to John Williams' Henry Mancini-like score to scenes of the Abagnale family watching Sing Along With Mitch -- and actually singing along. Cynicism would arrive later. Americans were more trusting then, and thus ripe for the machinations of a young hustler. Before he can get to the swindles, of course, Spielberg, the big softie, has to show why young Frank chooses crime and make us sympathize. And so in Catch Me If You Can check forging becomes just a young man's dramatic response to his parents' divorce. Spielberg allows us to buy this by lavishing time on young Frank's relationship with his father, who, like his son, is theatrical and has a touch of larceny. Christopher Walken plays dad with more than his usual mischief, with a warmth and vulnerability. Spielberg floods the frame with light in the moment just before Frank is told that his mother (Nathalie Baye) is divorcing his father. DiCaprio is filmed in full shot, under such brightness that his features are indistinct. It's a kind of transfiguration. Within minutes he will leave home and never come back. The specifics of the swindles are amusing but best left for viewers to discover on their own. Suffice it to say that Frank soon becomes an expert -- enough criminal to get an agent on his trail, Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks. With his white shirt and thin tie, glasses and short-rimmed hat, Hanks is made to look like the iconic '60s G-men from the collective American unconscious, the spitting image of the Secret Service agents who stood outside Parkland Hospital in 1963. The cat-and-mouse game, which takes place over several states and eventually crosses international borders, makes up most of the movie. While Frank dresses like that new movie hero James Bond and lives in luxury hotels, the long-suffering Carl works late hours and washes his clothes in the Laundromat. In one of the shrewdest scenes, the two men meet, but Frank is able to convince Carl that he's another agent on the case. The scene's a test, not just of Frank's persuasive power but of the actor's, and DiCaprio does splendidly, showing a confidence and charm he hasn't demonstrated in years. In its last third, the movie loses some of its momentum, as Spielberg shifts back and forth from Frank to Carl and explores the nature of their peculiar long-distance relationship. That's probably inevitable because Catch Me if You Can is as much about the participants as it is about the chase. Still, even when it all gets a bit too languorous and lengthy for what is essentially a romp, it's impossible to lose interest. ",1
"CHARLOTTE GRAY: Drama. Starring Cate Blanchett, Billy Crudup and Michael Gambon. Directed by Gillian Armstrong. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture tests our usual war-movie associations. We know what a German helmet looks like. We know anyone wearing it is a bad guy. But how about a French gendarme's cap, one of those round hats with the flat top? That's usually a good-guy hat, but in Charlotte Gray, those collaborators are just as menacing as the Gestapo. We see one of those gendarmes, in an early scene, arresting a woman for espionage. The gendarme is played by a very French-looking actor, with a strong nose and small, dark eyes -- the kind of fellow that, in another movie, might play a jolly shopkeeper or a chef. Here he's the face of death. It takes some getting used to. Charlotte Gray tells the story of a Scottish nurse who decides to use her fluency in French to become a British spy. Cate Blanchett has the title role, and she does wonders with it, bringing a degree of passion but also suggesting something essentially unevolved in Charlotte's character. She's brave and patriotic, but also ever-so-slightly off, as though disconnected in some way. But then, what normal woman would want to change her identity, parachute into enemy territory and start blowing up munitions trains? Charlotte is sent into Vichy France, the part of the country not physically occupied by the Germans but run by a French government under German control. This is an embarrassing part of French history, something that doesn't conform to our image of France as a nation of resistance fighters, wearing berets, eating loaves of bread and carrying rifles. Yet, if anything, Charlotte Gray shows the heroism of the resistance. They weren't just fighting the Germans. They were fighting their fellow citizens. They didn't know whom they could trust. That sense of unease is present from the second Charlotte sets foot on French soil. Everything looks quaint and rustic, but nothing is quite right. Any random French villager -- say a schoolteacher with a kindly face -- can be the most cynical and evil of collaborators. At least the Germans wear uniforms. Charlotte hooks up with Julien (Billy Crudup) and becomes one of a team of fighters. The striking thing about life as a spy in Charlotte Gray is the way the moments of peak tension and horror suddenly present themselves on days that are otherwise pedestrian. Julien and Charlotte go out and get into a gunbattle with German soldiers, then go home to the country house of his father (Michael Gambon). The next day, everything seems normal, but it's not. Better than just about any other film, Charlotte Gray captures the peculiar mental state of life during wartime. The characters go around in a paranoid funk that occasionally almost lifts, but never completely. This movie deserves no criticism for being morose and contemplative -- that's the mood that director Gillian Armstrong cultivates and captures. The characters do things they couldn't have imagined themselves doing in peacetime. At one point, Charlotte's British spy contact moans, This isn't me. In Charlotte Gray the war is so real it feels unreal. ,1 Charlotte's wartime haze is periodically pierced by moments of unexpected and powerful emotion, much of it surrounding two little Jewish boys that she and Julien are attempting to hide. There are scenes here, of a frantic Charlotte trying to lead the two boys to safety, that look like a World War II photograph come to life. Charlotte is another fine portrait for Blanchett's growing gallery. For the past few years, instead of doing the typical movie a year, she has been working constantly, building an impressive body of work, like a woman with something to prove. As Charlotte Gray shows, she's proving it. There is no better actress in films today. ",1
"CITIZEN RUTH: Satire. Starring Laura Dern, Mary Kay Place and Swoosie Kurtz. Directed by Alexander Payne.(R. 100 minutes. At the Lumiere.) The movie, which opens today at the Lumiere, is a satire that acknowledges the shortcomings in the abortion debate and lampoons the more fanatical elements. Along the way, this funny picture does exactly what a satire should: It irritates everybody. At least it runs that risk. Anti-abortioners are presented as Bible-thumping hypocrites, while pro-choice people are caricatured as knee-jerk, moon-worshipping airheads. Equally offensive to some will be the presentation of other anti-abortion folks as sweet and generous -- and of their pro-choice counterparts as sensible and down-to-earth. Citizen Ruth gets right in there. Co-written by first-time director Alexander Payne, this is a film that mucks around in some volatile territory and somehow comes out at the end of 100 minutes with its honesty and good nature intact. Laura Dern is center stage as Ruth, a young woman with noth ing going for her except the baby she's carrying. She's a thief, a low- life and a druggy with an incredibly unglamorous addiction: She sniffs hazardous substances. For her, the sight of a tube of airplane glue is irresistible. Give her a tube of blue paint and a paper bag, and she's in heaven. For a while, it seems as if Citizen Ruth might be coming from a snotty, elitist grad school point of view. After Ruth is arrested and a judge suggests she might consider an abortion, a group of small-town anti-abortion activists adopt Ruth as a cause. These religious, working class people are treated with the usual ironic condescension -- but this turns out to be the movie's attitude toward everyone and everything. Citizen Ruth looks on the abortion controversy from a dis tance and sees a circus. An anti- abortion Mom (Mary Kay Place) tries to be a mother to Ruth, and a pro-choice lesbian (Swoosie Kurtz) tries to be a sister to her, but neither one really cares about her. To the extent that the film is serious, it suggests that the reluctance of some activists on each side to admit the rationality and humanity of those in opposition creates an atmosphere which serves no one and in which nothing good can come. Kurtz and Place are subtle and droll as the older women figures in Ruth's life, and there are many funny turns by characters in smaller roles -- particularly Burt Reynolds, who has a featured part as the possible-pedophiliac anti-abortion leader. As Ruth, Dern is adequate, but she lacks a bottom note that might have made Ruth more absurd and horrifying. It's never quite possible to forget this is a wholesome, intelligent actress playing at being vile. Indeed, if social and political satires came out every month, it would be possible to greet Citizen Ruth with a much colder eye. But as it stands, intelligent satires are virtually nonexistent in Hollywood. For one to come along with guts is even more unexpected -- and welcome. ",1
"CITY BY THE SEA: Drama. Starring Robert De Niro, Frances McDormand and James Franco. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, who guided De Niro to a strong performance in This Boy's Life, the picture is about a New York detective, Vincent LaMarca, whose distinguished police career has been spent under a psychological cloud. His father was a murderer, executed in the electric chair. Vincent's professional life has been a kind of lifelong atonement, or, at least, a denial of a family stigma. But that's all turned upside down when his son kills a drug dealer in a knife fight. Based on a 1997 Esquire article, City by the Sea takes its inspiration from true events. There really is a Vincent LaMarca, a man who found himself at the center of a generational murder sandwich after an exemplary career in the New York Police Department. But everything else in the movie is dramatic embellishment. In real life, LaMarca was married and retired when his son committed the murder. Here he's divorced and fairly miserable, a working detective unwittingly investigating the murder his son committed. These dramatic flourishes change the nature of the story so much that it's surprising the character names weren't changed as well. But these changes work to support a consistent vision, from the lighting to the performances. City by the Sea is a dark movie about battles lost, about the inexorable movement from light to darkness, from ripeness to decay, from joy to disillusionment. Indeed, it's so bleak that it would play like a contrived neo-noir if it weren't so consistent, committed and obviously sincere. Vincent has watched his personal life slide into ruin, just as he's seen the home of his childhood, Long Beach, Long Island, go from a beach resort -- captured on countless Kodachrome home movies -- to a monochromatic wasteland of wrecked boardwalks and hypodermics in the sand. This is what happens in 40 years' time. How does it happen? Who knows? Maybe entropy, maybe neglect, maybe not enough people caring -- or maybe nothing could have made a difference. Like its hero, City by the Sea occupies an emotional zone between resignation and despair, which is a lot like regular resignation, only less relaxing. A body washes up in New York, and in the background loom the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The sight reinforces the sense of hopelessness. No wonder that LaMarca finds comfort in stasis. He has a cozy, go-nowhere sexual relationship with his downstairs neighbor (Frances McDormand). He has a job he won't quit, even though he's eligible for retirement. He's a man of routine. Routines are good; progress is bad. Progress is your son going from a smiling toddler to a crack addict. As Joey, Vincent's son, James Franco provides the movie's other powerhouse performance. His lying, his addiction, his anger -- it's all ugly. Even the way he moves his body is ugly. There's no pleading by Franco for audience understanding. He seems irredeemable. Too bad, then, that the movie softens up his crime (which takes place in the first minutes), transforming into a case of self-defense what had been, in real life, something more cold-blooded. City by the Sea is a movie about fathers and sons. It doesn't whitewash Vincent, and neither does it make him responsible. Rather, it presents him in ways that allow us to see his blind spots, his inner dead zones. It's as if half of his emotional nature has a curtain drawn over it, and his choice -- to live his life that way -- has had consequences. We see that realization growing in the eyes of his neighbor, ably played by McDormand. It's in the nature of such bottled-up characters that eventually the dam breaks. In some movies, that can be contrived, but in City by the Sea, when De Niro opens up -- trying with everything he has to stop the destruction -- no one in the audience breathes. This is real. De Niro has been showing us great stuff for 30 years now, but in this movie he shows us something new. . This film contains violence, strong language and sexual situations. ",1
"CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER: Thriller. Starring Harrison Ford and Willem Dafoe. Directed by Phillip Noyce. (PG-13. 135 minutes.) The world of Clear and Present Danger is a strange one in which people commit atrocities, though at such remove they never have to own up to their actions. Based on a novel by Tom Clancy, the film seems to have its pulse on some peculiarly modern varieties of madness. It's about the terror over the power of life and death -- but it's also about power's allure. There are double-crosses within double-crosses. Alliances shift with the wind. In fact, it's a marvel of the screenplay, in which Ford returns as CIA agent Jack Ryan, an action hero who would prefer less action. Phillip Noyce's direction and Neil Travis' editing are easy to fol  low. The plot alone is a thing of beauty. Beyond the details of plot -- about an illegal war against the Colombian drug cartels -- the film is an examination of an America committed to power, not principle, and how that moral failing translates into individual failings at the very heights of government. In this way Clear and Present Danger, now available on home video, will appeal to both liberals and conservatives, as well as to those who consider themselves neither, and know something stinks -- but can't decide which way the smell's coming from.

"Cadillac Records: Drama. Starring Adrien Brody, Jeffrey Wright and Beyoncé Knowles. Directed by Darnell Martin. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Cadillac Records didn't have to be nearly as good as it is. The story of the record label that introduced the world to Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and others could have leaned entirely on its music, and nobody would have minded. Instead, somebody bothered to make a real movie, and the result is a satisfying combination of great songs and strong dramatic performances.  The company was Chess Records, started in Chicago by a Polish immigrant named Leonard Chess, who from the 1940s through the late '60s used his label to discover and promote black talent. The musicians Chess recorded have exerted a tremendous influence on popular music ever since. Take Muddy Waters, who sounds a lot as if he's imitating the Rolling Stones - but 10 years before the Rolling Stones existed. The first hint that the movie means business comes in an early scene in which Waters, working on a plantation in the Deep South, encounters a man from the Library of Congress who is going around recording folk music. Waters accompanies himself on guitar, and the man plays the song back for him. When Waters hears himself, he's stunned. I feel like I met myself for the first time, he says. This is a profound moment in his life, and Jeffrey Wright, as Waters, invests it with the perfect mix of restraint, realization and awe.  Chess believes in the American dream in the way that only an immigrant can, and to him the physical embodiment of that dream is the Cadillac. When Chess moves out of poverty into early success, he buys himself one. Later, he starts giving Cadillacs as presents. Waters gets the first. Soon, harmonica player Little Walter (Columbus Short) and Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) are on the scene, followed a little later by Chuck Berry, who drives the best Cadillac of all. Writer-director Darnell Martin takes care to make every one of these people vivid and complicated. Short plays Little Walter at a fever pitch throughout, as a damaged and unbalanced hysteric who goes around carrying a gun. Howlin' Wolf has perhaps 20 lines in the whole movie, but they're enough for Walker to suggest a cryptic, menacing personality driven by a distinct code of ethics. And Mos Def, as Chuck Berry, captures the rock pioneer's wisecracking surface, and the shrewdness, rage and bitterness underlying it.  Yet it's Beyoncé Knowles as Etta James who's the movie's revelation. Going in, that seemed unlikely. Knowles looks about as much like Etta James as I do, and when you add in the fact that she executive-produced the movie, the casting sounds suspiciously like a vanity exercise, as a bid for credibility or a chance to play dress-up.  Well, forget that. She's great.  First of all, she has a terrific voice, and this is a movie in which all the actors do their own vocals. She has a gifted singer's capacity for reaching deep into her own emotions with ease, so she hits every song out of the park. What's more, she's a real actress, who brings out James in all her complex shadings - the scalding anger, the pain, the self-hatred, the unwillingness to trust anybody and the helplessness to control her own turbulence.  Knowles gives us a James who is almost a monster, but Chess sees something inside her, the vulnerability she tries to hide, and when James realizes he sees it, the two establish an unspoken connection that's really the loveliest thing in the movie. The reward is a miraculous little scene that Martin films in an extended, extreme close-up, just Knowles' and Brody's faces as they talk. Just beautiful.  A good general rule is that if one performance is good, credit the actor. But if everyone in the movie is doing excellent work, this is no coincidence. This is the product of superior direction. Martin made two low-budget films in the early '90s and has since worked in television. But feature films could use more directors who really know how to talk to actors, and Cadillac Records suggests that Martin is one of them. -- Advisory: Strong language, drug use, violence and simulated sex.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Callas Forever: Drama. Starring Fanny Ardant and Jeremy Irons. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli. (Not rated. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For Callas lovers, it doesn't get much better than this. The movie is rich with music and more than a few moments of painful exaltation, where the breath catches, the eyes fill and the skin tingles. You know, Callas moments. The story also gives Zeffirelli, one of the great opera directors, a chance to stage scenes from Carmen, with Callas -- or rather Fanny Ardant as Callas -- at its center. Yet a familiarity with Callas or opera in general is hardly required for appreciating this film. Though campy at times, Callas Forever is a generous offering, full of flamboyant characters and grand performances. The musical selections are deliberately chosen from the more accessible end of the Callas discography: Bizet, lots of Puccini, Casta Diva. For many, this will be the beginning of a beautiful acquaintance with one of the supreme interpretive artists of the 20th century. The movie takes place in 1977, several months before Callas unexpectedly died of a heart attack at 53. As in real life, Callas is living as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment, her career over, her voice a shadow of its former glory. Her friends are worried about her, but few can get near her. And then -- here's where the fiction begins -- a rescue, of sorts, arrives in the form of her old manager, Larry Kelly (Jeremy Irons), a gay impresario who specializes these days in promoting punk rockers. He has a brilliant idea: Yes, Maria's voice is shot, but she's still a great actress. So why not make a film using, as the soundtrack, an opera that she recorded in her heyday? After all, singers are never recorded live on a movie soundstage anyway. What difference does it make if the playback recording is from last month or 15 years ago? It's still her. Kelly's motive is not only money. He wants to help her. According to her housekeeper, she is spending her days taking pills and listening to her old recordings. In one scene, Larry looks through a crack in the door as Maria listens and acts out her 1955 recording of Un bel di, the famous second-act aria from Madame Butterfly. It's a stunning, heartrending spectacle. Ardant is an almost ideal Callas. She has the right height, look and intelligence. She has the sensitivity, and she finds the temperament by emphasizing Callas' insecurity. The only strike against her, and it can be overlooked, is her French accent. Callas, an American of Greek descent, had a distinct way of talking, a New York accent informed by Italianate sing-song rhythms and French-inflected diva affectation. Her humorlessness, which her speech conveyed, could be unintentionally comical. Fortunately, Ardant finds means to suggest that comic humorlessness in other ways, as when someone mentions her rival, Renata Tebaldi, and she flinches. The movie's weaknesses are peripheral. Zeffirelli is interested in Callas and the meaning of her life and art, and he's equally interested in staging a spectacular screen Carmen, which he does. Everything else is rendered in shorthand, so the story often seems ungrounded, almost fairy tale-like, but not quite. Joan Plowright, as a journalist friend of Callas', gets lost in the shuffle, but Irons as the impresario is lots of fun, sporting a ponytail and smoldering lasciviously at his young lover while maintaining at his core a reverence for art. To Zeffirelli, a Catholic, Callas was an instrument through which God poured out divine beauty. He believes this literally, and so this is the Callas he gives us: a woman blessed and cursed by a terrible gift that makes normal life meaningless, while giving her a glimpse into a transcendence that eludes her. There are other ways of presenting Callas, but this is an especially powerful one. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. ",1
"Carandiru: Drama. Starring Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos, Ailton Graça and Ivan de Almeida. Directed by Hector Babenco. (Not rated. 135 minutes. In Portuguese with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) Carandiru became notorious throughout Brazil in 1992 when riot police killed more than 100 inmates, many of them execution style. This tragedy led to the phasing out of the prison and its ultimate demolition in 2002. Based on the best-selling memoir by Drauzio Varela -- a physician who was also Babenco's oncologist during his bout with lymphoma in the 1990s -- Carandiru sensitively and effectively dramatizes events leading up to the 1992 bloodbath. One might expect a dreary, depressing film, and to an extent it is, but there are many flashes of lightness, not of humor so much as of simple human vividness, which keeps challenging us to see the prisoners as individuals, some of whom are quite colorful and sympathetic. In a series of flashbacks, various inmates tell a prison doctor (Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos) about how they ended up there. Mostly, these are interesting stories, and their telling allows Babenco to escape the prison walls for a few minutes and take us with him. It's a relief. Occasionally, Babenco (Kiss of the Spider Woman) pushes the sentiment too far, as in his corny treatment of a makeshift wedding between a colorful transsexual and her tiny boyfriend. The director is much better when he seems unfazed, as in his offhand presentation of the prison dynamic. In Carandiru, an inmate must go to an older prisoner named Ebony to get permission before being allowed to kill a fellow inmate. If any prisoner violates that house rule, the punishment is brutal -- brutal to the prisoner, and brutal to watch. The cast is first rate, headed by Ivan de Almeida, who brings wiliness and shrewd humor to Ebony, and Ailton Graça, as a high-status inmate called Highness. Graça looks a lot like Denzel Washington and shares with the American actor that appealing quality of contagious self-delight. -- Advisory: Blood, graphic violence and strong language. ",1
"Cassandra's Dream: Comedy-drama. Starring Ewan McGregor, Colin Farrell and Tom Wilkinson. Directed by Woody Allen. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Right now Woody Allen's most worrisome competitor is himself. Such is the price of being prolific and having one of the greatest bodies of work in film history. He can make a perfectly good movie like Cassandra's Dream and have it compared not to those of other filmmakers but to his own best work. And because Allen has a tendency to return to the same subject matter, those comparisons are too easy to resist. Allen seems to be going through a necessary murder phase these days. His past three films, Match Point, Scoop and now Cassandra's Dream, feature seemingly normal, civilized characters who, out of expediency - to avoid disgrace or difficulty - decide it's necessary to kill somebody. Such a character was also at the center of Allen's 1989 masterpiece, Crimes and Misdemeanors.  This recurring motif leaves us with a number of ways to view Allen's latest effort. We could take a college paper approach and look at Cassandra's Dream in terms of Allen's other necessary murder movies to see how it differs thematically and what it adds to the discussion. But that approach skirts the issue of whether the movie is any good. Or we could take a cynical approach and say, hey, this is his fourth movie about the same subject, and guess what? It's not as good as Match Point or Crimes and Misdemeanors, so who needs it?  But don't think of it that way. Instead, pretend never to have heard of Woody Allen and just watch Cassandra's Dream. Or better yet, make believe this is somebody else's first movie. Taken on its own, it's a fairly impressive piece, a directorially vigorous, well-acted, tightly constructed movie that effortlessly mixes comedy and drama while dealing with issues of morality and conscience. Along the way, almost by chance, it provides the best showcase yet for Colin Farrell.  Allen is working in England these days, and the change of location, which began with Match Point, still seems fresh. Two brothers, Terry (Farrell) and Ian (Ewan McGregor), from a cockney family are at the center of the story. Terry works in a garage fixing high-end automobiles and has a weakness for gambling. Ian runs a restaurant with his father, but he has big plans to go to California and get into real estate. The title derives from a boat the guys buy when Terry is flush with winnings. Life smiles at Ian for a while as well when he meets a sexy aspiring actress, Angela (Hayley Atwell), who is the usual matter-of-fact, cold-blooded, amoral Allen femme fatale. Ian is happy but not secure in his happiness. He needs to have the girlfriend believe that he's a big shot or that, at least, he's well on his way to becoming one. Tom Wilkinson has a key role as Uncle Howard, whose success and generosity are a family legend. Unlike Farrell and McGregor, who thrive in the Allen universe, Wilkinson seems uncomfortable, groping either for his lines or for the right improvisation. But he gets the job done: Howard introduces temptation, suggesting that the brothers' pressing need for money might be alleviated if they were to commit a certain terrible crime. Allen, whose modern style is to begin his movies with characters in midconversation, never wastes his audience's time. Everything that happens happens for a reason, and the story presses forward constantly. He has developed, over the years, a knack for suspense, and he creates tense scenes that an action director would envy. Yet his plot-driven approach doesn't shortchange his characters. The strongest moments in Cassandra's Dream are those in which characters wrestle with their consciences. Allen's return to familiar plot territory becomes an occasion for him to rethink ideas he's expressed in other films. In thematic terms, Cassandra's Dream could be looked at as a rebuttal to Crimes and Misdemeanors. In any case, Farrell stands out as the conscience-stricken Terry, who seems to retreat into an unreachable place inside. Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and yet somehow this worked wonders for Farrell, who has never seemed so naked, so clear and so unencumbered as he does here. -- Advisory: Adult themes, sexual situations, violence.",1
"Caterina in the Big City: Drama. Starring Alice Teghil and Sergio Castellitto.Directed by Paolo Virzì. (Not rated. 106 minutes. In Italian with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The film offers a microcosm of the political situation in Italy. In school, Caterina (the charming Alice Teghil) discovers two distinct cliques, each politically based. There are the left-wing kids, led by Margherita (Carolina Iaquaniello), a brooding hippie from an artistic family. And there are the right-wing kids, who are rich and fun-loving, led by Daniela, whose father is a honcho in the Berlusconi government. Caterina, who is sweet and passive and refreshingly normal, fits in with neither of these groups. Director and co-writer Paolo Virzì presents both cliques as unattractive and narrow-minded, though the right-wingers get the worst of it: They're not just eccentric and insular, but spiteful. But Virzì has a point to make beyond the obvious one, that Italy could use some middle ground politically. Caterina is also an exploration of class differences. In Caterina's school, the two cliques may consider themselves as antithetical, but the kids, conservative and liberal, are all rich and destined to become members of the ruling class. They're more like each other than Caterina is like them. This class aspect is emphasized in the presentation of Caterina's father, Giancarlo, played by Italian superstar Sergio Castellitto. Giancarlo wants to be a big shot. He sees himself as a great artist, though what little we hear of his novel sounds like silly pornography. He sees himself as an intellectual, and he longs for wealth and social acceptance. A lifetime of watching Americans would lead one to expect Giancarlo to be revealed as a lovable eccentric, with some sterling qualities under the rough exterior, especially as he's played by a major star. But Giancarlo is the kind of character we don't get in American movies: An idiot with deep longings, a fool with dreams, someone who hopes but has no hope, someone with social grievances that are almost legitimate, but not quite. In an American film, he would have to be good or bad, right or wrong, and if he was good, he'd have to succeed, because that's how we see life. But the Italians are more fatalistic. Giancarlo isn't going to succeed because he's an idiot -- period -- and it doesn't matter that he knows it and that it hurts really bad. That's just the way it is. Giancarlo's predicament is a grotesque one, but it brings out an effective character performance by Castellitto. -- Advisory: The film contains some drug use and strong (subtitled) language. ",1
"Catwoman: Fantasy thriller. Starring Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt and Sharon Stone.Directed by Pitof. PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's really a movie about women. So tonight a million men will drag their girlfriends to see Catwoman and will walk out saying, Wasn't that stupid? but the women will know: It's not. Rather, it's an odd, idiosyncratic movie -- dark in look and dark in spirit -- that plays as a kind of pop culture investigation into the meaning of feminism and the options open to women in the modern world. Both accidentally and intentionally, Catwoman captures and mythologizes enough strains of modern thinking that the temptation is not to even bother unraveling it. Just stick it in a time capsule and let them sort it out in a few decades. Halle Berry is Catwoman, of course, but first the movie has to show us how she got that way. She's Patience, a cat lover and commercial artist who designs print advertisements for a cosmetics company. Timid and retiring, she lives a solitary life in a crummy apartment with loud neighbors who blast music at 4 in the morning. She's a woman who plays by the rules and lives a life of vague but ever-present discontent. Patience is contrasted with Laurel (Sharon Stone), a supermodel whose many poses adorn the lobbies and corridors where Patience works. Laurel co- owns the cosmetics company with her husband, George (Lambert Wilson), and when we first meet them, George is announcing to the board of directors that Laurel, who has been the company's face for 15 years, is being replaced by a younger model. It's a good scene for Stone, who, as Laurel, maintains the illusion of high spirits while suggesting just enough suppressed rage to unsettle the whole room -- and the audience. The scene tells us everything we need to know about Laurel. She knows no rules. She goes through life smiling, and she's enraged. Catwoman has a dark elegance and stylish moves. In an early scene, the director -- who goes by the name of Pitof -- pans from a long shot of Wilson to pick up Stone in close-up. The shot doesn't mean anything; it just looks good. At times he gets carried away, filming a simple one-on-one basketball match between Patience and her hunky cop boyfriend (Benjamin Bratt) as a montage to musical accompaniment. Yet for the most part the look is just right, a mix of murkiness and glitz that supports the movie's weird tone: festive pessimism. Patience becomes Catwoman, or rather one of a long line of catwomen, when she is murdered and brought back to life by cats. They not only breathe life into her, but they also infuse her with their nature. And so Patience soon finds herself devouring sushi, sleeping on piles of cushions and climbing up and down the furniture. More significantly, she finds herself no longer inhibited by the laws of society. She has fierce independence and total confidence. She even has a leather outfit and fake cat ears. It's precisely here that the movie should derail, but it's just getting started. Written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who collaborated on the story with Theresa Rebeck, a Pulitzer finalist in drama, Catwoman celebrates female power but is conflicted in its ideals. It extols independence, confidence and rebelliousness, but these are qualities Catwoman also shares with Laurel, and Laurel is ruthless and evil. Is Laurel a heroine, too? The movie makes clear that Laurel is the victim of a husband who has lost interest in her, and the screenplay consistently gives her good lines. Without a doubt, the film has some ambivalence surrounding Laurel, but that's not flaw, but a virtue, reflecting a similar tension in the world outside the film. Catwoman and Laurel are bound to clash, and so inevitably we're presented with a contest between the two women -- both of them free, independent and unnatural. Catwoman is unnatural because she's practically supernatural, while Laurel is unnatural because a toxic face cream has given her skin like marble,  and she can't feel a thing. What a metaphor for plastic surgery, which turns the human face into an unfeeling mask. I think when the future weighs in on Catwoman, it will decide that its unintended message is that independence is great, so long as women don't take it too far. But in the meantime, there's Friday night, and for Friday night this will do just fine. It's definitely a good matchup -- Stone's cynical bravado versus Berry's resilient spunkiness in a world-class cat fight. -- Advisory: Sex banter and action-movie violence. ",1
"Charlie Wilson's War: Comedy-drama. Starring Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by Mike Nichols. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Charlie Wilson's War is a behind-the-scenes look into fairly recent history, involving real characters who are still alive and who did important things. Written by Aaron Sorkin, directed by Mike Nichols, and based on a true story, the film details the personalities and politics behind the U.S. government's covert aid to Afghan insurgents, who fought and - thanks to Stinger missiles and anti-tank guns - defeated the Soviet Union. This clever and enjoyable film centers on Charlie Wilson, a Democratic congressman from Texas whom we first meet snorting cocaine and soaking in a hot tub with strippers. Wilson, a bachelor, is a heavy drinker and a womanizer, but he's not a simple hedonist. A rogue but an honest one, he hides a serious streak underneath the good-time-Charlie exterior. In the beginning, that means telling the strippers to be quiet when something interesting comes on the news. Later his seriousness leads him into more committed territory, toward helping take down a totalitarian nightmare.  The role of Charlie Wilson demands something different from Tom Hanks, and he responds with among the best character work of his career. It's not his deepest or richest performance, far from it, but this film is the best argument yet for the notion that Hanks doesn't always have to play a version of himself. As Charlie, Hanks gets to be sexier, more wry, more shrewd and in some ways more funny than he has ever been before onscreen. He creates a complete portrait of a distinctly Southwestern type that we immediately recognize and like. Sorkin writes great scenes, and Charlie Wilson's War is about its script more than anything. Just as Wilson is introduced in the hot tub, Philip Seymour Hoffman also gets a big entrance as CIA agent Gust Avrakotos, telling off his boss and smashing the glass wall of his office. Avrakotos is a first-generation American, rough around the edges, who resents being passed over for promotion in favor of smoother white-bread types, and when we meet him he's raving about not getting a promised position in the Helsinki bureau after having bothered to learn Finnish (one of the most difficult languages in the world). For the last 24 years people have been trying to kill me, he says. People who know how. That extra knowing detail - in this case, the people who know how line - is what makes Sorkin's scenes pop. Throughout there's the sense of seeing and hearing power in action, and whether the film is accurate or not, it's convincing. Julia Roberts is Mrs. Herring, a Christian conservative who hosts an event at her Texas home publicizing the plight of the Afghans. Because she's rich and a major donor, Wilson has to attend. Because he's apparently irresistible, they end up in bed - and discuss how to increase the budget for covert operations as he soaks in the bath. Though everything in the movie flows as easily as water downhill, it's striking how much technical detail Sorkin includes while seemingly giving us a series of breezy semi-comic scenes. Watching Charlie Wilson's War, the viewer finds out how congressional appropriations are made, what weapons are needed to take down tanks and helicopters, how much that costs and how weapons can be funneled from Israel and Egypt into Pakistan. This is about the most effortless education in the realities of 1980s geopolitics that anyone could ever hope to get. Just two things are missing from the movie, and they're enough to keep it from greatness. Despite the grandeur of the story - Wilson and his colleagues really did do something amazing - there's little grandeur in the filmmaking, save for a wonderful shot in which Wilson visits Afghan refugees, and the camera pulls back to show that their makeshift camp goes on for miles and miles. Perhaps the glibness of the writing got in the director's way, but it shouldn't have.  The other thing missing is that, for all his scene by scene brilliance, Sorkin finds no overarching personal drama on which to hang the action. Peter Morgan found that (or simply imposed it) in his screenplay for The Queen, so that a movie about the repercussions of Princess Diana's death was also very much about the relationship between Elizabeth II and Tony Blair. There's nothing of comparable interest in Charlie Wilson's War, no crucial interplay of personalities, no combat between individuals of strong will. The relationship between Wilson and Herring seemed to have potential along that line, but nothing dramatic happens between them. In a story about real people, it's sometimes hard to make things up. Still, though not great, Charlie Wilson's War is definitely worthwhile and entertaining, and clocking in at a modest 98 minutes, it doesn't overstay its welcome.-- Advisory: This film contains strong language, drug use, sexual situations and graphic images of wounded people.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: Comic fantasy. Starring Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore. Directed by Tim Burton. (PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It says something about Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy that, for all the movie's visual extravagance, audiences will walk out talking about Depp. This time, Depp doesn't rely on quirky mannerisms but creates and inhabits a complete character, an eccentric whose serene facade is a veneer over an inner life of jangled nerves, resentment and childhood wounds. Willy is remarkably self-controlled. He rarely says what he's thinking, but the audience can read his thoughts -- and his struggle to stay polite, as well as the frequent discord between his thoughts and his demeanor, becomes extremely funny. It becomes funnier, in fact, as the movie goes on. Based on the children's book by Roald Dahl of the same name, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is about a boy (Freddie Highmore) from a poor but loving family, who lives in the town where Willy Wonka has his world-famous factory. Charlie's family is so poor that they eat cabbage soup every night, and only once a year does Charlie get a chocolate bar, on his birthday. A leisurely opening, related by Charlie's grandfather, tells us of the history of the Wonka factory, from its beginnings to the fateful day when Willy fired his workers and closed his gates to the public. Since then, the factory has kept operating, through automation and other mysterious means. Charlie dreams of one day being able to go inside the factory, and his hopes are raised when Willy announces, through a written statement, that he will allow five children, accompanied by their parents, to visit the chocolate factory for a daylong tour. The odds of winning an invitation are remote -- golden invitations have been inserted inside five randomly selected candy bars -- and Charlie watches sadly as four children, each horrible in his or her own way, find a ticket. But, of course, Charlie ultimately finds one, too, and, on the appointed day, he and his grandfather are there with the four other kids and their parents, standing outside the gate of the Wonka factory. Until the entrance of Willy Wonka, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory seems as if it's going to be just a well-made children's story, with exceptional art direction and a few flashes of knowing irreverence there to keep adults from slipping into a coma. But once those gates open, it becomes a different movie. The children are welcomed by a musical production number, staged with automated puppets that accidentally burst into flames. And then Willy appears, in his Prince Valiant haircut and green gloves, looking almost as pale and acting almost as strangely as Michael Jackson. Depp plays Willy as someone who has been out of social circulation for years. He lives in his own imagination, surrounded by a tiny race of workers known as the Oompa-Loompas, and so being around these kids -- especially the four brats -- is a strain. It also brings up memories of his own childhood, which the movie renders in comical flashbacks, in which Willy's father, a dentist, refuses to let him eat candy. The dentist father also explains why Willy has blindingly white, ridiculously perfect teeth. Once the film gets inside the factory, it takes on a structural sameness. But it staves off monotony thanks to the clever script, Depp's consistently amusing performance and the startling and inventive scenes and sets. There's a chocolate waterfall, and Willie and his guests travel on a chocolate river on a red ship in the shape of a candy seahorse. In one room, a pink sheep is being sheared. That takes up maybe 15 seconds of the movie, but it's beautiful and stays in the mind. There's a wonderful scene of squirrels -- about a hundred of them -- sitting on white stools in a blue room, shelling walnuts to be used in Willy's chocolate bars. It's also worth mentioning that all of the Oompa-Loompas are played by the same actor (Deep Roy). The brats are conveyed in broad strokes and played with gusto by the child actors. There's a German glutton (Philip Wiegratz), a spoiled rich girl (Julia Winter), a know-it-all (Jordan Fry) and a competitive sports monster (AnnaSophia Robb). Interestingly, in photographing these kids, everything is done to make their faces perfectly smooth, like computer animation characters. It has the nice effect of making them at once more beautiful and more inhuman. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer who had a leading role in Finding Neverland. His performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor. -- Advisory: Bratty child behavior and mild mayhem. ",1
"Chasing Liberty: Romantic comedy. Starring Mandy Moore, Matthew Goode and Mark Harmon. Directed by Andy Cadiff. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) She plays Anna, the daughter of a U.S. president in the midst of his second term, and just to make sure that half the audience doesn't hate her on principle, the president (Mark Harmon) is patterned on neither Clinton nor Bush II. Actually, President Foster seems a little like Howard Dean, in that he speaks in complete sentences and barely ever cracks a smile. The president has a country to run, and unlike Theodore Roosevelt, who understood he could either run the United States or his young daughter, President Foster tries to keep a tight grip on 18-year-old Anna's comings and goings. What's immediately apparent -- and refreshing -- about Chasing Liberty is that it doesn't play cute with its premise. The first scene shows the elaborate security involved in the first daughter's going on a dinner date. The young man is all but strip-searched on his way onto the White House grounds, and a caravan of agents follows their car to the restaurant. As they eat, everyone stares. The movie establishes quickly that this is a suffocating way to grow up and an impossible way for a vivacious girl to come into her young womanhood. Anna longs to cut loose, but she's not so ambitious as to try to run away -- that is, not until she goes with her father to Prague and he betrays a promise he made to her. Typical politician. He tells her she can go to a show accompanied by only two agents, but she soon realizes she is surrounded by them. She makes a break for it and hooks up with Ben (Matthew Goode), a British photographer motorcycling through Europe. Chasing Liberty is a kind of remake of It Happened One Night (1934), updated and retooled for a young audience that won't recognize the connection. There are faint allusions to the famous hitchhiking scene and to the bedroom scene in which the two sleep with a partition between them. Like Claudette Colbert, Moore plays a young heiress on the run. And Ben, like the Clark Gable character in the original version, is charged with bringing her back. Unknown to Anna, he's a Secret Service agent, too: Her father has decided to let Anna have the illusion of rebellion, but in perfect safety. Anna and Ben romp through Prague and, later, Venice, having adventures and misadventures and meeting various colorful characters, and it's all quite engaging. We understand what this freedom means to Anna, partly thanks to Moore's expressive intelligence, but also through director Andy Cadiff's technique. We see a rock concert, a late-night outdoor screening of an operatic film and the splendors of historic cities through the eyes of a young girl experiencing them for the first time. Everything is injected with a sense of exuberance and unfolding life. And it all seems an analogue for Anna's blossoming sexual awareness, which is handled with frankness and good taste, both of which are a surprise. The movie's one sour note, a minor one but it grates, is its depiction of the Venetians, specifically a gondolier and his mother, who are presented as the sort of happy hysterics one might find in a spaghetti sauce commercial. In fact, Venetians are, if anything, reserved and shrewd, and gondoliers are particularly crafty customers. The filmmakers shot Chasing Liberty on location and had the real people staring them in the face. Why persist in the condescending stereotype, when the truth is more interesting? Advisory: This film contains discreet nudity and sexual situations. ",1
"Children's film. Starring Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maggie Smith. Directed by Susanna White. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The new Nanny McPhee movie, Nanny McPhee Returns, has a lighter spirit than its predecessor, but it arrives at the same warm and touching place. Emma Thompson not only stars as the homely supernatural nanny, but she also wrote the screenplay, as she did last time. So this is turning into quite a sideline: Thompson has now made two superior children's films that in look and spirit are completely their own thing, outside the children's-film trends of the past decade. Nanny McPhee takes place in a storybook England, in a countryside of rolling hills, green fields and farm animals. It takes place, as well, at a storybook period, which once upon a time was invariably the Victorian age but now, with the passage of years, has become World War II. This is the Britain that Americans in particular marvel at and feel in awe of, this nation of people who stammer and say, Excuse me but must be tougher than we are, because they beat back Hitler.In London, the blitz is on, but in the countryside the only warring parties are the three children belonging to Isabel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), whose husband is away fighting. She has already lost control of the household when yet two more children arrive, her niece and nephew from London, whose mother sent them away so they could avoid the bombs. The city kids are rich, spoiled and wonderfully obnoxious, especially young Cyril, who is played by Eros Vlahos, a kid with a wonderful face. Pudgy, witty and scowling, he already looks like Samuel Johnson or Charles Laughton and will probably look exactly the same when he's 60.It is the nature of all Nanny McPhee stories that there must be bratty kids; otherwise, Nanny McPhee would never appear. But these films at least have a healthy recognition that bratty behavior exists and that it's not precocious or charming, and it's not to be excused. Perhaps this quality, most of all, makes Nanny McPhee Returns, for all its special effects, feel old-fashioned in the most refreshing way.The movie's one other concession to modernity, besides the computer graphics, is the relentless poo-poo and flatulence jokes that have been inserted, ostensibly to make 11-year-olds scream with delight. Maggie Smith - that is, Dame Maggie Smith - playing a demented shopkeeper, plops down on a wet cow patty and announces that her seat is quite comfy. At another point, the movie leaves you with the impression that Nanny has apologized for flatulence. In retrospect, it's actually remarkable that Julie Andrews got through all 139 minutes of Mary Poppins without ever passing wind.In any case, Nanny shows up at Isabel's door, at a point of maximum chaos, looking spectacularly ugly: Two huge moles (she really ought to have them looked at), a long snaggle tooth and frizzy hair. With her long magic staff, she takes charge immediately, and the next morning she tells the children, When you need me, but don't want me, I'll stay. When you want me but no longer need me, I'll go. It's a cryptic remark, which Thompson enunciates with a full appreciation of the character's supernatural, eternal quality. Nanny knows ultimate truths that she cannot reveal, things that, from Thompson's serious demeanor, we might infer are not entirely consoling. The universal order may be ultimately benevolent, but Thompson suggests that it's also exacting.Ralph Fiennes shows up for a strong scene in which he meets up with his son and wants to say that he loves him. And so he does, like a true Englishman of his generation: Done you good, that country air. Carry on. In a much different way, Gyllenhaal brings a fullness of heart to the proceedings that contributes much to the movie's emotional punch. The original Nanny McPhee may have been a slightly better movie in most of its particulars, but the sequel can put tears in your eyes, and that's no small thing. It might be the ultimate measure.",1
"Christian Dior — the man, not the name — has been dead since 1955, and yet somehow the company he created and ran for only a decade has remained an important force in fashion. A series of chief designers have maintained the Dior tradition, combining their own visions with Dior’s flowing, hyper-feminine aesthetic.“Dior and I” is a documentary about the appointment of the Flemish designer Raf Simons, previously known for men’s fashion, into the top creative position at Dior in 2012, and about the eight weeks between that appointment and the debut of Dior’s new line. For people already interested in fashion, the film’s appeal will be obvious, but “Dior and I” deserves to go beyond a small target audience.The documentary offers a privileged behind-the-scenes look at the workings of a business. It’s also about the difficulties of the creative process, the running of an organization, and the adjustments that must be made when a new boss is in town. For the top man, it’s a life of stress — of trying to keep the creative channels open, while facing deadlines and juggling various personalities. At the start of the film, Simons is 44 and looks 10 years younger. By the end of those eight weeks, he looks like he’s pushing 50. For those not in the know, the sheer work involved in putting together a new collection is a revelation. Things have to be designed, and then the clothes have to be made. At Dior, the people who do the sewing get to choose the designs they want to work on. This is creative, technical work — with measurements down to the last millimeter. Then, once the clothing is sewn, models put it on, and then further adjustments are made to the design. This goes on and on until the morning of the premiere.As bosses go, Simons is a nice guy, and his second in charge — the position that might normally go to a henchman — is the even-nicer Pieter Mulier, who radiates humor, goodwill and an even temper. Despite the ghastly pressure, Simons comes close to hitting the ceiling only once, when on the very day he needs to see his designs, the head of his atelier is in New York doing a fitting for a wealthy client. The problem is that this client orders $350,000 in clothing every year. It’s hard to say no to someone like that. Simons describes fashion as a conversation between the present and the past, and in his Dior designs, he sets out to take Dior’s “gigantic and sublime” history and blend it with the modern era. Though we see him working throughout “Dior and I,” director Frederic Tcheng holds off on showing us most of the clothing until the premiere, so we see it for the first time along with Jennifer Lawrence, Harvey Weinstein and other A-list bigwigs. His work is beautiful.Good thing it is. By the time of the premiere, Simons, an otherwise fairly contained person, is bursting into tears from terror. Imagine going through this every six months. ",1
"Christmas movies thrive on the sense that we’re all in this together, “fellow passengers to the grave” as Charles Dickens put it. That sense was common in the 1940s and ’50s, an era that produced some of our best Christmas movies. That’s in stark contrast to today, an era so steeped in self-glorification that the most popular genre is the superhero movie, which is all about expressing the self at all costs, even if it means the routine destruction of entire city blocks.So, coming when it does, “The Man Who Invented Christmas” is not just a good movie but a welcome relief. If you’re waiting for that nice Christmas feeling, this movie brings it on. It tells the story of Charles Dickens’ creation of “A Christmas Carol,” which becomes a way for us to experience that classic once again, but from a different angle. We’re transported back to the early Victorian period and get to see the various key moments from that story play out as if in Dickens’ imagination.The movie is based on the nonfiction book by Les Standiford, which deals with the creation of “A Christmas Carol” and with its importance in Christmas iconography. That novella, which Dickens wrote very quickly in the fall of 1843, defined the holiday forever as the calendar’s biggest celebration. It also defined the way we think of Christmas. If you’ve ever dreamed of how nice it might be to visit London during Christmas week, you’re probably responding to “A Christmas Carol.”Apparently, when Dickens wrote the novella, he was coming off of two flops and was in danger of being regarded as a flash in the pan. He was 31 and didn’t start writing until October, for a book that needed to be in the stores by Christmas week. Actually, if you go back and read “A Christmas Carol,” you can tell it was written quickly. The writing is much more expansive in the beginning, and the last chapter is remarkably condensed.Dan Stevens plays Dickens as a big personality, someone exhausting to live with, whose wife complains that she has to walk on eggshells, never knowing what mood he might be in. He’s an emotional man but a man of compassion, with a tortured history, and he’s facing pressure from all sides — financial pressure, pressure from the characters in his head wanting to come out and pressure to produce and live up to his already exalted reputation.Screenwriter Susan Coyne takes Standiford’s book and layers it with appealing fictional conceits. (Coyne is best known as one of the creators of the TV series “Slings and Arrows,” a Canadian show about life inside a Shakespearean theater, in which Coyne also played the office manager.) Here, Ebenezer Scrooge is called forth into Dickens’ writing room as soon as Dickens finds the perfect name for him. For most of what follows, Dickens and Scrooge, who is played with sneering relish by Christopher Plummer, argue about where to take the story.Coyne also has fun putting lines from “A Christmas Carol” into the mouths of various characters, as Dickens takes inspiration from the life around him.Rarely has a movie ever captured the importance of a writer’s having unbroken concentration in order to work. On repeated occasions in “The Man Who Invented Christmas,” Dickens is interrupted by his family while he is in midst of conversation with his various characters, and this produces an effect of impatience within the audience. We want him to work — nothing seems more important.“The Man Who Invented Christmas” ends up hitting most of the notes Dickens sounded so memorably in his classic: forgiveness, forbearance, generosity, charity, family feeling. Just as we worry, in “A Christmas Carol,” over the health of Tiny Tim, the movie makes us worry over Dickens’ decision as to Tiny Tim’s fate — even though we know already what it will be. Like the Victorians, we need to believe that gentleness and goodness can survive in our world, and movies like this help.",1
"City of Ember: Fantasy. Starring Bill Murray, Tim Robbins, Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan. Directed by Gil Kenan. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Movies are planned months and years in advance, and yet it's not uncommon for films to arrive that speak directly to the thoughts and fears of the particular moment. Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising: Just as a person expresses the unconscious in dreams, a culture expresses its unconscious in movies. And so today, just as everyone is on edge about the global economic crisis (and no one has forgotten 9/11), we're getting movies about civic catastrophe, about civilizations absolutely and completely falling apart.  Last week, it was Blindness, a well-made and unsettling film in which millions of people suddenly lose their sight. Today, we get City of Ember, an impressive and imaginative fantasy about human beings who live in an underground city, two centuries after a nuclear war. They have no knowledge of the earth's surface. They know nothing about the world that went before them. For them, Ember is the entire world - and that world is about to go to pieces.  If you want to look for a metaphor, the search won't be long. The elders who established Ember gave it 200 good years. They gave it a generator and enough food to last two centuries, but now time has run out. The pipes are rusting. Food is scarce. Most ominous, the generator on which the entire civilization depends has started to stall. Two or three times a week, it just stops functioning for a few seconds, causing all the electricity to go out.  City of Ember has an emotional impact that goes way beyond a clever metaphor. In an early scene, a chipper young messenger (Saoirse Ronan) is making her way through the town square when the generator stalls again - and this time for longer than ever before. The people are so relieved, and so willing to believe that maybe it won't happen again, that the moment is touching. It's also rather touching that their world is such a pathetic echo of real civilization, that their sky is just a bunch of lightbulbs and that their religion has something to do with waiting for the builders to return. Yet they want to hold on to what they have. The tone of City of Ember is flexible enough to allow for both drama and satire, with neither feeling discordant. Bill Murray plays the mayor, a complete phony who is looking for a way to escape Ember, even as he is announcing a task force to investigate the blackouts. It won't surprise anyone to know that Murray is funny in the role - he's funny just sitting at his desk with a deadpan expression. But he goes deeper. For example, take the moment in which he's walking onto a balcony to address a throng of citizens who idolize him. Just as he's about to reveal himself to the masses, he assumes a look of theatrical geniality that's so unnatural and bizarre, and yet so calculated to please, that it's chilling to see. For a split second, that face actually scared me. Though Murray makes the most of his scenes, and Tim Robbins has a nice featured role as an inventor, the film focuses mainly on the adventures of two teenagers, who gradually come to discover the City of Ember's founding secrets. The young actors, Ronan (Atonement) and Harry Treadaway, couldn't be better. If you have any reservations about going to a movie starring two teenagers, put them aside. Also, if the thought of a movie that takes place underground holds little appeal, think again. The film's design is not murky and shadowy, but rich and bright, and the whole rendering of this underground world is fascinating. I've said almost nothing about the story. Good. I'll let you discover it. But just two general comments: The pacing is varied but energetic, and for that you can credit director Gil Kenan (Monster House). And the story, based on Jeanne Duprau's novel of the same name, is beautifully constructed. It builds until it reaches the point that it's one edge-of-your-seat moment after another.  All this, and you won't have to check your brain at the door, either. City of Ember offers a rich reward on a modest 95-minute investment. -- Advisory:Moments of menace and a scary monster, but, otherwise, this is pretty wholesome entertainment.",1
"City of Ghosts: Melodrama. Starring Matt Dillon, James Caan, Gerard Depardieu and Natascha McElhone. Directed by Matt Dillon. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That's all to the good. Matt Dillon, who directed the movie and co-wrote it with Barry Gifford, pushes the conventions of realism right to the border of absurdity without ever crossing it, and the result is a hyper-real portrait of life -- a vision as experienced during an adrenaline rush. The filmmakers sustain this mood for an almost heroic stretch, though in the last half hour the narrative does gradually sink back to earth. Then City of Ghosts gets heavy with plot, leading to a conventional who-cares finale. Along the way, there's much to savor. Dillon plays Jimmy, a collaborator in an insurance scam that eventually blows up, so he goes to Cambodia, in search of both his partner (James Caan) and his take. Upon arrival, he starts running into exaggerated personalities -- a gay hustler (Rob Campbell), a sweaty French hotelier (Gerard Depardieu) and a saintly taxi driver (played by a real- life taxi driver Sereyvuth Kem). City of Ghosts was shot in Cambodia -- not Toronto or Montreal standing in for Cambodia -- and its distinct atmosphere, of dirt streets and dark alleys, old buildings and airy rooms, gets under the viewer's skin. The country's mix of East and West, squalor and beauty, chaos and tranquillity seems right for a movie balanced on the knife edge between drama and farce. It's also a perfect backdrop for Depardieu's exaggerated personality and poker- faced comic style. As the hotel owner-bartender, he's a screamer and a brawler who seems nonetheless to consider himself the most reasonable of men. The screenplay gets wonderful mileage out of an incident in which a monkey, in Jimmy's hotel room, steals his sunglasses and jumps out the window. There are three little follow-up scenes to that, including one in which Jimmy tells the hotel owner, who insists that Jimmy has to be mistaken. There was no monkey, he says, lying in the most transparent way. I don't know what those scenes are there for, except to delight. Reason enough. Dillon has no trouble directing himself. He's not self-effacing, nor does he give himself excessive close-ups. In its handling of its lead actor, City of Ghosts is like any other Dillon movie, except it's smarter than most. Jimmy's search for his partner becomes, in a sense, a search for his father, as well as for a separate identity. In this no-man's-land, he needs direction and help from strangers, who seem to pop up out of nowhere, mysteriously, like characters in a dream, and vanish from the film. Dillon and Gifford's willingness to put truths into the mouths of minor characters and let each of them have his moment is more than a novel narrative strategy. Behind it is the suggestion of a philosophy -- a kind of fatalistic, live-and-let-live egalitarianism that's appealing. I just wish I liked the story better. After 80 minutes or so, the movie comes to a place in which the fun stuff becomes irrelevant, and the plot is only mildly interesting. Still, it's certainly not work sitting through it, especially with James Caan swaggering onto the scene. If a few conventional turns were necessary to hold this otherwise highly original movie together, that was a small price to pay. This film contains strong language and violence. ",1
"Clara (Catherine de Lean) and Nikolai (Dimitri Storoge) share emotionally shattering revelations in the aftermath of a one-night stand in 'Nuit #1.Clara (Catherine de Lean) and Nikolai (Dimitri Storoge) share emotionally shattering revelations in the aftermath of a one-night stand in 'Nuit #1.Drama. Starring Catherine de Léan and Dimitri Storoge. Directed by Anne Émond. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 91 minutes.) Two people, who've just met in a bar, go home to his lousy apartment and proceed to have sex, and we are there watching them in Nuit #1, a raw and explicit French-Canadian film that I must admit to having mixed feelings about. The characters are fictional, but the sex is real - as in the actors Catherine de Léan and Dimitri Storoge are really doing that - and somehow this doesn't seem like a proper use of sex to me, nor of cinema, nor of the actors, though maybe they didn't mind. Following sex, she tries to sneak out, and then a conversation ensues, a long one. He talks about what a complete, self-destructive mess he is - long monologues - and then she talks about what an emotionally disconnected empty shell of a person she is. And they each sit there listening, because each knows he or she is no better than the other. Here's the thing: This movie would be easy to mock as maudlin and self-important, but there's something about it that can't be dismissed. The monologues may be theatrical and presentational - director Anne Émond made this film when she was 29 and too young to be subtle.But the characters' voices are alive; and the financial and emotional traps they're in are believable and ultimately moving. These are young lives derailed, people without hope, purpose or moral grounding. Nuit #1 is an expression of all this and perhaps a symptom of it, too. What's more - there's no point in denying this - somehow the monologues' effectiveness is partly tied to the fact that we see the actors put it all on the line in that first scene. It throws them into the same stewpot as the characters and raises the stakes all around.  So this is a different kind of movie, as graphic as porn, but not porn, not titillating and not unintelligent. It's committed - some new and highly disturbing version of a really good movie.",1
"Claude Chabrol is dead, but there’s Anne Fontaine to take his place as a French director who is prolific, reliable and always accessible, and whose work is like an ideal hybrid between French and American influences. Like most French filmmakers, Fontaine is more interested in behavior and relationships than in epic confrontations, but she also has a feel for genre, knows how to tell a story and never wastes the audience’s time.Like Chabrol’s, Fontaine’s movies are, at their worst, not bad and, at their best, pretty close to great, so there’s a certain reliability in the product, not only in quality but also in subject matter. Fontaine’s movies tend to be about love and its dangers, the darker side of passion. And that’s what we get in “Gemma Bovery,” an entertaining and disturbing variation on Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary.”Based on the graphic novel by Posy Simmonds, it’s the story of a baker (Fabrice Luchini), living in Normandy, whose new neighbors are a British couple, Charles and Gemma Bovery. As a Flaubert fanatic, he is struck by their names’ similarity to the characters in the novel. He also finds himself with an uncomfortable attraction for Gemma (Gemma Arterton), a woman half his age. Her arrival, he says in voice-over, signals “the end of 10 years of sexual tranquillity.”Most of the film is told from the standpoint of the baker, who obsessively watches Gemma and starts noticing patterns in her behavior that recall Emma Bovary. He notices that she is bored and distracted, which he finds fascinating: “A boring woman who can’t stand her boring life is not boring,” he says. Soon, her restlessness leads to some of the same actions that Emma took in the novel.As the pivot point of the story, the baker is an arresting character, in that ostensibly he watches Gemma with a sense of dread, afraid that she will end up like Emma (very unhappy). Yet at the same time, he seems to unconsciously hope Gemma will share Emma’s fate, even to the point of helping to bring it on.  Luchini plays all sides of the baker’s conflict with a clear and complex understanding. Passion is dangerous. That is the message of most of Fontaine’s movies, and it applies here in interesting ways. Gemma tries to be a free spirit in an unfree world, to assert herself and take what’s hers. But there’s something consuming about the admiration she inspires that can only complicate her life. Ultimately, “Gemma Bovery” emerges as a feminist take on the Flaubert novel, one that lands in an uneasy place. Again like Chabrol, Fontaine has a way of making you laugh, on and off, for 90 minutes, before leaving you feeling a little queasy from too much truth. ",1
"Clip: Sea Drama. Starring Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts. Directed by Jacques Audiard. In French with English subtitles. (R. 118 minutes.) Rust and Bone is a tough movie about tough people for a tough audience. So prepare to get roughed up a little. The main characters are a bouncer who earns money on the side by getting into amateur no-holds-barred fistfights and a woman who trains and performs with killer whales. If she were any tougher, she'd be in a Kathryn Bigelow movie.  In an early scene, Alain the bouncer (Matthias Schoenaerts) breaks up a bar fight and drives Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) home. There, her boyfriend starts giving Alain some attitude, and so Alain just looks at the guy. That's it, just looks. But as he does, you can almost see every drop of that boyfriend's testosterone form into a puddle on the floor, and from then on the poor man might as well be singing the coloratura repertory. Minutes later, Stephanie is rubbing the boyfriend's face in his fear and telling him that they're finished.  Rust and Bone, directed by Jacques Audiard (A Prophet), could be described as a demented love story, except that it's not crazy; it makes perfect sense. It presents two people who ostensibly should not be together and slowly, to them and to us, reveals their points of intersection and the places where they fill in each other's blanks. In an American romantic comedy, love is an excuse for people to return to infancy, but this is a French romantic drama, and that means two adults, lots of growing pains and an education. If you know anything about Rust and Bone, you know this is the movie in which Cotillard plays a woman whose legs are bitten off above the knee by a whale. She wakes up in the hospital, this most physical of women, and sees that her legs are gone. It's a difficult acting moment in that the audience is expecting a difficult acting moment. All eyes are on Cotillard: What will she do? Will we believe it? And what's amazing about Cotillard is that in no more than a second, we forget to notice that she's acting. We're simply plunged into the character's circumstances and feel, in a direct and physical way, the character's horror, her anguish and her animal terror. (It is, by the way, a scene very similar to the one played by Ronald Reagan in Kings Row from 1942. So if Cotillard ever becomes president of France, it started here.)Left to Right: Marion Cotillard as Stephanie and Matthias Schoenaerts as Ali in Rust and Bone.Left to Right: Marion Cotillard as Stephanie and Matthias Schoenaerts as Ali in Rust and Bone. As played by Schoenaerts, Alain is no hero. He's a limited guy, an unthinking guy, too sure of himself and without much in the way of human sympathy. Yet it's his limitations, even more than his strengths, that makes him good company for Stephanie following her accident. He doesn't feel sorry for her. He barely notices her pain. He is as merciless as life, but he is life; he's alive. A more sensitive man would make her feel embarrassed. But for him, she's a sexual possibility - in fact, her reduced circumstances just means that he probably has a better shot.  Schoenaerts is, in many ways, as impressive as Cotillard. He shows us a man who has no fear, not a man who has overcome fear, but one who doesn't really know what it is. Other people walk into the room with a game plan, as protection against what might happen. He has no plan, because he feels prepared for whatever comes, and he truly doesn't care what anybody thinks. But in the end, can a person like that, who cares so little, really care about another person? That's the question of the movie.  Like most French films, Rust and Bone has a touch of what Lincoln called the slows. It has also has that peculiar Gallic tone deafness when it comes to American music. At one point, Stephanie rocks out in her wheelchair, feeling life coming back to her. Guess what song has these magical powers of rejuvenation? Love Shack by the B-52s.  Still no one who sees Rust and Bone will ever forget this movie or its people.",1
"Collateral: Crime thriller. Starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Directed byMichael Mann. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie was directed by Michael Mann (The Last of the Mohicans, The Insider), a meticulous filmmaker who can film frenzy without getting lost in it and whose quiet scenes are just as interesting as his busy ones. Mann's alertness to the subtle movements inside characters and to the interplay of people is unmistakable, and it helps explain why the performances in his pictures are consistently superior. This one is no exception. A measure of Mann's talent for the quiet comes in an early scene. Max (Jamie Foxx) is driving his cab, and a lawyer (Jada Pinkett Smith) gets in. She's wound tight, getting ready for a big case the next morning, but he charms her into talking. The scene isn't remarkable. What's remarkable is the time Mann lavishes on it. Every gradation of their budding intimacy is offered up for our scrutiny, culminating in a long, arresting close-up of Pinkett Smith as the lawyer decides whether she should answer a question the cabdriver has asked her. Any director can point at a character and tell us we should care about this person. With Mann, we start caring long before we know we've been manipulated. Then she gets out, and Vincent (Tom Cruise) gets in. He's a well-dressed, well-spoken man with a leather case, someone who could easily be mistaken for a businessman, except that there's something off about his look and manner. He's too slick, too Eurotrash, and too Johnny Mnemonic to be a corporate drone, and if he were a playboy he wouldn't be carrying that case. He asks Max questions and responds to his answers with agreeable platitudes, but his mouth twists down at the sides as he talks. If Max could turn around and just look at this man's face, he'd know that any Los Angeles wino in the backseat would have been less of a safety risk than this guy. Tom Cruise has always been a good, solid actor. What makes him better than just a good actor is that he's a game actor, willing to throw himself into odd characterizations, to hide inside a part and play at the fringes of his star image. In Collateral, Mann has him with a head of gray hair and a closely cropped gray beard, a look that reads as both decadent and mechanistic. Within the limits of the script -- which is great for surfaces but doesn't go very deep -- Cruise tries to suggest a guy whose soul has been cut off from the spiritual oxygen that feeds everyone else. He's dead inside, with a flat, dead voice, someone completely alone and incapable of being anything but alone. At the same time, there's no play for audience sympathy. He's the villain, and the cabdriver is our guy. It is soon, very soon, revealed that Vincent is a contract killer, and so Max is a hostage in his own cab. Vincent's proposed agenda is for Max to drive him to a set number of locations and for Max to wait in the car while he gets out and kills people. You know, kind of like helping someone with a paper route, only more morally challenging. Collateral, which starts out tense, builds from there, with a series of suspenseful encounters and with a climax on top of a climax. The movie never fails. It never deepens, either, never plays with the premise or goes somewhere unexpected, but it's always satisfying. Foxx can act. He's up to the role's demands, conveying fear, confusion and frustration, but more important the exhaustion and recklessness that can easily follow when someone's been scared for so long. Mark Ruffalo, as an honest cop on Vincent's tail, and Pinkett Smith are vivid in modest roles. In an even smaller role and just as vivid is Spanish superstar Javier Bardem, who turns up as a drug kingpin with his back to the wall. Bardem can be the sweetest guy in the world onscreen. He's not that here. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and violence. ",1
"Comedy-Drama. Starring John C. Reilly, Marisa Tomei and Jonah Hill. Directed by Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Cyrus is the third film in four years by the Duplass brothers, who continue to resist two destructive temptations. They are wisely not imitating their previous successes, but instead are choosing to branch out in terms of scale, narrative and budget. And they are not setting out to show how intelligent they are. They are not trying to prove themselves to snobs who aren't paying close enough attention to realize they're brilliant. Instead, they're following their own path and vision. It is too soon to say that these guys constitute one of the best and most hopeful strains in American cinema today. But it is not too soon to introduce the idea by saying it's too soon to say it. Already the Duplass name on a motion picture is reason for anticipated pleasure and careful scrutiny. They're telling new kinds of stories about new kinds of people. Under cover of a seemingly fumbling and stumbling style, they're offering tight narratives and incisive character portraits. As in The Puffy Chair and Baghead, the Duplasses once again show themselves in Cyrus to be very good at delineating character and at conveying strong feelings. And so we meet John (John C. Reilly), a professional copy editor who has been in an emotional trough ever since his wife left him seven years ago. Now the wife (Catherine Keener), who is about to remarry, is encouraging him to go out and make himself available, and so he puts on his leather sports jacket and heads off to a party. Trying to pick up women is awkward past a certain age, like trying to burglarize a house while carrying your own siren and wearing a flashing neon sign that says Thief. At one point, John gives up and just tells a woman how he's feeling, and it's a beautiful description of the character as he might describe himself: He has been depressed for years, but he feels that he has something to offer, that he's essentially a fun-loving guy who just happens to be miserable. The woman walks away, but a few minutes later another woman, who has heard his speech, approaches him, and she's played by Marisa Tomei.Younger folks may need to have this explained to them: If you are a single man over 40, and a woman like Marisa Tomei comes over expressing appreciation and interest, this is not merely good news, or even very good news. Rather, this is something - like, say, watermelon, or the 1969 Mets - that's akin to proof of a benevolent God. No wonder he can't believe it and asks if she's flirting with him. Why? he asks. I'm like Shrek!In trying to convey the flavor and style of the Duplasses' storytelling, it may seem as though I've given away loads of plot. In fact, I've told you only about the first seven or eight minutes. The movie is called Cyrus, and you've heard nothing yet about this title character - Tomei's son in the picture - who is played by Jonah Hill with an eerie and watchful shrewdness. The Duplasses are showing how modern Americans think, talk and live. Like Woody Allen, their world is fairly specific, in this case white, educated, artistically minded, culturally plugged in, but struggling. Not poor, but fairly broke. But instead of just offering slices of life, which might be interesting enough, they are devising real stories and placing vivid characters in collision. Suffice it to say that Cyrus, though funny and unexpected, is also chamber drama about three people in a compressed atmosphere who feel that everything they have - or at least everything they love - is at stake. Don't be fooled by the casual style. There is nothing casual about these emotions, or about the talent of these two filmmakers.-- Advisory: Strong language, sex talk and sexual situations.",1
"Comedy-adventure. Starring Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Martin Freeman. Directed by Edgar Wright. (R. 109 minutes.) One of the weirder aspects of adolescence is that it's possible to have close friends you don't like, that you're just thrown in with. In The World's End, one of those friends comes back into the lives of his four former high school buddies, two decades later, hoping to re-create the most glorious day of his youth, an all-night drinking binge. And they give in to the force of his personality and agree to join him. In the opening sequence, we hear Gary (Simon Pegg), in voice-over, describe this great night, which took place in 1990. The goal was to drink a pint of beer in each of the 12 pubs found in the town of Newton Haven, culminating in the bar known as the World's End, but they stopped at 10 bars and never completed the circuit. When the movie cuts to the grown-up Gary, we realize we haven't been hearing a conventional movie voice-over, that he is telling his story at what seems to be a group therapy session - or perhaps a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. That opening sets the tone for a movie that revels in complicated double emotions and perceptions. Gary is a man who makes things happen, but he's also pathetic. The memories of youth are beautiful, but also tawdry. There's also a larger point the movie wants to make about people in general, that human beings are magnificent in their individuality, but also flawed and narrow.  Pegg, who co-wrote the screenplay, has written himself an arresting role, and he attacks it with intensity and invention. He is antic, mercurial and relentless, constantly joking or cajoling or on the make, never letting down his guard, always pressing some advantage. Through it all, Pegg suggests that reliving this night is of enormous and desperate importance to Gary, though we never quite know why. That's good - no need to tie a neat bow on everything. The insoluble mysteries of life usually have to do with character, and so why shouldn't that also be the case in movies? The only real requirement is that such a character somehow feel true, and this one does. For about an hour, The World's End is the story of four settled men, in early middle age, dutifully following their old school friend from pub to pub. Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine and Eddie Marsan are all talented actors, with Frost and Freeman particularly skilled in comedy, and together the five principals create the sense of men who have known each other for many years. The banter is effortless; the comedy flows. Then the movie takes a turn into a rather unexpected direction, one foretold in the coming attractions trailer, and one that will probably be discussed in most reviews, but I won't do it here, because I enjoyed the surprise. To state it generally, the movie goes from a character study to something that is quite nutty, and yet it loses nothing in the transition. The characters stay vivid, the interaction essential, and the issues introduced remain on the table and continue to be developed. There's just this whole other crazy thing going on at the same time. The result is an original picture, not entirely successful, but successful enough, and delightful in its ability to surprise viewers, and juggle tones and keep every ball in the air. The World's End has the aura - and this might only be an attractive illusion - of something imagined whole, in a burst of inspiration, rather than as something labored over. It's like a screenwriter's daydream, fleshed out and brought to life, and as such, it feels personal, like we're seeing into someone's mind. It just so happens that it's a mind worth visiting.",1
"Comedy-drama. Starring André Wilms, Blondin Miguel and Kati Outinen. Directed by Saki Kaurismäki. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The first time you see one of Aki Kaurismäki's movies, it might take you a half hour to figure out that he's really joking around. The Finnish director's sense of humor is dry and dark as pitch, as he consistently finds moments of absurdity in the midst of strife and tragedy. In someone else's hands, this approach might have turned into a stylistic mannerism by now, but two things have prevented that. The first is that this is simply Kaurismäki - it's not a pose, just his way of seeing the world. The second factor is a function of the first: Because Kaurismäki's perspective is organic, not a pose, it's marvelously adaptive, capable of presenting a range of experience and inciting every emotion from scorn to exultation. Thus it's possible, for example, to laugh at the people in Le Havre and then, out of nowhere, to be touched and moved by them. It's as if he loves his characters enough to trick us into loving them, too. This time the Finnish director is working in France, and the story concerns an old shoeshine man who decides to help an African boy who has stowed away to the port of Le Havre. The old man (André Wilms) is a gruff character, not kind or especially virtuous, and his interest in the boy appears to be instinctive. It's not as though he is aware of doing a good deed. Kaurismäki stalwart Kati Outinen, as the old man's silent and ailing wife, is the key to the movie, even though she appears only sporadically. Something in her timid, understanding and impassive gaze, which is Kaurismäki's gaze as well, lets us know that she sees things in the old man that we don't see. Eventually, with a sense of release into the soul's mysteries, we come to believe her and not our own eyes.",1
"Comedy-drama. Starring Bruce Dern and Will Forte. Directed by Alexander Payne. (R. 115 minutes.) Director Alexander Payne marries an urbane sensibility with a rare awareness that there are entire stretches of the United States that are neither big cities nor the Wild West, and that life takes place there. His latest, Nebraska, in addition to being a strong showcase for Bruce Dern, is an authentic piece of Americana. There's no lying or condescending from this director. Nebraska feels pure. It's also a fascinating entity, rather like a patient with no apparent vital signs who is yet alive and active. Payne and screenwriter Bob Nelson keep the movie afloat, despite a story that, in its broad outlines, sounds like Waiting for Godot on quaaludes: Woody (Dern), an old man in the middle stages of dementia, becomes convinced that he has won a million dollars from something like Publishers Clearing House, and he sets out on foot from his home in Montana to collect the money from the home office in Lincoln, Neb.  Someday, when they write dissertations about Alexander Payne, Nebraska will be considered a companion piece to Payne's earlier About Schmidt (2002). Both involve disappointed old men. Both involve road trips through the middle of the country. Both depict old age as a time of spiritual confusion bordering on panic, and both present a long-term marriage as exhausted and of little comfort. If anything About Schmidt is the more pessimistic, as in downright despairing, while Nebraska suggests that hope itself might provide solace. Dern brings lots of history to this role. In his youth and middle age, he was renowned for playing men either angry, crazy or both. Woody is a departure only in that it places this character actor at the center of the film. Otherwise, Woody is not unlike the earlier Dern reimagined as an aging hero: still angry, but no longer dangerous; resentful of his own weakness, and hovering between reality and delusion.  Because Woody can no longer drive, and because this idee fixe is beyond the reach of reason, his younger son, David (Will Forte), decides to drive him to Nebraska. Forte is a revelation as a dramatic actor, full of feeling, with expressive eyes and an aura that radiates niceness. You look at him, and you look at Dern, and you think how awful it must have been for a sensitive boy to grow up with a taciturn, hard-drinking father. But now the son is grown up, and the father is diminished, so it's finally an even fight.  Conveniently for the story, we discover that Woody and his wife (June Squibb) spent most of their early married life in Nebraska, and so most of the film is taken up with scenes of Woody interacting with people from his past, including his formidable former business partner (Stacy Keach). Nebraska is wide enough to harmonize a range of experience, from the comedy that comes of everyone's believing that Woody has become a millionaire to the poignancy of his visiting the site of his unhappy childhood. June Squibb, as Woody's wife, is an important force in the film - sometimes comically unpleasant but someone whose drive and wit ultimately suggest the very attractive young woman that Woody married, years before. Like About Schmidt, Nebraska takes a dark view of old age, but at least offers the possibility that resiliency and self-delusion can make the last years tolerable. What is it that Woody wants with a million dollars? What is it in this wreck of a man that makes him want to believe that he's hit a jackpot? It's not about money or the things money can buy. It's about wanting to be envied, to be admired and looked at and regarded as someone special. That desire, which Dern conveys with beautiful subtlety, never goes away until they nail down the coffin lid.  Nebraska is shot in black and white, not the glossy black and white of Frances Ha, but a workmanlike black and white that doesn't try to make anything pretty. There are lots of long shots that emphasize the wideness of streets, the grandness of space and the contrasting smallness of the lives - of all individual lives in the big scheme. In the face of all that, self-belief would hardly seem possible, and yet people keep managing it. ",1
"Comedy-drama. Starring Fabrice Luchini, Natalia Verbeke and Sandrine Kiberlain. Directed by Philippe Le Guay. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Fabrice Luchini is one of the delights of world cinema, and in The Women on the 6th Floor he finds a role ideally suited to his odd mix of fussiness and sensitivity. He plays a Paris financier in the 1960s who lives a staid and rather self-satisfied existence, until he starts taking an interest in his new maid.  The maid, Maria (Natalia Verbeke), lives on the sixth floor of the building he owns, on the same floor with all the other maids - all of them Spanish - who work in the neighborhood. When he goes upstairs for the first time in years, he finds that their toilet is backed up and disgusting and that they have no shower. Expanded by his growing, if unacknowledged, affection for Maria, he gets to know all the women on the sixth floor, and the experience gradually opens up his life. Luchini often plays rigid, shrewd and easily bristled men, who behind their rigidity have something pure that they're trying to protect, including a boyish wonder. The financier's internal journey, manifested in action, is one of the joys of the film, but not the only one. The period detail grounds it and gives us an interesting look into class as it existed in France some 45 years ago.  Verbeke, an Argentine- born Spanish actress, is lovely here, gentle even as she brings to her performance a wisdom born of personal history - the hardship of growing up poor. Meanwhile, Sandrine Kiberlain, as the lady of the house, beautifully conveys the superficiality of the rich woman's life and the smallness of her mentality. Even better, she shows that this woman is growing into realizations that she has been frantically trying to put off.  Her point of arrival - when she says, Those women up there are alive. Down here we're dead - is a great moment because of the way Kiberlain lands it. It's as if she's looking into herself and seeing a vacuum. ",1
"Comedy-drama. Starring Karin Viard, Dany Boon, Patrick Bruel, Emmanuelle Seigner, Marina Fois and Marina Hands. Directed by Danièle Thompson. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The latest film from writer-director Danièle Thompson, Change of Plans, revolves around a dinner with a group of friends and acquaintances. They're all middle-aged and upper-middle-class, professional and busy, and no one really wants to be at the dinner. The movie shows their evening together, interspersed with other scenes that track their lives over the course of the subsequent year. Change of Plans is about nothing in particular, just a set of people and a particular mood, and it's the sort of movie that French filmmakers often attempt and usually come back with something boring. But this film isn't boring - it's not scintillating or spellbinding, either, just pleasantly honest and moderately interesting throughout. And the reason for this (qualified) success is Thompson's way with character and her precision with the moment-by-moment give-and-take, the tiny dramas of human interaction. She also commands a talented cast, all of them stars in their own right who have headlined their own films. Karin Viard - an actress whose versatility, work ethic, joy in performance and technical flawlessness make her France's equivalent of Meryl Streep - plays the hostess, a lawyer in her business hours. Dany Boon, the popular comedian, plays her husband. Also in the cast are Marina Hands (Lady Chatterley's Lover), Emmanuelle Seigner (Backstage), Patrick Bruel (Un Secret) and Marina Foïs, a comic actress not known in these parts, but just observe her skill here, as a gynecologist unhappy in her marriage.With the exception of Foïs and Bruel, as a sensitive oncologist who can no longer stand his job, the actors are not shown to their best advantage. That is, if you don't know them going in, the movie will give you little indication as to why these actors are so special. And frankly, if you're not someone who enjoys this variety of mood piece/social observation, you will probably not have much use for Change of Plans. In sum, it's a good, not great, movie of a type I like but that most people don't.-- Advisory: Sex talk, brief nudity, strong language.",1
"Comedy-drama. Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Ryan, Daphne Rubin-Vega and John Ortiz. Directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. (R. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Philip Seymour Hoffman's debut as a director, Jack Goes Boating, tells a modest story about a New York limousine driver whose life is seemingly fixed in concrete but who, in fact, is slowly, ever-so-slowly, setting out to improve himself. We watch him and, in the process, experience his world, the people he knows, the people he meets, and we come away with a sense of a certain kind of life in a certain kind of place.I'm just glad you didn't ask me about this movie a month ago. Initially after viewing, the film's virtues were apparent, but other things were distracting - a preciousness in some of the writing, an overplaying of a key dramatic scene, as well as an overall feeling that the whole enterprise was worthy but tiny, a sort of competently painted miniature. But just as most movies fade out faster than a pop song, an elite few movies have a way of aging well upon reflection. They enforce reflection by insistently bobbing back up to consciousness. A month later, everything that seemed weak about Jack Goes Boating still seems weak, but the movie's strengths are much more apparent. If one of the purposes of art is to expand our understanding of other lives - in a sense to surmount the boundaries of our own condition - Jack Goes Boating is a successful work of art. To see this movie is to feel that you've lived it. There's a beautiful shot that says it all. It's morning, and you can almost feel it - the fatigue but also the vague scent of promise that morning always brings. We see the limousine yard where Jack (Hoffman) begins each day, and in the background, looming behind, the magnificent New York skyline. This is the New York life: You look up and know that somewhere, right there, very close by, people are doing important things. Then you look down and there you are, a pair of old shoes facing another 12-hour shift. Jack is a single guy with not much going on. He's fat as hell (let's face it) and easily tongue-tied, but his friends, a couple played by Daphne Rubin-Vega and John Ortiz, fix him up with the one single woman they know (Amy Ryan). And when that goes reasonably well, he starts getting more interested in life - in the possibility of boating, in learning how to swim, in learning how to cook for company and in possibly getting a job with the transit authority. We see the ambition underlying these lives, as well as some of the ugliness that constitutes pleasure - so much marijuana, so much cocaine for such middle-aged people. As the object of Jack's affections, Amy Ryan is as good at playing a nice, working-class hometown girl as she was playing a working-class lowlife in Gone, Baby, Gone.  Jack Goes Boating won't exactly change your life, but, in a small but definite way, it will expand your experience. -- Advisory: Lots of drug use and strong language.",1
"Comedy. Directed by and starring Fiona Gordon, Dominique Abel and Bruno Romy. (Not rated. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)One's enjoyment of The Fairy depends a lot on knowing why it's worth seeing. It's a comedy with two or three big laughs, but it's not side-splitting. Nor does it have a particularly compelling story. Its appeal is rather in watching people who have devised their own original style of comic performance and have taken it to a rare level of refinement. The romance of a hotel clerk (Dominique Abel) and a mental patient (Fiona Gordon) - she thinks she is a fairy who can grant wishes - becomes the clothesline for a series of methodically planned and meticulously executed comic bits. Abel and Gordon, who also wrote and directed the picture (along with Bruno Romy), have their antecedents in American silent film and Jacques Tati's comedy, but they've come up with something that is very much their own thing. They look alike. Abel was born in Belgium, and Gordon was born in Australia, but they look like brother and sister, with rangy dancers' bodies and faces that have just a touch of Dr. Seuss in them. Their comedy has a presentational feel about it, almost like vaudeville, with hints of the circus, dance and Cirque du Soleil. There are elements of absurdity and of identification with the outsiders of the world, but with none of the sentimentality that usually goes with those qualities.  These people do not go for the tear and the smile. They go for the smile. You'll find in The Fairy neither the steampunk art direction nor the forced and syrupy zaniness of a lesser Jean-Pierre Jeunet movie (Micmacs, Delicatessen). Abel and Gordon engage the mind, they surprise and they impress. It's all very confident and expert. They know they don't have to do anything but what they do, and the audience will respond.  You might not love it; it might not be your thing, but you'll come away with no doubt that these people have this thing honed. Seeing Abel and Gordon is like finally seeing the real version of something you've previously only seen imitated. They are as in control of the comic tone as they are of their movements - and they move beautifully. ",1
"Comedy. Starring Aubrey Plaza, Jake M. Johnson and Mark Duplass. Directed by Colin Trevorrow. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Safety Not Guaranteed, a big hit at this year's Sundance Film Festival, is exactly what independent films should be yet rarely are. It's brisk and assured and never begs the audience's indulgence. No time is wasted. The movie is, at every moment, either funny or pushing the story forward, or both.  At the same time, it's original and odd in the best of ways. It takes as a jumping-off point a real-life advertisement, spotted by screenwriter Derek Connolly, in which someone was looking for a companion for a time-traveling expedition. From that material an imaginative comedy is spun, about a magazine writer (Jake M. Johnson) and two interns, a depressive young woman (Aubrey Plaza) and a shy young man (Karan Soni), who go in search of the guy who wrote the ad. Plaza, in her first major big-screen role, creates a warm portrait of a woman whose sullen and sardonic personality just barely conceals a sensitive and questing nature. Posing as someone answering the ad, she gets to know the man who placed it, and he's a genuinely odd character - a basement inventor, a gun enthusiast and a paranoid.  Indeed, if there is one thing ever-so-slightly off about the movie, it's that the would-be time traveler is perhaps a bit too crazy. When he starts waving guns around, for example, it's hard to believe that she'd continue to research the story. Under Colin Trevorrow's direction, Mark Duplass plays the role straight, as he should - he has little choice - but one does sense an actor and a director feeling their way over imperfections and rough areas in the script. Yet ultimately this becomes a small concern. Much of the appeal of Safety Not Guaranteed derives from the filmmakers' sense of proportion. Some of this can be found in Connolly's writing, some in the attention and detail of Trevorrow's direction, but there is, throughout, an understanding that every character is of interest, and that each of their journeys is important.  In a sense, everyone in the movie is on a search. The inventor wants to go back in time literally and speaks with lyrical delicacy about hearing a song dating from an earlier, happier time in life. Meanwhile, the journalist wants to go back in time emotionally. He wants to take up with a former girlfriend, and he wants to be the catalyst for other people's great memories. As the journalist, Johnson's performance is the film's most sophisticated, in that it suggests things that the actor knows, but the character doesn't.  The filmmakers are shrewd enough to leave him in a state of suspension, close to embracing his own magnificence and throwing off his undermining self-hatred, but not there yet. This is a fun and funny little movie, but the level of perception at work here is superior. ‌‌",1
"Comedy. Starring Catherine Deneuve, Gerard Depardieu and Fabrice Luchini. Directed by Francois Ozon. In French with English subtitles. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The latest from director Francois Ozon (8 Women, Swimming Pool) takes a 30-year-old comedy and turns it into a love poem to Catherine Deneuve. In a way, Potiche is a trifle: Set in 1977, it adopts a candy-box color palette that evokes the fluffy comedies of the late '60s and early '70s. It's funny, broad and never stops moving. It's made to please, and succeeds.  But it's also the movie that Deneuve has been heading toward for the better part of two decades. Once the cinema's ice goddess, Deneuve has become less guarded, less cold and less certain in her screen incarnations, and Potiche completes that work. In the comical opening minutes, we see Deneuve on a morning jog through the woods, communing with the birds and the animals and writing poetry, before arriving back at her house ... which turns out to be on a huge compound. The woods are her backyard.  The word potiche translates into English as trophy wife, though in French the word seems to have an extra implication of complete uselessness. At the start of the film, Deneuve is the sheltered wife of a factory owner (Fabrice Luchini), an umbrella maker who is in the midst of a labor dispute with his workers. He doesn't take her seriously, and neither do her kids. But when the boss is taken hostage by his employees, Suzanne (Deneuve) is forced to step in and run the factory - and things begin to change. A great strength of Ozon's adaptation is that we know, within 10 minutes, where the movie wants to go, so instead of getting there over the next 90 minutes, he streamlines the story and gets there within a half hour - and then builds and changes direction and finds ways to surprise us. Gerard Depardieu plays a leftist politician who shares a past with Suzanne, and his scenes with Deneuve are inflected with a tender acknowledgment of the movies they made when they were young.  The supporting cast is peerless, with Fabrice Luchini, usually funny and sympathetic even at his most aggressive, playing it straight here as Suzanne's bitter husband; and Karin Viard, usually a headliner, lending her star wattage to a subordinate role as the husband's hapless secretary.  But mainly Potiche will be remembered for bringing out Deneuve's comic ability, as well as qualities of warmth, wisdom and maternal concern - elements she has shown a lot of in recent years, but here they are all part of the same package. By the end, you could almost say the movie is about Deneuve herself, or at least the place she holds in the mind of the French public - and to some degree, throughout the world. -- Advisory: Strong language, sexual situations.",1
"Comedy. Starring Gianni Di Gregorio, Valeria De Franciscis, Marina Cacciotti and Maria Cali. Directed by Gianni Di Gregorio. In Italian with English subtitles. (Not rated. 74 minutes. At the Clay, Shattuck and Lark.)From its first minutes, Mid-August Lunch establishes a special tone and quality that could only be Italian. It's a mixture of warmth and gentle farce, tender observation and absurdity. A man who appears to be in his late 50s cares for his very elderly mother, and it's clear from the first minutes that he's an exemplary son but also something of a likable good-for-nothing when it comes to paying bills and making a living. In a similar way, the old ladies who become the focus of the film are comically idiosyncratic, and yet you'd have trouble finding another movie with such unforced appreciation of its elderly characters or such intelligent understanding of old age.Gianni Di Gregorio, who has worked off and on in the Italian film industry since the 1980s, usually as a screenwriter, made this film at 58 - his first as a director. He also chose to star in it, even though he has never headlined a movie, and this is only his second screen credit. To make things seemingly more difficult, he hired a cast of non-professionals. And yet, from the subtlety of the humor and the specificity of the vision, you'd think that Di Gregorio has been writing and directing his own movies for 20 years. In Italy, this film is called Pranzo di ferragosto, a title that doesn't quite translate into English, any more than Fourth of July Barbecue would translate into Italian. Ferragosto is a huge Italian holiday (Aug. 15), which has been celebrated since the time of Augustus Caesar. Businesses shut down, and everyone goes away to the countryside or to the beach.But Gianni (Di Gregorio), who owes money to everybody, is stuck in Rome with his mother (Valeria De Franciscis) for the holiday. And because he's in no position to say no, he agrees to watch the property manager's mother, Marina (Marina Cacciotti), for the weekend, and Marina brings Aunt Maria (Maria Cali) with her. Later, Gianni's doctor barters a house call in exchange for letting his mother, Grazia (Grazia Cesarini Sforza), stay at the condo. So Gianni finds himself caring for four women, each a strong personality with particular needs. Lurking underneath the surface of Mid-August Lunch is a touch of sadness that these vivid ladies are getting dumped by their families. Yet this is submerged by the ways in which the women overcome personality differences to forge their own relationships and make their own celebration. Watching them, you'd think they were experienced farceurs, and yet this is the first time any of them have appeared onscreen. There's a lot going on in this little gem. There are observations about Italian men and their mothers, about the comic ironies of life and about the needs of old age - all of it filtered through a warm, humane consciousness. Di Gregorio may be a late bloomer, but he's found his calling.",1
"Comedy. Starring Jason Segel, Ed Helms and Judy Greer. Directed by Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass. (R. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Duplass brothers keep making miniatures that contain universes. They seem to be casual, but they're dead serious. They seem to be stumbling around finding stories by accident, but their movies are thematically rigorous. They seem to be presenting matters of little consequence, but the stakes are always huge and life-changing.  It would do them no good at all to start thinking of themselves as great filmmakers, but with Jeff, Who Lives at Home, it may be time for audiences to start thinking that way. At the very least, it might alert viewers not to mistake style for substance. The first thing you see in Jeff is a guy in his 30s (Jason Segel), sitting on a couch getting stoned on a weekday afternoon. But there is nothing slack about the storytelling mechanism, which invisibly kicks into gear within the first 30 seconds.  Jeff takes place over the course of a few hours that become crucial in the lives of four people. Jeff is unemployed and depressed, but good-natured and in search of something meaningful in life. His older brother, Pat (Ed Helms), is his opposite. He is angry and emotionally unaware, and his marriage - to Linda (Judy Greer) - is near collapse. Meanwhile, Jeff and Pat's mother (Susan Sarandon) is in a kind of late-middle-age malaise, feeling as if her life is almost over and nothing much has happened. Now, notice this, because it's a big deal: Every character in the movie is suffering from an interior problem, not a problem in the external world that can be taken on and solved through action. That means that their problems are hard to depict. Give these four characters to any other filmmaker, and you would get back an earnest but very boring movie. But the Duplass brothers find ways to activate these characters. They find ways - believable ways - to throw them into active situations. Through these situations, the characters don't directly confront their problems, yet it's through a series of actions that changes come. It's a brilliant sleight of hand: Nothing important seems to be happening, and yet stuff keeps happening, and the movie is always pushing forward. Jeff, Who Lives at Home contains more in 83 minutes than most 2 1/2-hour movies. The dominoes start falling when Jeff leaves his Baton Rouge, La., home to buy wood glue. Segel gives us a character who is funny in his haplessness, but is so clearly damaged and fundamentally decent that he is not an object of scorn. It's a real performance and a lovely one. While out and about, he runs into his older brother, played by Helms as so wound up and in pain that he can't let in the outside world, not even his wife. Watching Helms, you can almost feel physically his confusion and tension. As for Sarandon, who spends most of the movie sitting at a desk on the telephone, she hasn't been shown to such good advantage in years. She plays a woman who still wants adventure, and Sarandon lets us know that this is someone worthy of adventure and who still has adventure in her future. Eventually, Jeff, Who Lives at Home lands in a place of grandeur, human scale, but grand nonetheless. Along the way, Jas Shelton's restless cinematography - documentary in style, hovering in place, using quick zooms for emphasis - is the perfect analogue to the Duplasses' vision. The characters may be tired, but the camera knows that something important is going on.",1
"Comedy. Starring Jennifer Aniston, Adam Sandler, Brooklyn Decker and Nicole Kidman. Directed by Dennis Dugan. (PG-13. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It had been one of the minor inducements to longevity, this crazy hope of one day actually seeing Jennifer Aniston in a good movie. That day arrives with Just Go With It, a very funny romantic comedy that nicely combines Adam Sandler's acerbic sweetness with Aniston's down-to-earth warmth - and that finds an excuse for Aniston to both play an average person and yet dress like a movie star. The screenplay has a setup that borders on farce, but the romantic heart of it is strong and expresses something unusual. It's a movie about the romance of familiarity, about the satisfaction and spiritual necessity of actually knowing someone and being known. So much of movie romance is usually about the opposite of that, about going off into the unknown, about adventure in the form of, not physical danger, but emotional danger. Just Go With It makes a feint in that direction, but not enough to fool anybody. The fun begins with a lie. Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who is crazy about a young woman he meets at a party (Brooklyn Decker) and finds himself lying to her about his marital status. He's a bachelor, but for some dumb reason (not worth going into) he tells her that he's in the process of getting a divorce. Suddenly needing a woman to pretend to be his soon-to-be ex-wife, he turns to his assistant (Aniston), and from there the lies snowball into fake kids and a fake new boyfriend for the fake ex-wife. Sandler has come into his own in middle age - he has gone from comic to straight man, and reacting to other people's antics and idiocies suits him. Aniston remains a remarkably natural actress: Watching her in the early scenes, in the office with Sandler, you'd almost think there wasn't a script. Her technique is seamless; her focus on the other actor, complete. It's like a quality of unusual humility that translates into talent. Later, dressed as a rich man's wife and pretending to be a castrating spouse, she's inspired.  Decker, known for posing in Sports Illustrated, spends a lot of time in a bikini, enough so that the visual begins to lose all impact, which is probably the movie's intention. To her credit, Decker lends the character a certain kindheartedness that feels genuine. Still the hands-down find of Just Go With It is 11-year-old Bailee Madison, as Aniston's daughter, who is bubbling with energy, wit and invention, a 40-year-old trapped in a child's body. Nicole Kidman appears in a featured role, as a nightmare of pretension who resurfaces in Aniston's life. The bits keep coming: A scene in which a man must revive a sick sheep is especially funny for the sheep's clearly made of rubber. But all the jokes, as well as the beauty of the location - Hawaii - can't distract from the movie's main spectacle, which concerns one enviable guy's having to choose between two beautiful woman. If you're a man, part of the experience of Just Go With It will inevitably consist of making that choice for him, in your own head. Female viewers will only have Sandler, which, under the circumstances, seems less than fair. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and partial nudity.",1
"Comedy. Starring Lake Bell, Demetri Martin and Fred Melamed. Directed by Lake Bell. (R. 93 minutes.) With this week, the summer movie season officially winds down. All the best blockbusters, or the ones thought to be the best, have already been released, and we're in that in-between time, before the prestige fall season kicks in. This period is traditionally known as something of a dumping ground, but it can also be a safe haven for good, small films looking for a window in which to blossom and find an audience. In this category, there are two movies popping up next week - more on those later - and one this week: In a World ..., a comedy written, directed and starring Lake Bell. For starters, it's a movie to make you happy to see the next movie written, directed and starring Lake Bell. She has an engaging presence and has a distinct comic sensibility. Anyone who saw any movie trailers in the previous decade will recognize those words - in a world - as the trademark opening of Don LaFontaine, the king of movie trailer announcers, who died in 2008. In this film, Lake Bell plays Carol, the daughter of another voice-over artist (Fred Melamed). Carol works as a voice coach but hopes to break into commercials and, if possible, movie trailers. But trailers are a distant dream because, if you've noticed, they have been, since the coming of sound, an almost exclusively male domain. In a World ... has the relaxed, unhurried feeling of a European movie, but with a tighter structure, so that things move along even as Bell seems to be taking her time. Bell gives details of Carol's relationship with her family, and her family's relationship with each other, and it all just flows in a likable and pleasing way. Bell has an intuitive sense of what fits and what doesn't, and she's not afraid to throw things in if they feel right. For example, a series of scenes involving Carol's sister (Michaela Watkins) and brother-in-law (Rob Corddry) are included, even though they have nothing to do with the main thrust of the movie. But they have everything to do with the feeling of it. Along the way, we get a picture of the voice-over world, something most of us have never thought about. As in every other profession, in which good things are scarce and lucrative, there is infighting and status seeking, and everybody knows everybody else's business. Bell must be very popular, in that she was able to get some major names, such as Geena Davis, in minor roles.  But then Davis, despite not having much screen time, gets to deliver one of the movie's messages, about the importance of having a woman's voice involved in movie trailers - of the meaning of that seemingly simple thing, in the grand scheme.  That's the underlying notion of In a World ..., one repeated, in different ways, throughout. Bell is concerned with more than movie trailers, but with the way women present themselves through their voice and speech, and she has no patience for the infiltration of Valley Girl inflections into pop culture. Her point is that any way of talking that makes every phrase sound as though it ends in a question mark is a way that undermines a woman's force in the world.",1
"Comedy. Starring Robert Duvall, Michael Caine and Haley Joel Osment. Directed and written by Tim McCanlies. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) They're crazy old coots, given to sitting on their porch, sipping iced tea and taking aim at the traveling salesman who keeps sniffing around after hearing of their purported millions. Walter, abandoned by his trampy, flaky mom (Kyra Sedgwick), is spooked by the trigger-happy grumps but gradually warms to their idiosyncrasies and tales of adventure in the French Foreign Legion. Walter, having discovered mementos of Duvall's onetime exotic romance, wonders if the Legionnaire yarns aren't faked. Just because something ain't true don't mean you can't believe in it, Duvall replies -- a twisted sentiment. Boosting the movie's ahhh moments, the wacky uncles also keep a menagerie of five inseparable dogs and one pig, to which they add an aging, mail-order lion (hence the title). They'd just as soon shoot the ragged critter, but Osment, the movie's bleeding heart, begs them to spare the beast. McCanlies, the screenwriter of the animated hit The Iron Giant, makes a genial but disappointing directing debut with this coming-of-age schmaltz fest. Caine and Duvall are expert, but the movie strains too hard for cockeyed whimsy, and Osment, too old for his part, is less than convincing as a wide- eyed, impressionable naif. He's at the awkward stage, beyond childhood but not ready for young romantic leads. Most child actors don't finesse the transition -- Jodie Foster and Drew Barrymore are exceptions -- and if Osment makes any more mistakes like Secondhand Lions, he could join the sad ranks of former child stars. -- Edward Guthmann  Comedy with music. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr., Beyonce Knowles and the O'Jays. Directed by Jonathan Lynn. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . The Fighting Temptations announces its priorities from the first scene, with a gospel choir rocking the floor boards of a small church in rural Georgia. The music is glorious; the scene is exuberant and edging toward frenzy, and everyone is exultant and moving in the spirit. The Fighting Temptations is all about such musical numbers, and the rest of it is just a clothesline to hang them on. For the most part, it's a sturdy clothesline, providing, despite a few sags, a warm comic story that's fairly engaging even when no one is singing. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Darrin Hill, a New York advertising executive whose life is foundering in lies, petty fraud and unpaid debt. Partly to avoid his creditors, he heads south to attend the funeral of a beloved aunt -- and then decides to stay when he finds out there's something in it for him: His aunt's will stipulates that, if he leads the church choir in a regional competition, he will inherit stock worth $150,000. Like the similarly named Harold Hill in The Music Man, Darrin is a softhearted faker who inspires a small town to dream. But his usual pattern of taking the money and running becomes less attractive to him once he meets the woman of his dreams right there in rural Georgia. Beyonce Knowles plays a single mom who also does a sultry singing act in the town's hot spot. Knowles is the main musical attraction of the film -- she sings Fever as though she were Rita Hayworth in Gilda putting the blame on Mame, plus a number of traditional gospel tunes. The O'Jays also appear as townspeople who join the choir, and gospel legends such as Shirley Caesar and the Blind Boys of Alabama, playing themselves, also perform. Gooding doesn't sing, but his buoyant energy is in keeping with the music, and his comedic skill is considerable. He's ably supported in the New York scenes by Dakin Matthews, who plays Darrin's boss with impeccable comic timing. - This film contains a couple of mild sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle Thriller. Starring Chloe Sevigny, Connie Nielsen and Gina Gershon. Directed by Olivier Assayas. (Not rated. 117 minutes. At the Lumiere) . A thriller in need of Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd or someone else to root for, Demonlover is well-scripted, well-acted and occasionally sexy, but just isn't all that interesting. The film focuses on Diane (Connie Nielsen), who works for a huge French corporation called VolfGroup. We meet her during a plane trip, where she orchestrates the drugging and mugging of a colleague so she can take over a big account. It soon becomes apparent that Diane isn't what she seems -- nobody is in Demonlover -- and the next 110 minutes are spent following her life-or-death maneuvering with love interest Herve (Charles Berling), American businesswoman Elaine (Gina Gershon) and long-suffering assistant Elise (Chloe Sevigny). Demonlover aspires to be about sex, murder, Japanese animation and corporate game-playing -- with the women doing most of the double- and triple- crossing -- but the movie often fails to make sense. While the actors are game for wherever the plot takes them, the audience is left wondering why this collection of characters is willing to lie, rape and kill over the subject of VolfGroup's big deal -- a few bad pornographic cartoons. As the film meanders gleefully to Internet torture Web sites and other forms of sexual brutality, nobody seems shocked or concerned. Director and writer Olivier Assayas is skilled with handling actors and making a little money go far (the film manages to create the illusion that events take place in France, the United States and Japan -- even though most of it appears to have been shot in empty hotel rooms). A pivotal dinnertime confrontation between Diane and Herve is particularly nuanced, and the partially subtitled film shuffles between three languages (French, Japanese and English) without breaking stride. What Assayas lacks is the ability to make the viewer care about his characters, even as the movie takes some interesting turns. None of the main players in Demonlover seem to have families or lives outside of screwing one another over, which makes it easier to feel indifferent about their fates. Maybe it's a French thing, but all of the leads in Demonlover seem clinically depressed. After a while there's nothing for the audience to do but feel the same way.- This film contains graphic sex scenes, adult language and violence. -- Peter Hartlaub  Comedy. Starring Luke Kirby, Peter Miller, Paul Sorvino, Ginette Reno. Directed by Emile Gaudreault. Written by Steve Galluccio and Gaudreault. (R. 88 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) . The mega hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding reopened the closet doors to broad ethnic humor. That film was subtle compared with Mambo Italiano, a coming- out comedy that mines every cliche of cloistered Italian culture. But like Greek Wedding, Mambo has enough funny moments to save it. Characters smack one another on the back of the head and yell basta as cloying string music keeps telling us, These people are Italian. The movie is set in Montreal's Little Italy in the present, but it could be the 1950s, with Mama in flour-sack dresses, young women in teased hair and tight clothes, and parents smiting their foreheads because their grown sons want to move out of the house. The homosexuality of lead character Angelo (Luke Kirby) is supposed to modernize the picture, but the gay plotline seems more like a device amid all the paisano antics. Anything other would have set off Angelo's shrieking family -- at least his lover Nino (Peter Miller) is Italian. The gay element seems especially flat because the Angelo character is barely likable. First, he outs his cop lover against his wishes, then berates his parents (Paul Sorvino and Ginette Reno) for their small minds and constrained lives. Filmmaker Emile Gaudreault hasn't done enough to establish Angelo as a nice guy before the family crisis starts. The freshest moments come from the guys' respective families trying to one- up each other, even in their horror that their sons are gay. Angelo's parents engage in a heated argument with Nino's mother about who's the dominant partner in the gay couple. Sorvino and Reno bring a lived-in, bickering affection to their roles that offsets the caricatured elements. Gaudreault and co-writer Steve Galluccio pack the movie with jokes, and about half of them are at least mildly funny. There are a few humdingers, like a brief, hilarious speech at the headquarters of a gay phone help line. It's also a nice conceit that Angelo, a travel agent who dreams of being a TV writer, pens scripts that are truly terrible. Kirby has a fresh-faced appeal that sees his character through his flaws, and Miller's enigmatic quality suits a guy who might not really be gay. But the leads are required to be tortured by their homosexuality, and thus not very funny. Miller actually has more chemistry with sassy Sophie Lorain, as an alpha female out to make Nino straight: Give me an hour in the gay village, and there won't be a gay village no more. Mambo Italiano lacks any violence -- other than those smacks to the head - - and the sexuality is discreet, so the R rating must have come from its gratuitous language. Characters say the f-word like they're in Reservoir Dogs -- a curious choice for a quaint family comedy. - This film contains sexual situations, raw language. - Carla Meyer Drama. Starring Alessandra de Rossi, Dexter Doria, Gina Alajar, Amy Austria and Bryan Homecillo. Directed by Gil Portes. Written by Gil Portes, Adolfo Alix Jr. and Senedy Que. (Not rated. 105 minutes. Tagalog with English subtitles. At the Lumiere, Shattuck in Berkeley, Metro Center in Colma and the Towne 3 in San Jose.) . It's too bad only one foreign film usually gets attention at the Academy Awards. Scores of countries submit entries every year -- and every year the submissions are pared down to a select winner (this year: Nowhere in Africa) while the rest are often left behind, lucky to get any mention. Fortunately, the Philippines' 2003 entry, Small Voices, has been picked up for American distribution, giving U.S. audiences a chance to check out this movie about a young, idealistic teacher who works with children in a poor village. At times dramatic, sweet, funny and sentimental, Small Voices almost seems like a fable -- except that it's based on a real story and includes a subplot threaded with violence. Melinda Santiago (Alessandra de Rossi) faces stiff resistance from parents and fellow teachers when, shortly after taking the job, she tries to enter her class in a regional singing contest. Santiago's corrupt and cynical colleagues aren't used to someone who questions school policies and uses resolve and creative measures (like selling ice candy to villagers) to support class projects. Although Santiago's students are excited about practicing for the vocal competition, their parents say it needlessly cuts into their kids' time for house chores and farming duties. One mother threatens to take her daughter out of class because you'll (eventually) just marry and have kids. Small Voices addresses issues that transcend Filipino culture, and the setting and characters may even seem familiar to those who enjoy the work of Satyajit Ray and other directors who are considered humanist filmmakers. But Gil Portes -- a Philippine-born-and-raised director and screenwriter who now lives in New York -- includes many details that are unique, including the guerrilla insurgency that draws in the father of two students. Perhaps the biggest blemish of this touching film are the white subtitles that are occasionally hard to read. - This film contains scenes of dead bodies. -- Jonathan Curiel Drama. Starring Jamal Udin Torabi and Enayatullah. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. Written by Tony Grisoni. (R. 90 minutes. In Dari, Farsi and other languages, with English subtitles. At the Metreon.) . They're usually just nameless people cited in U.N. documents or newspaper briefs about human cargo. Whether it's Chinese immigrants caught on ships bound for America or Turks and Iraqis found in big-rig containers heading for Europe, these illegal immigrants keep risking their lives in search of a better home. With In This World, director Michael Winterbottom puts an empathetic face on the problem, dramatizing the plight of two Afghans who leave the squalor of Pakistan for the promise of London. Employing a technique more common to Iranian filmmakers than those in the West, Winterbottom puts nonactors in the main roles. In fact, the two Afghans who star in In This World are refugees whose lives mirror the ones they portray in this sensitive and illuminating work. Jamal Udin Torabi, whose character is named Jamal, and Enayatullah, whose character is named Enayat (many Afghans have just one name), lived in Pakistan when they were tabbed by Winterbottom's crew. Their lack of English and affectation give the film its realism, and so does Winterbottom's sweeping camera work, which shows the two Afghans going overland from Peshawar, Pakistan (on the border with Afghanistan), to Iran's capital, Tehran, to the mountains of Turkey and onward. The footage of peaks and open-road terrain is stunning. Make no mistake, though: While Jamal and Enayat succeed in embarking on an epic journey (thanks to paying off human traffickers), they are forced along the way to spends days in shabby, pathetic hotel rooms. Their time hiding in the backs of fruit and animal trucks isn't any better. Everywhere they go, authorities seem to be nearby. In short, Jamal and Enayat go through hell to leave conditions that are also hellish. Winterbottom's last film, the jaunty, funny 24 Hour Party People, was about Manchester's musical heyday. Where that movie showcased fame, sex, excess and narcissism, In This World profiles conditions that many Westerners would rather ignore. Winterbottom is a credit to his profession -- someone who doesn't fit easy categorization, and someone who lets his conscience dictate his projects. By humanizing an immigrant/refugee crisis that is not abating, Winterbottom does a cinematic service that happens to be damn interesting, too. - This film contains a scene of an animal killing. -- Jonathan Curiel  French romance. Starring Jeanne Moreau and Aymeric Demarigny. Directed by: Josee Dayan. Written by Josee Dayan. (Not rated. 98 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . Harold and Maude play it straight in this French -- very French -- take on an autumn/spring relationship. Legendary French actress Jeanne Moreau, whom Orson Welles once called simply the greatest actress in the world, is onscreen for virtually every second of this take on the end of the life of prolific writer Marguerite Duras. Moreau, now 75, can still command the camera. At times she glares into the lens and dares you to suggest that she can't play the romantic lead. Hey, you tell her, the rest of us are too intimidated. But her moonstruck lover, Yann (Aymeric Demarigny), seems equally overpowered by the Moreau steamroller. Some of it is the role she is playing. As shown here, Duras is a bossy, obstinate, mercurial diva whose social graces weren't improved by alcoholism. She is given to statements like I am incredibly talented. That is a fact. The idea is that Yann is so awed by her gift that he is willing to overlook everything: the difference in their ages, her moods and fits, and the loss of any sense of his own life, just to be with her. But as Yann, Demarigny looks like Harry Potter's older brother and acts like a lovesick puppy. Since he and Moreau are pretty much the entire cast, he doesn't give the Duras character much to play against. As the film drags on, and Duras' health begins to fail, their relationship seems more unlikely than ever. It seems inconceivable that this young man would put his life on hold to spend every waking moment with this jealous, possessive, combative old woman. Except, of course, that it is a true story. Yann Andrea, a college student, became so infatuated with Duras, then 65, that he wrote her as many as five letters a day for five years. When they met he moved in with her, ministered to her demons and helped to coax one last great book, The Lover from her. And then, when she died, Andrea found he had learned the writing craft from her. He wrote the novel on which this movie is based. It is a great story, but it hasn't been translated to the screen. It is never a good sign when the biographical notes have more emotional wallop than the movie. - Adult themes and drinking. -- C.W. Nevius ",1
"Comedy. Starring Sabine Azema, Emmanuelle Beart and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Directed by DanieleThompson. (Not rated. 107 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza and the Rafael Film Center in San Rafael. Dec. 7 at the Shattuck in Berkeley.) Thompson, who co-wrote the script with her son, Christopher Thompson, opens the film with a death. A violinist has died, and his elegant widow (Francoise Fabian) gathers with her three grown daughters from a previous marriage. No one's happy about the dead man's poor timing -- he croaked on Dec. 20 -- not least because the family is gearing up for an annual holiday dinner. Eldest daughter Louba (Sabine Azema) is pregnant, at 42, by her married lover. Middle child Sonia (Emmanuelle Beart) bears the pressure of Martha Stewart perfection, and the youngest, Milla (Charlotte Gainsbourg), is a bitter loner who answers her cell phone at her stepdad's burial and chafes at the notion of Christmas and its enforced frivolity. Their mother, a vain former actress, has a 25-year-old standoff with their eccentric father (Claude Rich), and the handsome depressive who lives near the father (Christopher Thompson) has a secret link to the three sisters. Director Thompson integrates these characters nicely and gives each a short monologue delivered directly to the camera. The cast is fine and the dialogue occasionally sparkles with a hard wit: Men, Milla laments, are always so inconsequential; I can't help scaring them.  But La Buche never cuts terribly deep: The tone is light, the Michel Legrand music is high in calories and the result is a very handsome, well- appointed soap opera. . This film contains raw language and adult themes. . -- Edward Guthmann Thriller. Starring Han Suk-gyu and Shim Eun-ha. Directed by Chang Youn-hyun. (Not rated. 116 minutes. In Korean with English subtitles. At the Roxie Cinema.) . Tell Me Something is a complicated and stylish Korean thriller that will make viewers' skin crawl. It has a great virtue that will be especially appreciated by those who'll depend on subtitles to understand it: It's not dialogue heavy. It's visually rich, telling its story mainly in pictures, though some of those pictures may induce a gag reflex. This jolly tale deals with an investigation into a series of macabre killings. The unseen murderer has his own signature style: He chloroforms his victim, then uses surgical instruments to cut off the arms, legs and head. According to the coroner, the killer is someone who has had medical training. He is also someone who knows how to take out the garbage. See Tell Me Something, and it may be a while before a black garbage bag again looks harmless. Black trash-bag liners start turning up in various places. In each case, someone eventually opens the bag, or the bag breaks, resulting in a big surprise. The best of these surprises comes on a crowded elevator, when a child accidentally punctures a bag with a shopping cart. Blood gushes out, followed by a head and arms. Everyone is screaming and clawing at the elevator walls. It's almost funny to imagine, but in the execution, it's horrific. There are sights in Tell Me Something that are so stomach-turning (the view of a corpse's arm sockets springs to mind) that viewers may find themselves getting angry at director Chang Youn-hyun. It's not as if the movie were serving some high artistic purpose. It's all about pressing buttons. Tell Me Something is a thriller in the Seven vein, only twice as creepy. Call it Eight -- or Fourteen. Han Suk-gyu plays a young cop who starts off the movie already burned out on his job, and by the middle he's even worse off -- burned out and having nightmares. The demure Shim Eun-ha, reportedly the biggest female star in South Korea, plays Su-Yeon, a young intern who is linked to all six victims. At one time or another, she was romantically involved with each. Knowing that Su-Yeon's boyfriends all end up headless is an impediment to romance, though a mutual attraction between the cop and the intern becomes an underlying tension, especially after Su-Yeon is ruled out as a suspect. Tell Me Something is at its most chilling in its quieter moments, creating a sense of doom and a feeling of paranoia. Every move the cop and the intern make is being watched by a killer. Meanwhile, those garbage bags are piling up as if it's a sanitation strike. Even when he's not throwing buckets of blood at his audience, director Chang knows how to build a scene, and his use of slow motion -- arbitrary in most action films -- captures the slowed-down reality that comes in moments of peak tension. The use of sound is excellent. In the action scenes it's sparing and tentative, as though fearful of the horrors on screen. In one moment of peak anxiety, Chang uses a cheerful and innocuous-sounding Shostakovich waltz to unbearable effect. This movie contains graphic gore, blood and violence. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Comedy. Starring Seann William Scott, Liev Schreiber and Alison Pill. Directed by Michael Dowse. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The gloves are off in Goon, and not only in the hockey rink, where much of the movie takes place. The gloves are off in terms of the comedy, too. All the little niceties that used to limit the scope of comedy - niceties not only of language but of philosophy - are gone. In Goon, everyone is either a moron, or morally bereft, or some classless combination of both. The movie is harsh, nasty and vulgar like you wouldn't believe. And often, it's hilarious.  This is the second comedy in the past month - the other was The FP - to recognize that the cursing in youth-oriented movies has gone so far off the charts that it's ripe for satire. Like The FP, Goon satirizes the vulgarity by amping it up. I can only imagine that for Goon screenwriters Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg, the challenge was to figure out just how many f-words they could pack into a single line of dialogue. They do a lot of packing. The movie is based on a memoir by Doug Smith, who played minor-league hockey and co-wrote a book about his experiences 10 years ago. It was a small-press book and didn't do much at the time, but the story - about a goon, a hockey player whose main function is to beat up on the other team - has been adapted and the character transformed. In his new incarnation, Doug Smith has become Doug Glatt, a good-natured idiot with two gifts: He can take a punch, and he can knock out just about anybody.  He's also Jewish, in this version, from an upper-middle-class family, which means that his mother and physician father (Eugene Levy) look at him like he's from Jupiter and find his career path mortifying, even if he is the most successful goon in the minor leagues. His father does not think this is the career path of a serious man, and he's concerned about the head injuries his son might be inflicting. Though the comedy in Goon is extreme, it's also quite specific and true to its world. For example, the central character of Doug is drawn with considerable care and acted with specificity by Seann William Scott. Doug is a sweet, humble guy, who is diffident in every other aspect of his life, for the simple reason that he never knows what to say. When he meets a girl he likes, Eva, he tells her that her name is pretty like your face. Everything he says is a little bit off, and Scott plays every moment like he wonders if he's doing or saying something wrong. It makes for a funny and a surprisingly endearing character. Alison Pill - who played Zelda Fitzgerald in Midnight in Paris - gets her first extended comic showcase as the object of Doug's affection, a self-described slut who sleeps around. She strikes just the right note, extreme yet true. A big emotional moment comes when she tells him that he makes her want to stop having sex with lots of different guys. He's touched by this: That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Along the way, almost by accident, you get a picture of Canadian hockey in the lower levels, and it's tough. It's blood sport, literally - lots of blood on the ice and some teeth, too. Liev Schreiber plays the sport's reigning goon, with a believable mix of pride and self-disgust. If this were Showgirls, Schreiber would be Gina Gershon and Scott would be Elizabeth Berkley.  Or to put it another way, the form is familiar and holds no surprises, but the particulars are different and lots of fun. And Goon doesn't overstay its welcome. It quits while it's ahead.",1
"Comedy. Starring Steve Carell and Tina Fey. Directed by Shawn Levy. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)It helps in Date Night that Tina Fey and Steve Carell really do seem married. They're about the same age. They're equally good looking. They have a benign aura, but with a sense of humor that sneaks up and stings in ways that the victim doesn't always know. And they seem very at home with each other, like old friends - or like people who have been married for a long, long time. Though Date Night doesn't aspire to be much besides being funny and providing a strong showcase for its two comedians, it does one equally important thing up-front. Before it revs up the plot machinery, it establishes the specific terms of the marriage. The Fosters live fairly well, but both have demanding jobs, and they're too exhausted to invest much in the relationship. Because they're both nice people, they feel they should invest more, and they are gentle with each other in ways that are comical and recognizable. A vacation (without the kids) might rekindle the romance, but what they really need is an adventure - one to show them different sides of themselves and each other, one to demonstrate that their marital functionality is up to challenges bigger than figuring out who drives the kids to school. Believing in Fey and Carell as a married couple gives the whole story a context. The movie takes them on a date from hell, but that date serves the true purpose of date night more than just another meal at a restaurant.Yet alongside this, there's the parallel fun - that of remembering Fey and Carell as a pair of gifted sketch comedians and of watching them ply their skill and play off their public images in concert with each other. Josh Klausner (Shrek the Third) wrote the screenplay, but it really does seem as though some of its funniest lines were ad-libbed. Either that or Klausner deserves credit for tailoring a screenplay so completely to his actors so as to make it seem that they wrote it. The movie borrows a device straight out of Hitchcock's North by Northwest. The Fosters, a New Jersey couple wanting to jazz up their date night, go to Manhattan in the hope of getting into a hot upscale restaurant. But they don't have a reservation, and they're treated like bridge-and-tunnel trash by the maitre d'. Determined to get in anyway, they take the reservation of a no-show couple and have a great meal - that almost turns into a last supper.It turns out that the no-shows - the Tripplehorns - have been targeted for death by mobsters and corrupt police. And now everyone thinks that the Fosters are the Tripplehorns. You know the evening has taken a turn when two thugs show up asking, Did you really think you could steal from Joe Miletto? It gets even scarier: Joe Miletto is played by Ray Liotta.Lots of the humor comes from the pairing of these square, eminently sane suburbanites against the madness and violence of the city slickers. There are funny lines, as when the wife worries aloud about getting whacked off by the mob - combining whacked and bumped off to get a phrase that doesn't quite mean what she thinks. And there are nice set pieces of physical comedy, as when the two are forced to pose as erotic dancers and perform in a strip club. Mark Wahlberg has an amusing featured role as a government agent who looks like an underwear model and never wears a shirt.Best of all, the filmmakers know when to pull the plug.

"Comedy. Starring Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Men will watch Crazy, Stupid, Love thinking they're finding out things about women, but if anything, this movie works the other way. Women will get a glimpse into the male mind.  So we have a newly separated man, whose wife has cheated on him, getting lessons in how to attract women, a plot element predicated on an almost universally held male belief that there are surefire secrets to be learned in this area. It's not simply a matter of chance, that there are some guys that women just like. No, it's a matter of learning how to dress and what to say. And when it's Steve Carell doing the learning and Ryan Gosling doing the teaching, there is the basis here for good comedy. Crazy, Stupid, Love aspires to be more than funny, too, to mix laughs with serious observation, with scenes showing the wronged husband coming into his authority and the local lothario (Gosling) discovering his heart. There the results are mixed. The movie's almost two-hour running time makes it almost as long as a Judd Apatow entry, without the same degree of insight or force. Crazy, Stupid, Love doesn't quite feel all of a piece, and there are awkward places in the plotting, particularly near the finish. Yet it remains entertaining and, more than that, involving, in the sense that we never doubt or lose interest in the central situation - that of a middle-aged man (Carell) forced to reassess himself and his world. Carell carries the comedy, while remaining grounded in the pain of the character, and so we care. It's also astonishing what good clothes and a haircut can do for a guy. There's a lesson in that for all of us. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman, Crazy, Stupid, Love subscribes to a very male notion that if your wife leaves you, the best way to get her respect is to have sex with nine women in quick succession. Being male myself, I would not necessarily argue with that idea - though equating romantic success with personal value means placing so much pressure on oneself that failure is almost guaranteed. Julianne Moore, as the estranged wife, does her best to be sympathetic, though it's hard to forgive her. Marisa Tomei has more fun in a featured role as a one-night stand. In a parallel story, the movie follows a newly minted lawyer, played by Emma Stone, a young actress I'm starting to worry about. Every publication these days is proclaiming her stardom before it's happened, and that's the recipe for a Julia Ormond-like fall. Yet based on her confidence, her comic timing, her idiosyncratic good looks and manner, she deserves the career everyone is predicting.",1
"Conversations With Other Women: Romantic drama. Starring Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart. Directed by Hans Canosa. (R. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This effect is distancing, often frustrating and sometimes just plain odd. Maybe frustration is the point. Maybe the idea is that the man and the woman, though together in the same room, inhabit different psychological landscapes. Or maybe not. Maybe the director just liked the effect. Most viewers won't. When two actors stand alongside each other, it's distracting to see all of one in one frame, and then a piece of that same actor showing up in the next frame. My guess is that Conversations With Other Women would have been better had Canosa taken a more conventional approach -- certainly the story would have had more emotional force. Then again, even if filmed by Richard Linklater, this story could never have achieved the lilting lyricism of the Before pictures, despite a certain similarity in structure: Like Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, the film presents us with conversation-as-seduction, a two-person conversation between a man and a woman that stretches over an evening. In the waning minutes of a New York wedding reception, an oily, attractive man (Aaron Eckhart) spots a sharp-witted, attractive woman (Helena Bonham Carter) and strikes up a conversation. She's in the wedding party, visiting from London, and he lives in New York. Over time, they come to realize that they knew each other years before. From the beginning, sex is in the atmosphere, and soon it begins to seem inevitable. The wedding, after all, is being held in a hotel, which means their getting-acquainted conversation is taking place in a building with hundreds of bedrooms. Though the split-screen gimmick is questionable, Canosa brings it off with grace and inventiveness. Sometimes both actors are in one frame, while the other shows a scene from the past or a vision of the future. In a couple of instances, both frames show the same actor doing alternative takes of the same reaction shot. The best use of the strategy is when the two face each other, and one frame shows one actor's right profile, and the other frame swings around to show the same profile of the other actor. If this all sounds too clever by half, it's not -- it's too clever by whole -- but enjoy it, because this is not a trend that's about to catch on. Besides, the script by Gabrielle Zevin is clever too, and in all the ways that word clever implies: skillful, shrewd, intelligent and just a trifle icy. Icy or not, to think back on Conversations With Other Women having seen it is to be impressed by the control that the screenwriter has over the material, how dialogue that's seemingly free-flowing is carefully calibrated to introduce a series of revelations that keeps viewers on their toes. This is entertainment by and for adults. It's about adults, as well, dealing with the romantic aspirations of two middle-aged people and their accumulated choices and regrets. Both Bonham Carter and Eckhart are good at giving us their characters' practiced surface and the truth that's underneath it. Eckhart's smile is about as engaging and thoroughly untrustworthy as that of anyone in the current cinema, and our wondering about him is part of the movie's suspense. Likewise, Bonham Carter's prickliness, as the woman, could be the indication of either strong, uncompromising character or mere irritability. -- Advisory: Strong language, nudity, convincingly realistic simulated sex.

"Crime drama. Starring Ray Stevenson, Vincent D'Onofrio, Val Kilmer and Christopher Walken. Directed by Jonathan Hensleigh. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jonathan Hensleigh, who wrote and directed Kill the Irishman, makes the case for this movie and its central character within a minute of screen time, before the opening credits roll. We see a big, rough-looking redheaded guy driving a car, listening to music - and then escaping by a split second as his car blows up. We see him pick himself off the road and yell to everyone who might be listening, It'll take more than a few firecrackers to kill Danny Green! Based on the real life exploits of a Cleveland gangster, Kill the Irishman contains many elements that will be familiar to fans of crime movies. Vincent D'Onofrio and Paul Sorvino play Italian gangsters - of course they do (of course they should) - and you will recognize more than a couple of faces from Goodfellas and The Sopranos. But what makes this film special and memorable is the character of Danny Green, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul.  On the contrary, this is the portrait of a remarkable man, who first turns to crime as an industrious person's logical response to humble origins and who grows in stature as the film wears on. It's the portrait of a guy whose courage was practically freakish. He feared nobody, but rather had a highly developed, if idiosyncratic, sense of justice that would not allow him to back down. Danny is played by Ray Stevenson (Rome), hardly a household name, and Kill the Irishman may not turn him into one. Yet within the film industry, people will be taking note of Stevenson's confidence and presence and the fact that he seems to have enough testosterone to power a city block. In a film in which everything is designed to portray its protagonist as someone extraordinary, you need an actor on a grand scale. Stevenson shows he's exactly that, physically and spiritually.  Christopher Walken shows up as a Jewish gangster, who is just like Walken in every other movie, but are you tired of him yet? I'm not. Along the way, Hensleigh nicely evokes the period - the 1960s and 1970s - not just in the accoutrements, but in the attitudes.  -- Advisory: Lots of people blowing up; they blow up good.

"D.W. Griffith called his 1915 film “The Birth of a Nation,” but what nation was being born? It wasn’t the Confederacy, whose utter defeat was depicted in the film. The “nation” being born was rather that of the Ku Klux Klan, a nation of resistance — at least in Griffith’s mind — to the dominance of the North and the rise of the freed slaves.Now, 101 years later, a black filmmaker answers Griffith with his own “The Birth of Nation.” Nate Parker takes the 1831 slave rebellion led by Nat Turner and posits that as the first shot in the Civil War, a first decisive act in bringing about the end of slavery and a new America.You can argue the historicity of that viewpoint, but for movies there is something vital here, and very 21st century. Parker’s “The Birth of a Nation” joins films such as “Django Unchained,” “12 Years a Slave” and “Free State of Jones” in depicting American slavery as an unalloyed, soul-crushing evil. This is new in movies and more than a century overdue. The upcoming film 'The Birth of a Nation' though expected to be a contender for an Oscar has an overwhelming amount of criticism weighing against it due to the reveal that its writer/director and star Nate Parker was accused of raping a woman during his stay at Penn State University. Many people are boycotting the film in protest of Parker.As a film, “The Birth of a Nation” is raw and ungainly, but it’s definitely alive. Its overall strategy is simple — to show what made Turner lead a murderous rampage and to justify it in the viewer’s mind. Yet Parker is able to find shadings and character subtleties in the course of employing that strategy, so despite a kind of action-movie overall design — i.e., he took abuse and kept taking it until he finally exploded — there’s moral nuance, the suggestion of a broader vision.For one thing, Nat Turner’s masters aren’t that bad. They’re not great, but they’re not the monsters that some slaveholders were. When Nat is a child, his intelligence becomes known to the mistress of the house (Penelope Ann Miller), and instead of feeling threatened, she teaches him to read. But she lets him read nothing but the Bible, and after promising to give him a better life, she sends him back into the cotton fields to work as a laborer.As an adult, Nat (Parker) is the favorite of his master, Sam Turner (Armie Hammer), who seems to have some basic humanity, but not so much that he can’t suppress it when his financial interests are at stake. But other masters are worse — sadists who enjoy inflicting pain, or misers who keep their slaves on concentration-camp rations, or sexually depraved monsters who really don’t care about right or wrong. While still in bondage, Nat becomes a preacher, and when he is brought to preach on other plantations, his eyes are opened to the suffering of his people.I suppose the mention of sex must lead us to at least acknowledging the atmosphere of controversy surrounding Parker as his film goes into release. He was tried for rape in 1999 and cleared of all charges. I can only say this is not something I thought about while watching the film, though a rape scene is featured prominently, as the decisive precipitating incident in Nat’s radicalization. Others may feel otherwise, but now we’re getting outside the domain of film criticism.As Nat, Parker starts the film as smart, sensitive and seemingly passive, wanting to go through life with his head down, bothering nobody. But things keep happening. If there’s a common thread in most of these incidents, it’s that they show how slavery makes basic human dignity impossible. To be a man and yet be unable to protect your family is to live a nightmare. To accept that is to be broken. So what other option is there but rebellion, even in the face of hopelessness?This presentation of the slave’s plight in emotionally complicated and psychologically rich terms is the key to the film’s value. It shows, in ways that seize the imagination, that slavery offered no possibility of pride in work or identity, no sense of security or safety, not even the comfort of personal relationships, because even those were under threat.“12 Years a Slave” is in most ways superior to “The Birth of a Nation,” but the thing this new film makes vivid — not just intellectually understood, but felt on a gut level — is important. It shows what a horrible thing slavery was even if you could stand the work and even if the master wasn’t cruel. By taking his time, by making most of his film about the lead-up to the rebellion, Parker lures us into an internal apprehension of the slave’s experience, a roiling cauldron of rage, humiliation and helplessness.If you see “The Birth of a Nation,” do give some thought afterward to what it might have been, an action drama in which the villains got the wrong guy angry. This is something much more sophisticated, a two-hour walk in a slave’s shoes. It takes a condition that we have all thought about historically, politically and even dramatically and makes us actually feel it and live it. That’s a serious achievement. ",1
"DEATH TO SMOOCHY: Starring Robin Williams, Edward Norton and Catherine Keener. Directed by Danny DeVito. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Death to Smoochy, we don't get Williams' usual tear and a smile, just sneers and bile, and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing. Williams' performance alone would put Death to Smoochy in the plus column, but the movie also benefits from the amiable silliness of Edward Norton in the title role and from Danny DeVito's high-velocity direction. This is screwball film noir, if such a genre could be imagined. Williams plays children's TV star Rainbow Randolph, a drunk with weird sexual proclivities who is caught taking bribes and fired. Looking for someone squeaky-clean to replace him, the kids' TV network settles on Sheldon, an impossibly earnest small-timer who works the hospital and rehab circuit as the folk-singing Smoochy the Rhino. Adam Resnick's screenplay takes the wise strategy of not making Smoochy insufferable or sanctimonious. As played by Norton, Smoochy is instead a sweet, principled guy who wants to use his position not to sell action figures or sugary cereals but to encourage good nutrition and healthy family relations. This leads to some funny excesses -- for example, a children's song whose chorus is My step-dad's not mean, he's just adjusting. This also puts him at odds with the show's cynical producer, Nora, whom Catherine Keener plays with her usual shrewd wit and sensitivity. After establishing a comic situation, with Smoochy thriving and Rainbow Randolph sinking into poverty and madness, the movie seems about to go off track about a third of the way in. We're introduced to two sets of underworld characters -- the Irish mafia and a corrupt children's organization -- and it all starts to feel like too much of everything other than Williams and Norton. But the picture rescues itself, partly because Resnick's screenplay belabors nothing. In Smoochy, once it becomes clear that something will happen, it happens, immediately. The result is a story that's always unfolding, generously piling on twists and turns and reversals. One gets the sense that the writer loved the world of the film and enjoyed delving into its intricacies. Credit must also go to DeVito, who has a smart director's intuition for when his audience is beginning to pull back and lose interest. DeVito (who also plays Smoochy's manager) blasts through the cumbersome expository scenes so he can linger on what the audience really wants to see, which is Williams and Norton. Williams basks in the freedom not to be innocuous. Randolph hits the skids, walking the New York streets in the middle of the night, talking to himself, indulging in revenge fantasies, a repellent extrovert with an audience of zero. When he does speak to someone, he flies off the handle, providing Williams with opportunities to be brilliant. Just one little example of many: In the midst of halfheartedly trying to convince someone that Smoochy is gay and a Nazi, he lets his hand fly up, as if involuntarily, in a fey Nazi salute. Even in scenes where Williams is not being as obviously inventive, his attack on his lines is in itself comical. Randolph's anger and vulgarity know no bounds. In one scene, he has to walk from a courthouse to an automobile, surrounded by reporters, and his ferociousness is side-splitting. The mask is off this kiddie idol. The sense that, in some way, Williams may be poking fun at himself -- or his own image as a children's icon -- makes the moment all the more rich. . This film contains violence, sexual situations and strong language. ",1
"DEEP BLUE SEA: Sci-fi horror. Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane and LL Cool J. Directed by Renny Harlin. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Any one of a dozen movies out there shows actors chewing the scenery. Deep Blue Sea shows the scenery chewing the actors, and not just nibbling. In one particularly delightful shot, a shark starts chomping on a man, and another shark comes over and munches on him too. It's intimate, like sharing gum. Action director Renny Harlin -- who has to be accepted as a real talent in his sphere -- spends the first half-hour fooling the audience into thinking it's watching another dull, earnest adventure movie. Saffron Burrows plays a researcher trying to cure Alzheimer's disease by harvesting brain fluid from sharks. Fine. Any reason will do, so long as they send in the sharks. Samuel L. Jackson plays a financier who comes to spend a night at the researchers' elaborate underwater laboratory. (Mistake.) They're the usual band of merry, scruffy geniuses. Like the ones in Anaconda, like the ones in Twister, like the ones in Dante's Peak . . . The interior walls of the laboratory have the bluish look of diseased limbs in a medieval torture painting. But it takes a while for the movie to reveal its own taste for extremes. A man squats by a shark tank and lights a cigarette. At that moment a shark leaps up and bites off his arm. It is a profound anti-smoking statement. Deep Blue Sea is up and running. With an audacious combination of playfulness and wickedness, the movie takes two minutes to blow up everyone and everything unpromising. The film's course is transformed. Forget Alzheimer's. The survivors are trapped inside the underwater complex like meat in a tin can. Outside are 25-foot can openers. That's the whole story: Deep Blue Sea is an all-night eating binge, told from the standpoint of the food. The science-fiction hook is that these are not mere sharks. These are genius sharks, genetically engineered to have massive brains. To survive, the people have to figure out what the sharks are planning. What does a 25-foot mako shark with a brain the size of a V-8 engine and no natural predators think about? asks Jackson in one of the more droll moments. Jackson is the only marquee name, but the cast lacks for nothing in talent and appeal. Rapper LL Cool J, who has been on the periphery of the movie business for several years, has the juiciest role as a preacher turned cook. He spends a good deal of the movie fighting a shark on his own, hiding in an oven in one scene while the shark strikes the glass. This is the third film that British model- turned-actress Saffron Burrows has made, and she still hasn't smiled. But she is one of the few young actresses who comes across as believable as a brilliant scientist. Thomas Jane, who made a name as Neal Cassady in the independent The Last Time I Committed Suicide, is a virile leading man, with blond good looks and a Don Johnson-like drawl. Of course, the sharks are also stars, and whether actual, animatronic or computer-generated, they look real in Deep Blue Sea. In fact, they look more than real. They have personality. When they show their teeth, they're not just getting ready for dinner. They're smiling. These sharks are smart enough to be in on the joke.  .. ",1

Jedi” brings something new to the “Star Wars” franchise: an exceptional performance.All “Star Wars” movies end up being remembered, and this one is going to be remembered for Mark Hamill. Here’s an actor who has spent a long time living with Luke Skywalker, being the guy who was in those movies, getting older, getting used to it, rebelling against it, carving out a place inside his head where he can have his own identity. And all of those 40 years of coming to terms with being Luke find their way into this performance.The movie begins maybe five or 10 minutes after “The Force Awakens” ended. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke on a remote rock of a planet, where he has lived like a hermit for long time. The last movie ended with the suggestion that Luke is the heavy artillery, the Jedi master who is about to get into the fight. But “The Last Jedi” immediately takes a different direction.Luke isn’t interested. He wants no part of any star wars. He may have seemed like a contemplative philosopher at the end of the last episode, but don’t let the gray whiskers fool you. He’s a bitter guy, who looks like Rutherford B. Hayes on a three-day drunk, and he’s filled with self-loathing, cynicism and regret. He looks like what 40 years can do to a person, and the gung-ho kid of yore is nowhere to be found on that face.Behind the scenes: Star Wars: The Last JediHamill is completely without compromise here. There’s no twinkle peeking out from between the stern words. There are no new lessons for the veteran to learn, because he has already learned them all, and they have led him to this miserable, solitary existence. What a brilliant turn by writer-director Rian Johnson to land Luke Skywalker in such a way, and what a committed piece of acting by Hamill, who gives this everything he has.As for the rest of the movie, it’s pretty good, not quite in the same league as “The Force Awakens,” but an improvement over “Rogue One.” It has the feel and atmosphere of a “Star Wars” movie and gets pulses going with a strong opening sequence, in which Poe (Oscar Isaac), who always needs a shave, leads a ragtag group of fighters against a fleet of elite starships.The Resistance faces steep odds throughout “The Last Jedi.” Basically, they’re losing the whole time. Still, they have one big advantage over the evil empire, and that comes under the category of faulty construction. Apparently every single device, ship or Death Star created by the Empire operates in a way that, if you just happen to hit one vulnerable spot, the entire thing blows up. Their engineers have just never quite figured a way around that.The Empire’s Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is a large, cadaverous entity with an evil English accent and a long scar on his head that looks like he tried scalp reduction surgery and it just didn’t take. His lieutenant is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is just back from killing his own father, Han Solo. Ren doesn’t feel all that great about what he did. He thinks he probably did the right thing, but he’s just not sure. In a series of telepathic communications, Rey senses the good within him, even if the audience has no idea what she’s seeing.The official trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.“The Last Jedi” has lots of moving parts, but the action mainly surrounds a couple of ambivalent men, Ren and Luke, and a couple of determined women, Rey and Gen. Leia, who are trying to save the galaxy. It’s good to see Carrie Fisher again, alive through the magic of film. She looks a bit frail, a bit worn down, but then one of the running themes of “The Last Jedi” is the toll that endless conflict takes on the survivors, who live with the awful knowledge that victories are never final. Fisher is the soul of this series, and it’s hard to imagine who could ever take her place.The skillful plotting of “The Last Jedi” means there are lots of surprises, big and small. Whenever you think you know how things will play out, the movie pulls a reversal. Characters take turns being right and being wrong. Nobody knows everything. Johnson is likewise very smart in knowing when to play up the traditional “Star Wars” elements and when to spoof them. For example, Domhnall Gleeson plays a starched Empire general, and just when you’re sure the movie is descending into accidental parody, Johnson reveals the character as intentionally ludicrous.As is often the case with “Star Wars,” a certain battle fatigue begins to set in after two hours, but Johnson possesses an instinct for when he has gone over his limit, and he varies or scales back on the space battles each time he needs to. In any case, it helps that Fisher, Hamill and to an extent Ridley ground the action in deeply wrought emotion.You don’t see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late-middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it’s all about and whether any of it was worth it. It’s this element that gives “The Last Jedi” an extra something, a fascinating melancholy undercurrent. ",1
"Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplays for scores of movies, but he probably never wanted or expected to live a drama worthy of one. And then life intruded, in the form of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and he was faced with a crisis that tested everything he had — his will, his talents, his finances, his faith and his family. He had to become as strong as the hero of a movie, or fall to pieces.You can see “Trumbo,” a feature film about the screenwriter’s life during the Hollywood blacklist, as the movie that Trumbo earned through years of suffering. He could have had it worse. Were he an actor, he could not have worked at all, while as a writer he did piece together an income by writing screenplays through fronts and aliases. Even so, as the movie shows, the strain and anxiety of those years were prodigious, and they make us contemplate what others went through who weren’t quite so strong, or talented, or prolific.Directed by Jay Roach, best known as a comedy director (“Meet the Fockers,” and the “Austin Powers” movies), and written by the TV writer John McNamara, “Trumbo” is breezy and pithy without ever undercutting the seriousness of the subject. A certain degree of wit is appropriate in a writer’s story, just as any Hollywood tale must have at least a whiff of absurdity, or else it can’t be true. “Trumbo” gives us comically outsize characters and yet never lets us see that some of these grand-scale, borderline comic figures were out to destroy each other.Bryan Cranston is not the most likely candidate to play Trumbo, who was more acerbic and mercurial than Cranston, and more of a dandy. Cranston hunches over and tries to make himself shorter, and he adopts Trumbo’s speech patterns, but the fit is never quite seamless. You can always see the actor working. However, Cranston’s connection with Trumbo’s struggle and frustration, and with his streak of canny practicality, couldn’t be stronger. Anyone who saw “Breaking Bad” knows that Cranston can play a proud, intelligent man under financial pressure, looking for creative ways to support his family.Trumbo was late to the party — the Communist Party — joining in 1943, while most of his intellectual colleagues joined in the period between the start of the Great Depression and Stalin’s purges in the late 1930s. As the movie shows, he was a vocal liberal who would never cross a picket line and loved to talk about left-wing causes. Thus, when the political climate in the United States changed after World War II, he was among the first group of Hollywood figures to come under suspicion.“Trumbo” revels in the craziness of the period. Helen Mirren plays gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, a rabid right-winger who wore a new hat every day and used her massive readership to terrorize studio executives and enforce the blacklist. She was joined in her efforts by actor John Wayne (David James Elliott), who blossomed into a super-patriot just late enough to sit out the entire Second World War. These are practically cartoon figures, and yet they’re played with nuance: Mirren gives us a sadist, but one driven by sincere conviction; and Elliott suggests that Wayne couldn’t help but feel more of a personal connection with liberal fellow actors than with right-wing journalists.With all the larger-than-life entities roaming the Earth at the time, one wonders why the screenwriter felt the need to resort to the fictional character of Arlen (Louis C.K.), a Hollywood writer and fellow communist, who serves as a composite of several of Trumbo’s more hard-line political friends. Louis C.K. is more than fine in the role, but the added fiction feels like an unnecessary concession, especially when we see real-life figures such as Edward G. Robinson (Michael Stuhlbarg) expressing concern over “Arlen.” Arlen is a reminder, however, that Trumbo had a comparatively good blacklist period; that is, as good as it got. It is the tendency of American movies to deal only with success, even in the midst of disaster. If we make a movie about 9/11, it’s about five or six people who survived the building collapse. Even our Holocaust movies tend to be about people who got away. “Trumbo” is in that great American tradition, but it hints at the abyss, the crater that was on all sides of Trumbo, and of the other lives, professional and otherwise, that never came back.",1

Starring Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Directed by Sam Mendes. (PG-13. 143 minutes.) Part of the romance of James Bond, what has kept it thriving for 50 years, is that the Bond life has seemed enviable: sex and danger and thrills and beautiful women and exotic locations and great clothes ... but not this time. Skyfall is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One Skyfall is enough.  Put simply, James Bond's life is garbage. He can't seem to leave the house without getting shot. He has a drinking problem. His boss, M (Judi Dench), seems to be failing at her job, and physically, he's not what he used to be. For the first half hour, Craig goes through the movie unshaven, and the white stubble around the chin isn't flattering. What's more, much is made of Bond's advancing age, which seems unfair, as Craig is only 44 - that is, a year younger than Roger Moore was when he made his first Bond movie. But that's how it is at middle age: If you smile you look young, and if you don't, you look old. But wait, you might say, surely this Bond has something to smile about. For example, what about the Bond girls? Every Bond movie has at least one, a mysterious woman who puts Bond in danger, until they team up, two against the world, to do battle against the forces of darkness. And it's true, there is most certainly a Bond girl in Skyfall. Her name is Judi Dench.  Yes, there are two other women in the movie, and they are the ostensible romantic interests. Naomie Harris plays a colleague with whom Bond has a somber frolic. And then there's Berenice Marlohe, who looks like Eva Green, smokes like Eva Green and is French like Eva Green. But she doesn't have anything near the part that Green had in Casino Royale. Really, she only has one important scene, which she delivers well, playing a woman pretending to be the soul of cool, while terrified.  So it's Dench who occupies that central place in the film's structure and in Bond's affections, and this does a number of things, none of them good. First, it replaces a sexual relationship with a mother-son type relationship, less fun for all concerned. Second, it forces an already subdued Bond into a mode of dutifulness and subordination; that is, it turns a bad boy into a good son. Dull. Finally, it throws the emphasis on M, who was fine in small doses, but under scrutiny, seems rather sour and ungiving, and a pretty cold Mommy as mother figures go. Moreover, the evidence suggests that M is an incompetent administrator. Still, just taken as action film and not as an entry into the James Bond canon, Skyfall is entertaining and fast-moving, with a well-constructed sequence involving a car chase, a shootout, a motorcycle chase and a duel to the death on top of a train - all before the opening credits. Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins provide the film with elegance and polish, including a number of shots that are eye-catching and some that are more than that. For example, the sight of Bond, as seen from behind, as he turns into a silhouette in the frame of a doorway. Or better yet, the introduction of the villain (Javier Bardem), who, seen at first from a distance, slowly walks toward the camera, as he calmly tells a story. Bardem is another of the film's assets, nicely embodying a villain who is giddy and brilliant and easily as happy as Bond is miserable. Bardem owns every scene he's in, though the screenplay makes ill use of him: Instead of having a grievance against Bond, he has a grievance (a legitimate one, at that) against M. So once again Bond is a bystander. This had better not be a trend. Daniel Craig is still the second-best Bond ever, but he is falling into the Timothy Dalton trap of emphasizing the darker aspects of the character and blocking out the light. It says something when you leave a Bond movie feeling nostalgic for the radiant self-satisfaction of the Roger Moore Bond. Craig's Bond could use some cheering up.",1
"Dark Blue: Drama. Starring Kurt Russell, Scott Speedman and Ving Rhames. Directed by Ron Shelton. (R. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Actually, it takes more than a few weeks. Yet, while Dark Blue may not be easy to watch, it's exceptionally well made. Unmistakably authentic -- and all the more disturbing for that reason -- it presents violence not with the usual movie-style theatricality but with the graphic abruptness of real life as captured on a surveillance video. Likewise, while many movies strive to imitate the gutter bonhomie of cops and crooks, the dialogue in this film's screenplay -- written by David Ayer, from a story by James Ellroy -- hits the ear as real. Dark Blue is set in Los Angeles in the days leading up to the riots following the Rodney King verdict in 1992. It's directed by Ron Shelton, who is best known for his sports films (Bull Durham, White Men Can't Jump, Cobb, Tin Cup). While his new film has a decidedly darker atmosphere, Shelton's years of service in the towel-snapping realms come in handy: The police and criminals exist here in what is pretty much a men's world, and the worst among them seem to think it's all a game. That's certainly the attitude of Eldon, a police sergeant in a special investigations division, played by Kurt Russell with a joie de vivre -- or joie de mort -- that makes him magnetic. Never has the life of a corrupt cop seemed more like fun. Watching Russell, we sense the exhilaration of being cut free from all laws and all morality, of being set loose on the street with a license to kill or abuse or satisfy any whim, generous or cruel. Eldon is a man unbound, or thinks he is, and Russell conveys that in a performance of physical freedom and emotional volatility. Most of Dark Blue involves two investigations. Eldon and his partner, Bobby (Scott Speedman), investigate a shooting in a small grocery store -- a crime, involving the death of several people, that the audience sees in the first minutes of the film and probably wishes it hadn't. Meanwhile, an honest deputy police chief (Ving Rhames) investigates Eldon and Bobby for a recent and highly questionable exercise of lethal force. In Ellroy's Los Angeles, corruption doesn't mean ignoring vice in exchange for an envelope filled with $100 bills. It means pinning crimes on innocent parties and even committing murder. In Dark Blue the phrase do what you do is what Eldon's superior -- the dean of L.A. corruption (Brendan Gleeson) -- says when he wants Eldon to go kill somebody who's become inconvenient. The line between the cops and crooks isn't blurry. It's the same team with different uniforms. While telling an intricate, ever-shifting story, Shelton and Ayer take time to show the psychological effects of a soul-dead, corrupt life. When Eldon comes home at night to his wife (Lolita Davidovich), it's as weird for him as returning to a quiet house after a rock concert. He can't turn it off. He can't speak softly. He can't stop cursing or laughing inappropriately at horrible things. He has become a creature of the street who belongs nowhere else. As the honest chief, Rhames is solid as always, and Speedman brings a nice quality of nascent virtue to his role as Eldon's young sidekick. But it's Russell whom audiences will come away talking about. This is an actor who has never been less than competent, but here he either leaps to a whole other level -- or maybe finally gets to show what his level truly is. His climactic monologue is the stuff of anthologies, inventive and flawless. The Los Angeles riot in Dark Blue, explicitly re-created, hovers over everything and finally explodes, in a way similar to the draft riots in Gangs of New York. But in Gangs of New York the riots function as a kind of deus ex machina, while in Dark Blue the riot is integrated into the action and themes of the story. It's interesting and unexpected. Shelton's new film is as blood-drenched but more skillful than Scorsese's. - This film contains strong language, sexual situations and brutal, graphic violence. ",1
"Dawn of the Dead: Horror. Starring Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber. Directed by Zack Snyder. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) But unlike the 1978 Dawn of the Dead, this remake of the George A. Romero film keeps that metaphor implicit and its social satire under wraps. You can make a social satire only if the audience is interested in society. Instead, the new Dawn of the Dead satirizes itself and satirizes its genre, and, on its own unambitious terms, the movie succeeds. It's silly, witty and good-natured, not scary so much as icky, and not horrifying or horrible but consistently amusing. Yet such is the skill at work here -- just imagine the challenge of making 105 minutes of zombie killing interesting -- that one can't help wish director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn had gone for something more evocative and unsettling. The undead, after all, are like mindless consumers run amok, always eating and never full, suffering from the spiritual disease of eternal famine. When the still-healthy humans flee to the shopping mall for safety, one might expect the mall to be presented with some irony. Instead it's presented, unambiguously, as a sanctuary. Fine. This is 2004, not 1978, and we have bigger things to worry about. Though it's wrong to read the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks into everything, the stylish pre-credits sequence, in which actress Sarah Polley frantically drives through destroyed neighborhoods, can't help but evoke our worst nightmares. In 2004, it's just impossible to do a long shot of a city in ruins without knowing that you're recalling images of lower Manhattan in the fall of 2001. If there's one fear that's real in Dawn of the Dead, one terror that's presented without smirking irony, it's the terror of civil chaos -- of waking up to the clock-radio one morning and finding out that it's all gone to hell. Polley plays Ana, a young nurse, who hooks up with Ving Rhames, a police sergeant with lots of guns. The two join a small group -- an even-tempered man named Michael (Jake Weber) and a married couple (Mekhi Phifer and Inna Korobkina) -- and off they go to the mall, for refuge. There they meet three really stupid security guards, among them CJ (Michael Kelly), the leader, who is more concerned about the possibility of the mall's getting looted than about the possible end of human life on this planet. That's the basic lineup, and the rest of the movie is all the stuff that happens: The random zombie. The gradual multiplication of zombies hovering around all sides of the mall. The bonding, the tension, the adjustment to life without hope. In one scene, as the characters look on all sides for ravenous maniacs, the mall's sound system plays a Muzak version of Don't Worry, Be Happy. In another high-tension, grotesque moment, the Muzak is playing You Light Up My Life. Dawn of the Dead goes a long way on such moments of macabre wit, and Gunn's screenplay, working within the limits of the workaday horror genre, finds ways to delineate character and provide colorful clashes between the various personalities. Polley, usually ethereal in a matter-of-fact way, gets the chance to become an action heroine, a thinking person's Linda Hamilton. She's fun -- they're all fun -- especially Rhames and Kelly. Special mention should also be made of Ty Burrell as Steve, a snotty rich guy who gets the film's best lines. Asked if the people in a certain section of town are all dead, he answers, Dead-ish. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, strong language and nonstop violence. ",1
"Debra Winger has a close-up early in “The Lovers,” and the sight of her smart, amused face — that surprisingly open smile she has — makes you realize: She didn’t used to be Debra Winger. She is Debra Winger, and what a good thing it is to see her in a lead role, her first on the big screen in 16 years.“The Lovers” stars Winger and Tracy Letts as two people in a seemingly dead marriage. They’re each seriously involved in another relationship, and both are thinking of initiating the conversation that will bring on the divorce. And then something weird happens — they start becoming attracted to each other.From the description, that might sound like the premise for a zany romantic comedy, but it isn’t. Or it might sound like the recipe for a searing emotional drama, a painful and serious dissection of a marriage, but “The Lovers” isn’t that, either. It’s a little of that, perhaps, just as it’s something of a comedy. But really, it’s very much its own thing, a movie with a singular vision and sensibility.The easiest way to describe that sensibility, because it’s worth describing, is to start with Mandy Hoffman’s score. It is a full-on classic Hollywood soundtrack, surging and commenting on the action, insisting on the importance of these lives, not in a naive way, but in a self-conscious and knowing way. At times, the romanticism of the music borders on a wise-guy response to the bizarre behavior of these characters, and yet it’s always emphatically sincere.The music is not quite saying, “Life has meaning,” but it is saying, “Let’s assume life has meaning,” and “This is real for the characters.” This music is combined with performances that are not inflected for laughs, but are serious, and with situations that would be comic in any other context. The result is this wonderful double thing of a movie that’s distancing and yet involving, absurd and yet heartfelt, extreme and yet small-scale and human.It’s the kind of achievement that probably could only come from a writer-director — that is, from one person doing both jobs — because the vision here could neither have been fully realized on paper, nor imposed from without. In someone else’s hands, Azazel Jacobs’ script could have easily made for a gimmicky movie. Instead he has directed it into a film that lingers in the mind in a weird state of suspension, making us wonder about things like time and chance and disappointment.In a sense, Jacobs has made a movie about sex that’s not about sex at all. We often hear about “sexual sublimation,” but “The Lovers” depicts the reverse, which is probably more common, in which sexual adventure becomes the most available substitute for cherished lost dreams. This is where Letts’ performance becomes important, because we can read the character’s history in Letts’ face before we know the details. He’s miserable, but it’s like he’s gotten used to misery. Misery is no big deal. In addition to Winger and Letts, Jacobs gets notable performances from Tyler Ross, who plays the couple’s son, teeming with an exaggerated sense of outrage; and Melora Walters, as Letts’ angry, erratic girlfriend. Between the lines, you get the feeling that he’s actually driven her crazy, that she is just reacting in a reasonable way to a lover who’s there but not really there, who hasn’t been really there even for himself in many years.

In “Alien: Covenant,” the latest from Ridley Scott, we get a glimmer of what that would really mean — the mass production of potentially dangerous sociopaths.In many ways, this new installment in the “Alien” series is a conventional horror movie, starting quietly and building in intensity, from the first hint of trouble to the thunderous life-and-death struggle at the finish. But its cinematic stylishness and its attention to modern-day anxiety raise it to something out of the ordinary.The opening pre-credits sequence is a tribute to Stanley Kubrick, taking place in a spare, white room. It’s a conversation about the source of creation between a human (Guy Pearce) and the very human-looking robot he has created (Michael Fassbender). The whole feeling is cold and somber, full of a sense of loss that’s punctuated by the robot’s innocent observation that he is eternal but that the human scientist will eventually die. This brings an uneasy feeling, an inkling that humanity has bitten off a little more than it can chew.Soon we’re in the midst of an outer-space emergency. The robot, Walter, is at the helm of a colony ship on the way to a distant planet. The human crew is in a state of suspended animation, but when a fire erupts, Walter wakes up the officers so they can pilot their way out of the crisis. Billy Crudup is the nervous, self-doubting captain, and Katherine Waterston plays his first officer. They lead an idiosyncratic and engaging crew consisting of Carmen Ejogo and Danny McBride, among others.Trailer for Ridley Scott's 2017 film, Alien: Covenant.The emergency and the deaths of some of their crew members leave the survivors in an unsettled state that makes them ripe for rash choices. Unwilling to get back into their hibernation pods — where 46 of their company have been burned to death — they become intrigued by a human-sounding transmission from a nearby planet. This presents them with a choice: Either continue for another seven years to their planned and fully vetted destination or improvise. The shaky captain chooses to improvise — to send a reconnaissance team to the nearby planet and find the source of the transmission.As anyone who has ever seen an “Alien” movie knows, winging it through outer space is never a good idea. But at first the alien planet looks perfectly nice. There’s water and sky and fertile-looking soil. Yet something is strange. “Hear that?” the first officer points out. “There’s no sound. No birds, no animals, nothing.”For the uninitiated, the alien of the “Alien” movies is a particularly grotesque creation, not a single monster, but a species, with a head shaped like a bus, no visible eyes, and rows of little teeth. But what’s especially horrifying is its gestation: As tiny buds, they float into a human orifice, making the host very, very sick. And then they come busting out through the torso, ready to jump on to anyone’s face and start eating it.It’s a testament not only to the movie’s aura of intelligence but also to its actual intelligence that the gruesomeness doesn’t overwhelm everything else. Though the scale is large and the action takes up a fair chunk of the screen time, “Alien: Covenant” remains grounded in its ideas and in the struggles of its individual characters. And the idea most present is that things are beginning to get out of hand, that the mechanistic future promised by science is one in which human life will become cheap and embattled.Fassbender is at the center of the film, playing not one but two robots, Walter and his older and more emotional predecessor, David. Waterston takes on the traditional horror-movie heroine role — the good woman who must face down the monster — with a probity that transcends the cliche. But the best thing about “Alien: Covenant” is the feeling that comes through the frames.Yes, the movie may be fantastic and outlandish, but the aura surrounding it is unsettling in its familiarity. It is one of unspoken, undefined dread, a dread that isn’t sci-fi and isn’t even fiction, but that is already inside the audience. ",1
"Director Roger Michell finds a particular register for “My Cousin Rachel,” something different from his previous work (“Notting Hill,” “Changing Lanes”). He embraces the gothic aspect of this Daphne du Maurier tale, giving us slow-motion shots of things like pearls tumbling down a staircase, while basking in the glorious excesses of Rael Jones’ soundtrack — with its abrupt swells and sudden silences.Michell pumps the atmosphere surrounding this story with as much life and energy as he can, without ever crossing the line into self-consciousness or parody. In doing so, he gives this film the bigness of emotion that it deserves, so that this can never be mistaken for some dry, starched British import, something that might show on Masterpiece Theater.The opening minutes keep us guessing. At first it seems as it might indeed be one of those restrained stories of English manners, of interest only to the most ardent Anglophiles. Moments later, it seems to open up as a tale of intrigue, involving two people with a conflicting claim to a vast estate. But soon it settles into something different and far more fascinating, a movie that eludes easy classification.Sam Claflin is Philip, a young man who thinks he has good reason to hate his cousin Rachel (Rachel Weisz), the widow of his late guardian. When he was alive, the guardian had written Philip some desperate and paranoid letters from Italy, saying that his British-Italian wife was holding him captive and slowly poisoning him. Philip can’t be sure if the guardian was deluded, the victim of a severe illness, or if he was indeed describing a genuine, concerted effort to put him 6 feet under. In any case, Philip is willing to believe the worst — he wants to believe it, hating Rachel with a young man’s gusto. And then he meets her, when she finally comes to see him and the estate that she’s heard so much about. That’s when things become complicated for the young fellow. The movie could have been called “My Cousin Rachel Weisz.” Hating her is an unsustainable position.Much of “My Cousin Rachel” deals with the nature of Rachel and Philip’s contact, with the film’s mystery located within the soul of the title character. What is she thinking? Who is she? The movie stays within Philip’s perspective. We see her when he sees her, and we draw our own conclusions, but we can’t ever be 100 percent sure that our perceptions are correct or if Philip’s are closer to the truth. By forcing us to stay within Philip’s vantage point, the movie makes a subtle but clear point. Sam is 24, about to turn 25. He has no conception of what is going on inside the head of a beautiful woman in her early 40s. The moral polarities that he imagines and tries to decide between don’t even apply. This woman is so complex, and so much the product of a variety of experiences and influences, that if he were to know even half of what’s inside her, his head would explode. This dynamic between youth and young middle age is at the heart of “My Cousin Rachel” and the source of its mystery. If we watch the movie only wondering whether Rachel is good or evil, we are getting stuck inside Philip’s perspective. What’s actually going on, there for anyone to see, is bigger. The magnificence of Weisz’s performance — yes, it’s another magnificent performance from Rachel Weisz — is that she is never hiding anything, beyond what a 19th century woman might conceal out of polite reserve. In her every moment on screen, she is an open book. We’re just not seeing all her pages. Rachel remains fixed, while Claflin’s Philip ricochets all around her, exhausting his spirit and stretching his brain to wrap around a universe beyond his comprehension. It’s a smart portrait of male desperation that manages to hit all the stages from smug confidence to panic, in a film that’s not really about vice or virtue, after all. To appreciate fully “My Cousin Rachel,” that much must be understood going in: This is not a morality tale but an illustration of the consequences of incomprehension. ",1
"Director and co-producer David L. Brown of Brisbane, known for his documentaries on nuclear issues, looks at the lives of 10 older surfers as examples of exceptional health. One, Northern California resident John Doc Ball, is 93 and still rides chilly North Coast waves without a wetsuit. Through interviews and film footage, Brown creates portraits of surfers with a youthful outlook on life because their sport keeps them fit and adds counterculture savoir faire to their sun-bleached days. Surfers profiled include big-wave legends -- among them Woody Brown, 88, the famed catamaran innovator; Rabbit Kekai, 79; John Kelly, 81; Eve Fletcher, 73; Anona Napoleon, 60; Fred Van Dyke, 70 -- from various walks of life. Each surfs regularly and is supremely healthy. The film, though, is more than a cheer for surfing geezers. It also provides a rare glimpse at the history of surfing, showing its old adherents in action, recording the surf and beach scene as it developed, especially in California in the early days. Crank up the Surfaris and catch that south break! -- Peter Stack There are flat zones in this year's outing -- the compilation of 14 films could have lost Village of Idiots, a wonderfully drawn but repetitious 13-minute reworking of an old Jewish folktale. But even with its slow spots, the festival is loaded with entertainment firepower. It's a true alternative to mainstream movie fare. Outstanding pieces include a trio of Oscar nominees -- Three Misses by Dutch animator Paul Driessen, examining notions of heroism; the delightful Hum Drum by Aardman Animation's Peter Peake, about two bored shadow puppets; and the funny but touching When the Day Breaks, by Canadians Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis, about an urban neighborhood peopled by domestic animals. Aardman (the Wallace and Gromit studio) and animator Darren Walsh provide Angry Kid, a funny series about a teenager spewing venom at his parent. Kirby Atkin's Mutt is a riotous study of a stand-up-comedian dog trying to entertain fellow mutts in the pound. Visual stunners are Fishing by David Gainey and PDI, the Peninsula imaging company famed for Antz';' and Panther, by Germany's Vuk Jevremovic. It's a gorgeous study of ideas about freedom based on a Rilke poem. -- Peter Stack It is a story of acknowledgment and loyalty. As a traveller living in rootless caravans -- a rough approximation of trailer trash in the United States -- the light-welterweight Barrett fought for recognition of his outcast clan as much as anything. Two engaging, and profoundly decent, personalities emerge -- the sunny but calm and centered 19- year-old boxer and Chick Gillen, his mentor Chick the Barber, who trained Barrett in a makeshift gym set up in a 30-foot discarded cargo container and saw him go on to carry the flag for Ireland at the Olympics. Barrett's piston-driven jabs are so quick the camera almost can't catch them. A turning point comes when Barrett must decide whether to shoot for the next Olympics, in Sydney, or turn pro -- and is urged to take his training up to another level and leave Gillen behind. The Irish dialects heard here are a challenge at first, but careful listeners will find them easier to grasp as Liam McGrath's totally involving film progresses. --Bob Graham When the boys aren't worshiping a washed-up wrestling star called Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), they're vacuuming sewage from portable toilets and driving around in a truck full of waste. Their jobs are supposed to indicate what losers they are, but they're also the setup for a series of excrement jokes. Flatulent-nun jokes are also provided by screenwriter Steven Brill -- he wrote the Mighty Ducks movies -- along with body slams, bitch slaps, curvy babes in skimpy outfits and finger-down-the-back-of-the- pants jokes. Platt has his moments as Jimmy, a bogus hick who wears a crown and cape and carries a scepter. Like the Wizard of Oz, Jimmy's a faker beneath the bluster, a no-talent who sees pro wrestling as a circus show with dancing clowns. After promoter Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano) cans Jimmy, Gordie and Sean find him passed out in his trailer, boost his ego and orchestrate his comeback. The message: Common people need heroes too, and in a bogus world may be forced to invent them. Arquette is about 10 years too old to play a part like this, and his charming-dweeb shtick is wearing thin. The chance to see superstar Goldberg in a two-scene cameo isn't worth the price of admission, even for wrestling fans. -- Advisory: Raunchy jokes, foul language, sexual innuendos. -- Edward Guthman Kevin Pollak plays a U.S. president who is faced with a global crisis while snowed in at a campaign stop in Colorado. Iraq has invaded Kuwait, heading for Saudi Arabia. The president responds by going on television and announcing that, unless Iraq withdraws, he will drop a nuclear bomb on Baghdad, a city of 12 million people. Is this president a decisive leader? Or is he a monster? My opinion is that he is an evil megalomaniac, but not everyone will share that view. Rod Lurie, a former Los Angeles film critic turned writer-director, keeps his cards close to his vest. Pollak is a casting surprise. He is too young and too short ever to get elected, but that's part of the movie's point. Turns out this president wasn't elected but, like Gerald Ford, came to power by happenstance. Pollak does not have an inherent presidential presence, but he takes on an imposing aura as the picture progresses. Still, though the president's bearing may be admirable, it doesn't mean he's right. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language. --Mick LaSalle  Documentary. Directed by Monika Treut. (Not rated. 86 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Stryker, a male-to-female transsexual, is one of the subjects of Gendernauts, an upbeat documentary that opens today. So is Max Valerio, a female-to-male transsexual who describes the rush he gets from testosterone, and Texas Tomboy, a transgender cyborg who won't be defined as male or female. Made in San Francisco by German filmmaker Monika Treut, Gendernauts explores the transgender and intersex communities of San Francisco and argues that male and female are arbitrary labels that deny the full spectrum of gender identity. Gender isn't fixed, Treut suggests, but an endlessly fluid continuum. She also spotlights sex artist Annie Sprinkle, who calls San Francisco the sex capital of the entire planet; Oakland photographer Stafford, who says that gender confusion is a small price to pay for social progress; and a lively drag king competition where trannies and butch women wear crotch socks and fake beards. Treut has a knack for drawing intimate, relaxed portraits. She succeeds at destigmatizing her subjects -- presenting them as individuals with jobs, romances and mundane concerns -- but her film doesn't run awfully deep. By taking a noncritical gaze, Treut skims the risks of gender experimentation: the connection between testosterone therapy and breast cancer and the possible complications of phalloplasties. -- Advisory: Frank language, mature subject matter, nudity. -- Edward Guthman ..

"Documentaries have a wonderful way of making us care about people and things way outside our own experience, and Buck is a prime example. My entire contact with horses has consisted of watching my father lose money at the track and of looking into the eyes of those forlorn carriage horses outside New York's Central Park. Yet I was completely gripped by Buck, a documentary about a Montana horseman and teacher who brings a beautiful humanity to his work with these magnificent animals.In Buck, director Cindy Meehl has two overriding points she wants to make, and she makes them: The first is that Buck Brannaman is a hell of a man - decent, honest and sensitive in the best way. The second is that there is no need ever to break a horse, a term Buck refuses to use. Horses should be taught and led, through a training system that takes time to understand their fears and mental processes.As the movie shows, Buck came by his empathy the hard way, by having a cruel alcoholic father who terrorized and beat him. Instead of ending up destroyed, Buck overcame his past and became especially alert to the frailties and terrors of defenseless animals. Just the sight of this guy on horseback is moving, a clear and respectful communion between man and horse, in which both transcend their limitations.The documentary shows Buck over the course of a year, as he travels and teaches. Along the way, Robert Redford is interviewed about Buck's contribution to The Horse Whisperer (1998). Redford likes him, so he can't be a phony.Buck insists throughout that whoever you are, it will be reflected in your relationship with your horse. What he means by this is demonstrated in a long section, late in the film, in which he tries to get through to a horse that has been mishandled and misunderstood since birth. Buck can barely contain his anger at the owner, and of course this is personal for him: He knows how awful it is to have a bad parent.In this way, Buck becomes about something bigger than one person's story or than animal training. It's about the pitfalls of neurosis and about the responsibilities of parenthood. It's about looking out for weaker creatures and doing the right thing when the right thing is required - not years later, when it's too late. Documentary. Starring Buck Brannaman and Robert Redford. Directed by Cindy Meehl. (Rated PG. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)﻿",1
"Documentary about Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge. Directed by Pierre Thoretton. (Not rated. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) L'amour Fou engages and moves viewers in two distinct ways. It engages us by showing us something we don't know about that's interesting. Specifically, it shows what it was like to be Yves Saint Laurent, the world's leading fashion designer, what his world was like, what his pressures were and how it all looked from the inside.  It moves us by showing us something we immediately understand, that has nothing to do with being a big shot and everything to do with being just another person at the mercy of time: After Saint Laurent died, his longtime lover and business manager sold all their stuff - the accumulation of their lives together, artworks and curiosities - at auction.  Now, some people who see L'amour Fou will be interested in the $480 million worth of art being auctioned, the Warhols and other items that capture, in their way, the era of Saint Laurent's heyday in the '60s and '70s. For those people, L'amour Fou will have an extra element of interest. But most others, I suspect, will be moved simply by the human spectacle of the surviving member in a relationship divesting himself of objects that once shared meaning and now connote loss. He could be selling them at Christie's or at some forlorn yard sale. It's the same emotion. Those of us who are young or middle-aged spend so much time dreading or fearing the unexpected calamity - the horrible accident, the premature illness - that the sadness associated with the typical order of things doesn't always grip the imagination with appropriate force. The idea of someone simply getting old enough for the sand to run out in the usual way - well, Why get maudlin about that? we think. That's just life. Then you see something like L'amour Fou and realize, oh, yeah. Even being lucky and having 50 years together has its sadness. Nothing, nothing is easy. These feelings will touch anybody, but will, I suspect, especially reach people who are in long-term relationships, and most especially gay couples and also straight couples without children. Where does all the stuff go? After all those years of acquisition, the day comes when everything just flies off in different directions. Saint Laurent, in archival footage, comes across as an engaging fellow, deeply shy and sensitive, often smiling but without much of a gift for happiness - someone who started out beautiful but whose pain eventually showed up on his face. Berge, by contrast, seems as normal as Saint Laurent was extraordinary, but also devoted and much more capable of functioning in the world. They were probably a great couple.",1
"Documentary about prostitution. Directed by Michael Glawogger. (Not rated. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Austrian filmmaker Michael Glawogger's documentary about prostitutes around the world, Whores' Glory, is as sad a film as you can possibly see. To experience it is to be haunted by the bleakness and ugliness of prostitution, the hopeless trap of it, and the defeat of love that it represents. It's to hear the voice of a teenage girl in Bangladesh, who looks into the camera with a 1,000-year-old sadness and asks why it is that women's lives should be so difficult.  The film contains nudity, naked dancers and several graphic sex acts, and it's all about as erotic as a plate of rotten food. This is as it should be. Methodically and without judgment, Glawogger is presenting us with a human tragedy of enormous scale and complexity, a life-destroying catastrophe for the women, and a soul-destroying one for the men. Poverty and loneliness meet, and then walk away just as poor and lonely, but distorted and with less hope. The movie starts off grim and gets grimmer, beginning in Bangkok, where the girls all sit behind glass and the men stumble in and ask the floor manager's advice: How is Girl 210? Would 243 be better? They place an order, and the girl emerges in her skirt and high heels. The club offers the illusion of gentility, of conviviality. An American in a cowboy hat talks to a Thai prostitute, who speaks no English. But you can smile, can't you? the man says, trapped in his own fantasy, from across gulfs of language and privilege. To see Whores' Glory is to feel sorry for almost everybody, with the exception of the very young men, and you can feel sorry for them, too, for their being so young and ridiculous. The movie shifts to the brothel district in Bangladesh, and that makes the Bangkok club look like a sorority house. It's all so ghastly, degraded and impoverished that it's difficult to imagine anyone in this environment thinking of this place in erotic terms. Yet the next stop on Glawogger's journey - La Zona, a prostitution zone in Reynosa, Mexico - is if anything even more disheartening, in that the girls are middle-aged and on crack.  Glawogger gets remarkable access here. That prostitutes should be willing to be filmed is perhaps not so mysterious, so long as their time is paid for. But who are these men, appearing on camera talking about their wives? I can only guess that there are guys right now in Reynosa, Bangladesh and Bangkok going around with some vague drunken recollection of movie cameras and a profound terror that Whores' Glory will be coming to a theater near them.",1
"Documentary about the Merry Pranksters. Directed by Alison Ellwood and Alex Gibney. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The cross-country trip of the Merry Pranksters is the subject of this often fascinating documentary, culled largely from the many hours of footage shot by the Pranksters themselves on their long, LSD-laced journey across the United States and back in 1964. Directed by Alison Ellwood and Alex Gibney, the film matches this footage with contemporary and vintage interviews to give the flavor of this signature event in the national consciousness. The first striking thing about the documentary is that nothing about it reads 1964. The footage was shot at the same time as the Johnson-Goldwater presidential race, at a time when even the Beatles were in black and white, and yet the pictures here are in rich color. The bus looks like something out of the Magical Mystery Tour three years before the event, and the vibe and attitude of the participants also look like 1967. If you knew nothing else but the images and the chronology, you would know for certain that you were seeing the advance guard.  On the less exalted end of the equation, it does seem that everyone who encountered these folks in 1964 discovered something that most people would not know for years: There is nothing more tiresome - more goofy, more boring, more certain of their own profundity - than people on acid. And that's when things go well. When they go bad, they end up like the woman known here as Stark Naked, a stunningly beautiful young woman who, according to the film, took LSD and never quite came back. The period footage shows all the principals, including Neal Cassady, who was only 38 but looked 52. Ken Kesey emerges as the film's hero - he is presented as a great American adventurer, the psychological equivalent of Lewis and Clark. Maybe that's not as ridiculous as it sounds.",1
"Documentary. Directed by Jacques Perrin. (G. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's a privileged view. We get to see close-up what it's like to fly over long distances, across oceans and into rain and snow. Sometimes the birds just hold out their wings and glide, but for the most part flying is revealed to be a physically exhausting activity, a kind of light aerobics done for hours on end, even days. To see this film is to forever look at geese with respect. They know things we don't know. Director Jacques Perrin is best known as an actor. (He played the middle- aged Salvatore, the world-famous director who comes home to Sicily in the last segment of Cinema Paradiso.) But in recent years he has been making amazing nature films, including Microcosmos, a documentary about insects, and Himalaya, a dramatic feature about the salt men of Tibet, starring real- life Tibetan salt men. Like Perrin's other films, Winged Migration is, in the watching of it, alternately stunning and dull -- there's a whole lot of flapping going on for 85 minutes. Yet days later, the movie crystallizes in the mind and becomes truly splendid. In a way, it's an experience akin to travel, something that's fine in the moment, but only afterward reveals itself as a jewel -- a consciousness-broadening experience that thereafter feels indispensable. It took five crews three years (July 1998 to June 2001) to gather the footage, which spans 40 countries and seven continents. Some of it is amazing. In one scene, geese are flying in the middle of the ocean and see a battleship. As Perrin explains in voice-over, anything resembling land is a chance for birds to catch a rest, and so the geese swoop down on the deck of the ship and take a nap. There are poignant moments, as when a group of penned-up farm birds look up with consternation at the sight of a migrating flock overhead. The movie doesn't shy away from the harsh side of nature, although the most dispiriting moment in the film is a human one: Just when it seems safe, a pack of North American geese is shot up by morons in hunting hats, who blast at them with high-powered rifles. To the birds, there's no appreciable difference between a (pre-Sept. 11) New York harbor and the Seine. They're both just stops along the way. That doesn't make these real differences any less significant. On the contrary, it reminds us of how little humans and birds know of each other's worlds. Winged Migration is just a peek into the birds' view of things, and it's a precious one. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Minnie Driver and John Hurt. Directed by Richard Kwietniowski. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Owning Mahowny is a fascinating fact-based portrait of gambling addict Dan Mahowny, a Canadian bank manager who financed his addiction in the early 1980s through embezzlement. He created phantom loan accounts and juggled figures, keeping his scam alive for two years -- and to the tune of $10 million. As played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Mahowny is the picture of blandness. He dresses in cheap suits, drives a beat-up old car and lives in a nondescript apartment with lousy furniture. Money is not for buying things. It's for gambling. Hoffman portrays Mahowny as emotionally sealed off, a man with no interests and no pleasures, a kind of dead soul who needs the stimulus of the gambling table to feel alive. Playing bland can often be the same thing as being bland, but there are subtleties in Hoffman's performance that will reward attentive viewers. Note the way he holds the dice when he's throwing sevens. Then note the way he holds them throwing craps. It's different. Though always impassive, Mahowny is perceptibly different in his winning and losing modes. He's not a systematic gambler, but a reckless, self-destructive one. Give me all the home teams in the National League, and all the away teams in the American, he mumbles to his bookie (Maury Chaykin). He plays tens of thousand of dollars a hand at blackjack. His high-stakes playing makes him a popular man with an Atlantic City casino manager (John Hurt), who doesn't suspect that Mahowny is throwing away stolen money. The story has its tense moments, but it's the character study that keeps the eyes glued. We know, watching Hoffman, that something is welling up inside this bottled-up man and that it's coming out in the act of gambling. Not in his demeanor while gambling -- that remains unchanged -- but in the act of gambling itself. It's the scream of a man who's never learned to raise his voice. The stakes, yes, but not his voice. . This film contains sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle The last Pokemon movie -- the fourth in the series -- taught the adorable characters a brand-new trick. They laid an egg. The 1999 original, based on the wildly popular Game Boy games, pulled in a cool $85 million and a franchise was born. But the last one, Pokemon 4Ever, was a dreadful, dull story that featured the equivalent of kids ordering their pets to attack each other. That snoozer barely dented the box office window, earning less than $2 million. This one is likely to do better for several reasons. First, they've jazzed up the animation. The backgrounds appear to be digital, and they are striking. The story is also less violent and combative, concentrating on how Ash Ketchem and his shower toy pet, Pikachu, solve a mystery in a city that resembles Venice. The improved animation works best with the new characters, Latios and Latias, who take the kids on an underwater trip through the canals. However, the best addition may be two new villains, Annie and Oakley. Even the pre- kindergarten Pokemon audience will recognize them as the snotty kids who think they are cuter and cooler than anyone else. When those two get their comeuppance, it is a satisfying moment for all ages. But the real advantage this movie has is that Pokemon Heroes comes out -- in a stunning coincidence -- just as two new Game Boy games hit the shelves: Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire. No wonder it is called it Pokemon USA Inc. Oh and by the way, even if this one tanks, don't worry that little Pikachu will have to start hitting the casting calls. Pokemon six has already been released in Japan. . Mild violence and characters captured by villains. -- C.W. Nevius In experimental film circles, Maya Deren is considered the high priestess nonpareil. Her films, including the masterpiece Meshes in the Afternoon, introduced a kind of moving visual poetry to the screen -- and opened the door for mavericks such as Kenneth Anger, James Broughton and Stan Brakhage. In the Mirror of Maya Deren, a documentary by Austrian filmmaker Martina Kudlacek, not only celebrates Deren's cinematic legacy but also reveals a gifted talent whose explosive temperament was at odds with the lyrical, dreamlike imagery she put on screen. She was born Eleanora Derenkovskaya in Kiev, Ukraine, in 1917, and emigrated to the United States at age 5 with her psychiatrist father and musician mother. She abbreviated her last name and adopted the first name Maya, the name of the Buddha's mother and the word for veil of illusion in Hindu mythology. She married three times: first to a Russian socialist, next to fellow filmmaker Alexander Hammid, and last to a Japanese musician who was 18 years her junior. Short, wide-hipped, with a full head of bushy hair, Deren was the kind of unbridled personality who would dance wildly at parties, challenging the other guests to join her in pursuit of some purifying transcendence. Maya was always on fire, the late actress Judith Malina says. She had some intensity that never stopped sizzling. Once, when she was asked to perform a Haitian wedding ceremony at a friend's nuptials, and then thwarted at the last minute, Deren flew into a rage. Nobody believes me, but I saw it, Brakhage says. She hurled a refrigerator from one corner of the kitchen to another. In 1961, after years of being unable to finish a film, Deren died of a brain hemorrhage at 44. Some blamed it on the amphetamine-spiked, Doctor Feelgood injections that she self-administered, others on the Haitian practice of vodun that she studied and wrote about in the book The Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti. When an artist has powers like (hers), Brakhage says, if those get outside of the work process, it can kill you. I fervently believed that's what killed Maya. The material here is fascinating, and Kudlacek serves it best when she gets out of the way and lets the story tell itself, through Deren's film images and the testimony of friends and colleagues. But Kudlacek makes a huge mistake in overlaying clips from Deren's work with audio recordings of her lectures, in which she lays out her aesthetic intentions in dense, academic terms. It seems like a major violation -- not because the language misrepresents the films but because the films were meant to be experienced purely, like music, without filters or outside noise. -- Edward Guthmann Pop singer Bryan Adams has taken on his most curious project since that duet with Barbra Streisand. Adams appears in fantasy sequences as the dream date of a Chechen mental patient in House of Fools, an ill-conceived comedy that gets hokier from that point. Accomplished Russian filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky (Runaway Train) misfires remarkably with House of Fools, which is ruined from the start by its insulting depiction of mental illness. Set in a psychiatric hospital on the Chechen border in 1996, the movie is based on a true story, which hardly seems possible, given its outsize shenanigans. The inmates are oblivious to war around them, mostly because they're busy being eccentric. The idea of hilarious in House of Fools is a dwarf laughing maniacally as he runs down the hall or patients doing awkward calisthenics to accordion music. The actors chew the scenery, and drool while they do it. Aren't mentally ill people just so wacky? Julia Vysotsky plays the besotted Adams fan, who believes the pop star is going to marry her. The lovely, vivacious Vysotsky adopts a lisp and knocks her knees, but her character doesn't seem disturbed as much as young and starry-eyed. If falling for Adams' gravelly tones constitutes psychosis, then half the girls who grew up in the 1980s could have been committed. Things get a bit more tolerable once the Chechen soldiers take over the hospital, and the movie captures some casual ironies of war, like the Russian and Chechen captains discovering they fought side by side in Afghanistan, or the Chechen soldiers bartering arms for marijuana with their Russian counterparts. Konchalovsky dives into pathos midway through, when Vysotsky's character takes to heart a Chechen soldier's facetious offer of marriage, and her ward mates dress her for a wedding. It's hard to tell who's being more patronizing here, the soldier or the director. . This film contains nudity, graphic images of war. -- Carla Meyer ",1
"Documentary. Directed by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon. (Not rated. 119 minutes.)Near the end of the documentary The Central Park Five, a historian sums up the lesson of the story. He says, We're not very good people. The summation lands with authority, because it brutally encapsulates everything that has gone before. Yes, we have laws to protect us from the darker sides of human nature, but what happens when selfishness, laziness, ambition, mercilessness, racism, heedlessness and stupidity corrupt the legal process itself?  First, some history, then a question. In 1989, a female jogger in New York's Central Park was raped and almost beaten to death. Five black and Latino teenagers were arrested in what soon became known as a wilding incident, of kids going wild in the park and destroying everything and everyone in sight. This was the biggest crime story in the country. If you're over 35, you almost certainly remember this, and you might also remember that those teenagers were convicted and put away the following year. Now, here's the question: Did you know that 13 years later, these boys were found not guilty and their convictions overturned - that these boys didn't rape or beat anybody? That the crime was nothing like the one depicted in the media and presented by the prosecution? And that anyone in law enforcement or the media who cared to know the truth could have discovered it years before? If you're like me, you didn't know these things. The false story led newscasts and created headlines for weeks. The true story became a footnote. Directed by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and David McMahon, The Central Park Five uses interviews and archival footage to tell how it all happened. It was a time straight out of a Spike Lee movie, a time when New York was still a crime mecca. The rape and beating of this woman made the public angry and put pressure on the police and politicians to act. The cops rounded up a score of teenagers who were in the park that night and subjected them to harsh, relentless and repetitive questioning. According to the recollection of the teenagers, now men approaching 40, the police told them that if they were to confess to a certain prepackaged set of facts, they could go home that night. Five of them agreed to this. These were kids ranging in age from 14 to 17. They were scared. They thought the cops were being helpful. So they made false confessions on videotape, and the next morning New York City had five new faces to hate. No matter that the DNA evidence implicated none of them, that the crime scene indicated a single rapist and that their confessions conflicted with each other. The investment in their guilt became emotional, and citywide. If these were middle- or upper-middle-class kids, any one of them might have stepped up to the microphones and said, OK, we didn't do this, and I'll tell you why. But these were poor kids, tongue-tied, sullen and persecuted, and so they walked past reporters in stone silence, looking like the guiltiest people in America. They look so guilty that for half the movie you might think, well, maybe they did do it. But no, the evidence in the other direction is conclusive, complete and incontrovertible. The real question is how such a miscarriage of justice could have happened. Surely, if the prosecution didn't know they were innocent, it could have easily found out. But so much professional ambition rode on the guilt of these boys that the lawyers either didn't care or didn't want to know. The Central Park Five is worth seeing, both for the ways it's timeless and for the ways it encapsulates an era. The small emotions and behaviors are timeless, of course, but the crime and the class and racial polarization seem like something from the New York of Do the Right Thing, also from 1989. It doesn't seem like the America of today. Or perhaps that's too optimistic. See The Central Park Five and decide for yourself. ",1
"Documentary. Directed by Lev Anderson and Chris Meltzer. (Not rated. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Unless you're a fan of Fishbone, Everyday Sunshine is probably just a documentary about a band you've never heard of, whose music you probably will not like. But there's a bigger and more interesting subject at work in this film. It's a movie about what it's like to almost make it in the music business, but not really, not quite. It's about coming close and watching it slip away.  Fishbone began life in the early 1980s, formed by a group of friends who met in high school. These were mostly inner-city black kids in Los Angeles who were being bused to a white school in the valley, and their music took on every possible influence. They sounded like a combination of funk, new wave, jazz, ska and hardcore punk. Like Frank Zappa meets Black Flag. Or to put it another way, they sounded like tightly orchestrated madness. In their live shows, captured on archival film, so much is coming at you simultaneously that it first sounds like a wash of noise. But pay attention, and you will be impressed by the sophistication of what these guys were doing. Within a couple of years of graduating high school, Fishbone was making records for Columbia and appearing on Saturday Night Live. But they never clicked with the public, and eventually Columbia dropped them. Over the course of the movie, the band members (who are still performing), as well as their friends and colleagues, entertain theories as to why. George Clinton, for example, suggests that they sounded too black for a white audience and too white for a black audience.  But the reason for their lack of success is no mystery. It's apparent in their music and in their stage shows: This was a band for highly specialized tastes. This was not music with mainstream appeal, and the band members never compromised their vision to accommodate a popular audience. As the movie shows, this had consequences: The life of an artist sometimes means being a highly talented person and living in your mother's house when you're in your 40s.  The story of these men over the years, coping with that disappointment and continuing to make music, has its own fascination. They're musicians, but Everyday Sunshine could be the story of any artists, still pursuing an elusive dream, year in and year out. ",1
"Documentary. Directed by Robert H. Lieberman. (Not rated. 75 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) They Call It Myanmar, but most of us know it as Burma, except we don't know Burma, hardly at all, because it has existed under a military dictatorship for the last 50 years. The regime has deliberately kept it isolated from outside influences, and thus this documentary by Robert H. Lieberman, accurately subtitled Lifting the Curtain. The film provides one of the ultimate functions of a documentary, taking us into the life and culture of a people most of us would never know. For the first 10 minutes, Burma looks like an ideal travel destination - gorgeous and exotic, full of pristine Buddhist temples and friendly people. But then you notice the military presence, and the fact that Lieberman isn't allowed to videotape anything or anybody. (He does anyway.) Few Burmese will make even the most innocuous criticism of the government, at least not on camera, out of fear of being carried off in the night. One man becomes positively giddy when asked his opinion of things - it's the first time anyone has ever asked his opinion. Child labor is rampant, and kids get about a year or two of schooling at best. The health care is deplorable, even heartbreaking and enraging. Great wealth exists side by side - literally, on the same street - as horrific poverty, and dissenters, including Buddhist monks, are killed in the street. Everything indicates a society, not in free fall, but already fallen. Yet there is one bright light, besides the humor and radiance of the people and Burmese youth's embrace of Western culture: Aung San Suu Kyi. The film includes talking-head interviews with this symbol of Burmese democracy, who was under house arrest at the time (for 15 of the previous 20 years). A Nobel laureate, Suu Kyi was released just recently, and April 1, it was announced that she won a seat in the Burmese parliament. Thus, this documentary is not just interesting, but timely.",1
"Drama-comedy. Starring Yvan Attal, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Terence Stamp. Directed and written by Attal. (R. 93 minutes. In French and English with English subtitles. At the Clay and Rafael). That's until you consider the insecurity of living in their shadows, a concept French actor Yvan Attal addresses provocatively in My Wife Is an Actress, his writing and directing debut. Attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage. He stars opposite real-life wife Charlotte Gainsbourg, who plays a French movie star named Charlotte. Attal obviously has drawn on his life, veiling himself partially by playing a sportswriter -- movie shorthand for regular guy. His character's outlook on fame, therefore, is from the outside, like the audience's. He views the perks of his new wife's status with ambivalence: great tables at restaurants are no big deal, but he likes that women find him hot because he's married to a sex symbol. He'll even stomach a traffic cop slobbering over Charlotte if it means he can get out of a ticket. It all turns sour, however, when his wife's steamy love scene makes him wonder whether she's really playacting. Attal plants a cloud of suspicion on his face, one that darkens when Charlotte goes on location with a sexy leading man, played with a scampish wink by Terence Stamp. In a funny but unsettling scene, Attal's character struggles to be civil to the actor but can't resist mocking his French pronunciation, alienating his wife in the process. Gainsbourg's character seems too sweet to be true until she tangles with her onscreen director over nudity. The fire Gainsbourg brings to the scene suggests she's had similar battles. That Attal is really an actor, and less famous than his wife, brings up some fascinating questions. Had he played an actor, the picture could have touched on professional jealousy, along with the simpatico of being in the same game as his wife. It's a moot point, however, because Attal establishes a new career as a filmmaker with My Wife Is an Actress. . This film contains nudity, sexual scenes. -- Carla Meyer 'BARAN'Drama. Starring Hossein Abedini, Mohammad Reza Naji and Zahra Bahrami. Directed by Majid Majidi. (PG. 98 minutes. In Farsi with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) . An enormous strain of compassion runs through the films of Majid Majidi. His work has a depth of feeling that can't be faked and that makes exploring his artistic personality an enriching experience. That was the case with the Iranian director's earlier works, The Color of Heaven and Children of Heaven, and it's true with his latest, Baran. Unlike the earlier films, however, the new movie requires the viewer to adjust to Majidi's rhythms, which are slow and meditative. Baran is not a movie to see after a big lunch -- it induces a hypnotic state that could, at the wrong time, easily develop into flat-out slumber. But at the right time of day, in the right frame of mind, Baran can and should be appreciated as a work of delicate and unmistakable beauty. Made with a cast of amateurs, the picture deals with life in an Iranian city near the Afghanistan border, where Afghan refugees -- who have lived in poverty since the Soviet invasion of 1979 -- eke out an existence as laborers. Hossein Abedini plays Latif, a mean-spirited Iranian teenager who works in construction and develops an instant dislike for Rahmat (Zahra Bahrami), an Afghan refugee hired to work on the same crew. When something happens to alter the young man's perception of Rahmat, it sets in motion a chain of events that transforms Latif from a callow hothead into a tactful, spiritually conscious young man, one capable of empathy and sacrifice. In the process of showing us this transformation, Majidi takes us into a world that most of us will never see except on film -- an Iranian industrial city, its white skyscrapers dwarfed by mountains in the background. Everyone knows the Afghanis have not had it easy for the past 20 years, but there's a difference between knowing it and seeing it. Majidi shows us teenage girls doing heavy labor. He shows us men in their 40s who look 65, and men in their 50s who look 100. The images of Baran are stark and not easily forgotten. -- Mick LaSalle 'NEVER AGAIN'Romantic comedy. Starring Jill Clayburgh and Jeffrey Tambor. Directed by Eric Schaeffer. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Jill Clayburgh is a fine screen actress with important movies on her resume, so it's especially dispiriting to see her strapping on sex toys and making a fool of herself in Never Again, a wretched comedy about middle-aged romance from writer-director Eric Schaeffer. Supposedly an anti-ageist film, the movie is in fact creepily ageist and depressing, suggesting that there's no better way to be in one's 50s than to go around like some decrepit, sex-crazed teenager. The picture shows off Clayburgh and her co-star, Jeffrey Tambor, in ways that are unbecoming, to say the least. And it's all for nothing: The characters they play are ill-defined and absurd, and their interaction is bogus. Clayburgh's presence keeps Never Again from being completely worthless, but it also makes it more painful. She has a restaurant crackup scene that's particularly fine -- she explodes with rage when she realizes that a boyfriend is about to break up with her. Here is an actress who still has the fire but just needs the right script. Yet for every scene like that crackup, there are 10 that are idiotic or demeaning. Like the one in which she embarrasses her friends by talking out loud and in detail about her sexual escapades. Or the other one, the notorious one, the nadir of Clayburgh's career, in which she straps on a dildo and just can't seem to get it off, not even with a butcher knife. Tambor plays an exterminator who moonlights as a jazz musician, a man who we're told regularly has affairs with 25-year-old women. After all, nothing drives the young ladies wild like the prospect of a carnal romp with a heavyset, balding 54-year-old exterminator. It's amazing he can keep the women off him. Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and, along the way, expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds. At best, the two seem like an ill-matched pair of idiots -- and at worst, as mismatched as this very bad screenplay is with the film. . This film contains graphic sex talk, near nudity and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Drama-thriller. Starring Antonio Banderas and Elena Anaya. Directed by Pedro Almodóvar. In Spanish with English subtitles. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Pedro Almodóvar is one of the few filmmakers with the ability to infuse the screen with his own consciousness, and to see The Skin I Live In is to enter into his nightmare. Like a nightmare, the film has many recognizable strains and sources, and yet the arrangement of the material, the obsessions and the points of emphasis are entirely individual.  It is the nightmare of someone steeped in cinema. Vertigo, Eyes Without a Face, Rebecca, Frankenstein and every mad doctor movie ever made, including The Island of Lost Souls, are mixed into this movie's DNA. They're not referenced - references are too easy, orderly and rational for what we see here. Rather they are all part of the air.  Or to come at this from another angle, The Skin I Live In is like a David Cronenberg horror film as made by a director who doesn't fear the body but revels in it, who is too sensual and amoral by nature to find anything truly disgusting or foreign. Almodóvar has spent a lot of time meditating on gender, on identity, on passion and on various forms of sexual expression, and all of that finds its way into this picture.  At its center is Antonio Banderas, showing much more command and presence than he ever does in his American movies, as a surgeon who specializes in facial restoration. Early in the film, with an unsettling combination of coldness and conviction, he announces that he has perfected a synthetic skin that will revolutionize the treatment of burn victims. But the skin is not really synthetic - it's a chromosomological amalgam of human and pig skin, an entirely unethical creation. Banderas' good looks and our knowledge of him as Zorro might easily distract us at the beginning from realizing that he is a mad scientist. But the hints are there in the set decoration of the doctor's mansion: Everywhere are large reproductions of famous paintings from all eras, all with one thing in common: They are nudes showing vast expanses of skin. Another fat hint, a big fat hint, that the good doctor might be out of his mind is that he is holding a woman captive in his home. Vera (Elena Anaya) wears a flesh-colored bodysuit and lives in a locked room, either the beneficiary or the victim of the doctor's skin experiments. One thing we do know, from the doctor's spooky housekeeper (Marisa Paredes): He has given Vera the face of his dead wife. And we see that he observes her on a flat, closed-circuit TV screen that's the size of a wall. The expression on his face is strangely fierce yet helpless.  As for the rest, today is not the day to reveal plot details that, as a matter of course, would have to be revealed in any serious discussion. But this much can be said: The movie's arresting quality - the strange hold of it - derives from the tension between what Almodóvar thinks about the relationship of the doctor and Vera, and how he feels about it. Intellectually, Almodóvar is horrified. But emotionally, he understands it. He is even seduced by it and, in turn, he seduces his audience. It's that specific conflict that takes The Skin I Live In out of the realm of simple horror and gives it the complexity of greatness.  Or almost greatness. In adapting the novel that served as the film's source (Thierry Jonquet's Tarantula), Almodóvar had to jump back in time and then forward again, and that juggling act, however necessary, is the one graceless note in an otherwise graceful film.  Actually, The Skin I Live In is more than graceful. It's eerily graceful. It's practically unperturbed. ",1
"Drama. Starring Aaron Kwok, Lei Hao and Tielin Zhang. Directed by Christina Yao. In Mandarin with English subtitles. (Not rated. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The amoral head of a powerful family business knows that someday he will hand over control to one of his sons. But one son is too much of a hothead, and the other is too weak. And the third son has no interest in the family. He's quiet and brooding and follows his own course. Yet just when he thinks he is out, they pull him back in. This is Christina Yao's Empire of Silver, which is epic in sweep and scale and packs in enough incident to cover two Godfather movies.  The film, set in China in 1899, is about a country at the dawn of modernity and about the struggles of a banking family trying to ride the various shifts, technological, cultural and governmental, and maintain its power. Yao keeps one eye on the specific and one eye on the general and is able to tell a story that has emotional immediacy, while always illuminating and refracting off the world outside.  The central love story, of the third son (Aaron Kwok) and a beautiful English tutor (Lei Hao), has the frustration and passion of idyllic love that is stopped almost as it starts. (The lovers like to listen to a recording of Caruso from Tosca, a neat trick in that Tosca wasn't staged until a year later. They're rich - maybe they have connections.) Kwok and Lei Hao are the heart of Empire of Silver, but also of considerable interest are the family's customs and rituals and the patterns of thought that they imply. They do scandalous things and yet feel it's important to maintain, for business purposes, an image of ascetic purity.  Yao has a painterly eye, as well as a shrewd gift for suggestion. Look at her control of the crowd scenes and those thousands upon thousands of extras. Then look again and notice how there are really only a few hundred extras, carefully shot so as to suggest multitudes. Notice as well her skillful and frightening handling of a scene in which a pack of wolves attack the third son and a colleague at a remote campfire. The wolves look like demons that materialize out of the night. In Hollywood, there are too many directors who drown in money, who have access to everything but lack vision. They create grand messes, while Yao, armed with vision and a limited budget, has created grandeur. Someone should give her a ton of money and let her show us how it's done. -- Advisory: Violence, nudity.",1
"Drama. Starring Anders Danielsen Lie. Directed by Joachim Trier. In Norwegian with English subtitles. (Not rated. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This drama, about roughly 24 hours in the life of a suicidal man, does two important things, one smart, one downright impressive. The smart thing is that it creates circumstances for the character in which suicide is at the very least an understandable option. After all, it's one thing to stand in judgment and think of suicide as an insane choice, and quite another to share in the character's despair. The man in question, Anders (Anders Danielsen Lie), is a 34-year-old drug addict who has drained his family's finances, trashed his relationships and ruined his career. Now, after six strung-out years, he's out of rehab, facing dwindling prospects and a world of shame. Just to have an OK life is going to be a brutal, ongoing struggle. The impressive thing that Oslo, August 31st does is that it somehow relates what Anders is going through to the city of Oslo in general. Anders is not a metaphor for Oslo - that would be cheap and silly. Rather, he is just one more story in the naked city, and we see him against the backdrop of other people, having quite different lives. Whenever he is on the street or in a cafe, the movie hastens to let us eavesdrop on the conversations of others. The soundscape provides a glimpse into Anders' own internal life - he feels that he is the only person around who isn't happy - even as it creates a mosaic of a city at a particular moment of time. Also worthy of note and admiration is the psychological penetration of director Joachim Trier, who keeps us aware of the emotions and perceptions of all the characters, even at those times when their perceptions are limited and differ from objective reality. Trier's handling of Anders' visit to an old friend and of Anders' job interview are almost painful in the acuity of Trier's insight and of his uncompromised instinct for the little shifts in power that are part of every conversation. ‌‌",1
"Drama. Starring Andrew Scott, Fiona Glascott and Tobias Menzies. Directed by Dover Koshashvili. (Unrated. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Probably no one reading this, or next to no one, started the week looking forward to seeing Anton Chekhov's The Duel. It's a nice, unobtrusive entry of a kind bound to slip into and out of town with little fanfare, an adaptation of a Chekhov novella with a cast of unknowns and a director that few people have heard of. And yet, if you see this movie, it will give you more pleasure and more to think about than any of the more popular entries currently out there. Of course, a duel is fought in it. We know that going in. Equally obvious, from the movie's first minutes, is who will fight the duel, though the specific path by which these two men come into conflict is the story of the film. That won't be revealed here, except to note that the men are opposites bound to clash, who see life, the world and themselves in completely opposed ways.  At the center of the movie is an illicit sexual relationship. In a remote corner of Russia, Laevsky (Andrew Scott) lives with Nadia (Fiona Glascott), who is married to another man. But as the story begins, something is making him crazy - something is burning a hole in his pocket and in his mind. He has received a letter telling him Nadia's husband is dead. That means he's going to be expected to marry her, and he wants that about as much as Amy Winehouse wants to go to rehab: He says no, no, no. Director Dover Koshashvili, screenwriter Mary Bing and not least of all Chekhov himself present Laevsky and Nadia's interaction with a fascinating precision of observation. She is superficial, flighty and amoral. He is self-absorbed, self-hating and angry. They have a recipe between them for lifelong misery, and yet, buried underneath the accumulating rubble of their relationship, there seems to be something there, a shred of possibility that they might still be happy. Meanwhile, as Laevsky heads steadily toward some kind of crackup, the young zoologist Von Koren (Tobias Menzies) is confident, sober and self-satisfied. He has purpose. He has money. He is socially at ease, and he's quite appealing, both to his colleagues and to the audience. He can express himself without going into neurotic fits, and he lives his life according to a philosophy partly derived from his observations of the natural order. Rightly, he considers himself a superior person. Not inaccurately, he considers Laevsky a pathetic, useless waste. In fact, everyone in Anton Chekhov's The Duel, whether he or she realizes it or not, is in a state of crisis. The genius of the story and the pleasure of the film is in observing the ways in which desperation reveals itself and resolves or doesn't resolve. At the heart of this film, which goes to the heart of Chekhov, is a deep understanding of human nature, human strength and human need. This is smart, inspired, no-fuss entertainment.  -- Advisory: This film contains nudity, not that that's a bad thing.",1
"Drama. Starring Anna Paquin and J. Smith-Cameron. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan. (R. 149 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Taken all in all, Margaret amounts to some kind of good movie, though to discuss it and define it inevitably involves talking about everything that's wrong with it.  It's 149 minutes long, which is insane and yet that spaciousness is so linked to the movie's appealing languor and unforced narrative style that it probably couldn't have been more than 15 minutes shorter. It features a protagonist - a teenager played by Anna Paquin - who starts off spunky and ends up so repellent as to make you loathe the sight of her. Most of all, you will dread the sound of her voice. This actually could have been the filmmaker's intention, which is interesting but weird.  Margaret was filmed in 2005 and has been held up ever since by a combination of artistic confusion and litigation. It is in no way an easy movie. Writer-director Kenneth Lonergan, who made You Can Count On Me to great success in 2000, bit off more than he could chew with this film - an ambitious, novelistic, sprawling story that attempts to show a young woman's internal development while simultaneously conveying the soul of modern-day New York. Lonergan was never going to succeed. The only question was whether he'd fail in a good way or blow himself up. Loving or hating the movie hinges on which of the two you think he did. The title refers to the Gerard Manley Hopkins poem, Spring and Fall: To a Young Child, which deals with a girl's first real awareness of mortality. In the poem, the girl's name is Margaret. In the movie, it's Lisa Cohen (Paquin), who witnesses a New York City bus crash and for the rest of the movie deals with her own guilt - she distracted the driver (Mark Ruffalo), resulting in a woman's death.  The movie features a series of accurate and frustrating confrontations between Lisa and her mother (J. Smith-Cameron, whose performance is a highlight). Lonergan is very good at showing how people block communication. Along the way, many famous faces turn up - including Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno and Matt Damon - all looking better than the last time you saw them, but that's because you're looking at 2005.  A half hour before the finish, Margaret loses altitude and starts looking for a place, any place, to land. Instead it crashes, in slow motion. But up until then, Margaret is committed and unusual. Approach it as an encounter with a set of characters in a given time and place, as something offering a mood and arresting situations, and you'll be positioned to appreciate it.",1
"Drama. Starring Brie Larson, John Gallagher Jr. and Kaitlyn Dever. Directed by Destin Creton. (R. 96 minutes.) Short Term 12, which mostly takes place inside a foster-care facility, has a special atmosphere. Its mood is melancholic and thoughtful, very much focused on the quiet interactions and movements within people and on the culture of the place as a whole. The teenagers who live there are supervised by workers in their early and mid-20s. And more than the young leading the young, there is a quality of the wounded leading the freshly wounded. This atmosphere - partly sad, and yet energetic, because everyone there is so young - is half of what's memorable about Short Term 12. This place, which most of us have never thought of, becomes specific and real, such that we can know we would not wish to live there and yet can see that it's a home. The residents are like the kids. The young people on the staff, male and female, are like mothers, and the unseen authorities - the people who work in the offices making decisions - are like remote, authoritarian fathers, objects of respect and legitimate fear. The other half of what makes Short Term 12 memorable is Brie Larson as Grace, one of the workers. She makes us believe that she really has the gift for this - of caring, of authority, of knowing when to discipline and when to let up. Grace has a wisdom and gravity beyond her years, which means that she has a history. That history, gradually revealed, becomes essential to the movie. The opening scene, seemingly casual, seemingly tossed off, sets up the story effortlessly. The attendants are taking a break, and Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) is regaling his colleagues with an anecdote at his own expense. Through it, we come to understand the rules of this facility. Basically, the attendants, if they catch a kid trying to escape, can subdue him and bring him back. But once a resident clears the fence, the attendants have no authority. They cannot lay a finger on anyone beyond the gate. Much of Short Term 12 is like that opening. The illusion is that you're just seeing life unfold in this odd place, where deep need barely covers surface levity. But director Destin Creton is following a tight structure. His film has an intricate design, and every part of it is leading to one direction - toward putting pressure, awful pressure, on his heroine.  Specifically, the movie takes Grace, the most levelheaded and competent of individuals, and gives her three profound sources of acute, inescapable stress: her relationship with Mason, her longtime boyfriend; her relationship with her father, which has been nothing but a source of horrific pain and misery; and the case of one of the residents, a teenage girl (Kaitlyn Dever), in whom she sees her younger self.  Among the wonders of Larson's performance is in how she shows the near unraveling of this person. She is borderline unhinged in dealing with a psychiatrist who releases a girl back into the custody of her abusive father. As Grace gets more desperate, Larson is always convincing, her thoughts always legible. Any director who sees Short Term 12 will want to cast Larson in something. This movie puts her on the map. But don't forget John Gallagher Jr., as her remarkably sweet boyfriend, through whose eyes we see Grace. He's the other half of her best scenes, and he makes Larson's work possible.",1
"Drama. Starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Evans. Directed by Jodie Markell. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Bryce Dallas Howard is not comfortable as a Southern flapper in The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond. She gets the shape of the role. She gets a nice chunk of its emotion, and she gets about half of its music. The Tennessee Williams dialogue - director Jodie Markell made it from a previously unproduced screenplay - sounds strained coming from Howard, who never quite finds the places where the ornate artifice of Williams' poetry overlaps with the truth of his emotions. Yet even though Howard never quite gets it, never quite releases into the role and never quite convinces, she never makes a mistake, either. She doesn't take the role in any wrong directions, and so we get a decent outline of who this Southern flapper is supposed to be. Think of this as an intelligent sketch by a good actress who could have filled in the outlines were she allowed to rehearse for months and perform the role multiple times in front of an audience. Fisher (Howard) is a rich heiress in Tennessee, who finds herself declasse among the smart set, because her businessman father has done something criminal and scandalous. She needs someone to accompany her to Memphis parties, and so she chooses one of her family's employees - Jimmy, a poor boy from a good family. For once, Chris Evans (Push, Fantastic Four) gets to play something besides an idiot. The story takes a while to set up, but at its center is a vivid party scene, which turns into an agonizing series of humiliations for our young heroine. Ann-Margret appears in a thankless role, as Fisher's repressed aunt, but Ellen Burstyn gets to shine in two strong scenes as a bedridden woman who can't wait to die. Also noteworthy is young actress Jessica Collins, who appears as Vinnie, a poor but dishonest and angry young woman, who hates Fisher on sight. There's something supposedly unlovable about Fisher, also a little crazy. Howard fails to rope in these aspects of the character. But Howard does bring home Fisher's strength, and Fisher's physical abandon comes through beautifully in the scene in which she dances, by herself, with all the excitement and impetuousness of the Jazz Age.Williams wrote The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond in the mid-1950s, and compared with his other works from this era, it's minor. But this film is the closest we're going to get to anything new by Williams, and it's a respectable effort.-- Advisory: Adult themes.",1
"Drama. Starring Campbell Scott, Hope Davis and Denis Leary. Directed by Alan Rudolph. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) then have a very spicy meal, the resulting nightmare would be very much like the films Alan Rudolph has been churning out recently. For most of the past 10 years, this talented director has been stuck in a self-imitative hell of long, improvisatory scenes and nonsense plots, but with The Secret Life of Dentists,  he pulls himself out of a death spiral, with the estimable help of screenwriter Craig Lucas. Lucas himself has a laudable filmography. In the early '90s, with his personal and professional partner Norman Rene, he made a handful of penetrating films dealing with delicate human emotions, including Prelude to a Kiss and Longtime Companion. With The Secret life of Dentists, a melancholy, well-observed film about a middle-class marriage collapsing under the stress of numbing routine, both Rudolph and Lucas find a subject worthy of their incisive humanity. Based on a short story (The Age of Grief) by Jane Smiley, the film is about a married couple in their late 30s, David (Campbell Scott) and Dana (Hope Davis), who have three little daughters and share a dental practice. David, a contained, methodical type, is content with his lot, while Dana is restless. She sings with an amateur opera company and longs for something transcendent. Her longing and emotional distance gradually convince David that she is having an affair. Denis Leary plays a cranky dental patient who becomes an imaginary alter ego for David as he ruminates about his wife's alleged infidelity. Lucas' script captures the intimacy of marriage and the ways in which married couple can easily fall into a pattern of irritation and recrimination. The film presents a realistic and artful treatment of a subject not often dealt with in cinema -- and rarely with honesty. Davis and Scott respond with heartfelt, edgy performances. . This film contains sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy. Starring Bob Dylan, John Goodman, Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. Directed and written by Larry Charles. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At the Embarcadero, Act One/Act Two in Berkeley, Aquarius in Palo Alto and Camera in San Jose.) . Few are the celebrities who enjoy their fame as little as Bob Dylan. Forty years in the public eye have given the master songwriter a wariness that verges on hostility. Take a look into those wounded, suspicious eyes and you don't find a mirror to his soul -- just a bitter warning to keep your distance. That's why Dylan, an occasional actor (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid), was cast as Jack Fate, the crusty, inscrutable troubadour in Masked and Anonymous. A messy, ambitious comedy from Seinfeld writer Larry Charles, Masked spins out an apocalyptic yarn in which Jack, rock legend and son of a dying dictator, is sprung from jail to perform at a benefit concert. Dylan plays himself in Masked and Anonymous, which is fine in the musical numbers -- they're easily the best thing in the movie -- but disastrous in the dialogue scenes. Void of inflection, Dylan doesn't act, but stands and looks uneasy in whatever space the camera is pointing. The deadness in his eyes stops the movie cold. The dialogue is made of riddles, scrambled poetry and apocalyptic mumbo- jumbo. All of us are in some way trying to kill time, Jack muses. When all's said and done, time ends up killing us. Charles gathered an impressive supporting cast, most of whom work below their level. John Goodman is Uncle Sweetheart, the blustering yahoo who used to manage Jack; Jessica Lange is a sleazy, lacquered concert promoter; and Jeff Bridges is the snoopy reporter who hounds Jack. There's barely a speaking part that isn't played by a familiar name: Penelope Cruz as Bridges' girlfriend, Angela Bassett as a hooker, Val Kilmer as a snake handler, Sean Penn and Christian Slater as roadies, plus Mickey Rourke, Luke Wilson, Giovanni Ribisi and Cheech Marin. Then there's Ed Harris, playing a white minstrel in blackface. Why? I don't know. It's best to not think about it. . This movie contains some raw language. -- Edward Guthmann . Director Nabil Ayouch takes a subject that could be thoroughly depressing (the life of street kids in Morocco's port city of Casablanca) and -- through a simple story line, dramatic acting and National Geographic-like shots of the city's rough and pristine edges -- creates cinematic magic. This isn't to say that Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets is some sort of saccharine fable that sanitizes the extremes of homelessness. In fact, those extremes are on display: the drug use, the violence, the hustling for money, the despair and dishevelment. But Ayouch does a remarkable thing: He centers the film on three indelible characters who, in trying to honor a dead friend, reveal more about the world than a thousand Disney films ever could. Kwita (Mounim Kbab), Omar (Mustapha Hansali) and Boubker (Hicham Moussoune) are distraught that gang members have killed Ali Zaoua (Abdelhak Zhayra), and they vow to bury him like a prince. Kwita is the boy who masterminds the idea, but his resolve doesn't always match his courage, so it's Omar who works his way into Ali's old house, where Ali's mother (Amal Ayouch) works as a prostitute. Just finished with a customer, she says that Ali lied when he claimed she'd wanted to sell his eyes for profit. More truths are revealed, which help explain Ali's obsession with becoming a sailor and living on an island far from Casablanca. Before the trio's quest is over, Kwita meets a girl he falls for (meets is being kind -- he steals her wallet) and visits a cemetery where his lack of religious training (I went to a mosque once) is criticized; Omar briefly returns to his former gang, which instigated Ali's murder; and Boubker -- the smallest and most vulnerable of the three -- threatens to kill himself but recovers his sense of self and helps an old fisherman (Mohamed Majd) on his boat. (The scene where Boubker tries to buy nails in a hardware store is priceless.) These kids, who smoke cigarettes, sniff glue and sleep on a lonely pier, all have dreams for a better life. Their friend's cruel death lets them -- perhaps for the first time in their lives -- try to effect a major, positive change. Like Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay (another drama that deals with children on the street), Ali Zaoua succeeds on a profound level. Ayoub, a Moroccan director whose movie has won awards at more than 40 international film festivals, uses bits of animation to bolster a story that will bring tears and smiles to new audiences in the United States. . This film contains strong language and scenes of sex and violence that are not suitable for children. -- Jonathan Curiel . Lucia, a writer of children's books, dips in and out of fiction in her own life, the line blurring so often that it's hard to tell what's real and what's fantasy in Lucia, Lucia. It's even harder to care. Mexican filmmaker Antonio Serrano applies the fantasy device so haphazardly as to render it irritating instead of surprising. He fills the movie with anticlimaxes: People revealed to be crooks are revealed to be crooks again, and flagging story lines stretch forever. The tone is also random, shifting from farce to telenovela camp to serious thriller. This mess still has moments because of fine performances by Almodovar veteran Cecilia Roth (All About My Mother) as the writer and Carlos Alvarez Novoa as a widowed neighbor and political exile who fought against Franco. The older man and a young neighbor (Kuno Becker) befriend Lucia when her husband is kidnapped. Or has he been kidnapped? Lucia, Lucia creates a secret life for the missing husband, a civil servant with a surprising stash of cash. This might all be a function of Lucia's desire for excitement. Negotiating with the kidnappers certainly has invigorated her. To see Roth -- possessed of pop-out eyes, a raspy scream and an endlessly watchable face -- invigorated is really something. But some rather undramatic reality/fantasy transformations stunt character and actress. Whereas the real woman lives in a small, drab apartment, the fantasy woman lives in a small, tastefully decorated apartment. Way to dream. Lucia, Lucia gives the lie to the hopeful idea that all movies coming out of Mexico are original and vibrant, though it sometimes echoes the artful immediacy of films like Amores Perros and Y Tu Mama Tambien. A perfectly composed shot of Roth sitting on a hay bale seems to exist only to highlight the actress' red hair, and a road trip involving Lucia and her two pals evokes the Y Tu Mama road trip. Except one guy is 70 and looks like Don Quixote. The film's only mystery lies in Lucia's sudden friendship with these two guys, a threesome so fishy it might be imagined. The young stud seems almost too available to Lucia. Their romantic sparring carries no sparks, especially when he tells her he likes the wrinkles around her eyes. Her response is to kiss him passionately -- and that's in the part of the film that's supposed to be reality. Ross has greater chemistry with the wonderful Alvarez Novoa, whose kind eyes and slumped shoulders signal enduring hope after a lifetime of taking hits. Yet their characters remain platonic. Pairing the mid-40s Roth with an older man wasn't the sexy choice, but it would have been the wise one. . This film contains nudity, strong sexuality, violence. -- Carla Meyer ",1
"Drama. Starring Denis Lavant, Edith Scob and Eva Mendes. Directed by Leos Carax. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 115 minutes.) The latest from the eccentric French director, Leos Carax, is a thoroughly unclassifiable film about a man who rides around in a limousine, going from appointment to appointment, assuming a completely different identity at each stop. He starts off the day as a white-haired executive, but that, too, is an act. He applies makeup and becomes a beggar woman; later, he is a freak who lives under the sewer.  On two occasions, he seems to kill somebody. On one occasion, he commits suicide, but then he's alive afterward. As an old man, he has an elaborate deathbed scene, then leaps up for his next appointment. As a middle-aged man, he browbeats his teenage daughter for lying to him.  You will look in vain for some definite logic to Holy Motors. You could see it as a metaphor for the actor's life, or a story about the desire to transcend the self. Anything you decide is fine. By far, the most important thing about Holy Motors is that, though there is madness in it, there is none of the insufferable French whimsy that you find in, say, the worst films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, Micmacs). The sensibility here is tough, and though it's unclear exactly what this movie is saying, whatever it's saying is not reassuring. It has nothing to do with cute. Carax asks nothing of the audience - no indulgence, no patience, no love. Denis Lavant, who plays the lead character, never presumes upon the viewer's affections. He remains reserved, distant from us. At the same time, Carax gives us nothing, at least nothing but an interesting movie. He offers no explanations and no excuses. In this way, he's a little like Bunuel. Ultimately, it seems that some kind of statement about cinema is at play in Holy Motors. Edith Scob, who plays the chauffeur, was the title character in Eyes Without a Face many years ago, and at one point she wears the white mask that she wore in that film. Cinema is full, life is empty. Cinema is easy, life is mysterious. Perhaps that's Carax's message. Whatever it is, he has our attention.",1
"Drama. Starring Elle Fanning, Alice Englert, Christina Hendricks and Alessandro Nivola. Directed by Sally Potter. (PG-13. 90 minutes.) Sally Potter's twin interests - in grand world movements and in the grand internal movements in people lives - are effectively brought to bear in Ginger & Rosa, her best film of the decade. It tells the story of two teenage girls in London, best friends since birth, as they go through a series of personal crises, while the world outside has a crisis of its own - a big one. Something to do with missiles and Cuba, Kennedy and Khrushchev. The year is 1962, and as things stand, there might not be a 1963.  Philosophy is, at its core, the study of how one should live one's life in the face of death. So an international crisis like this makes everyone a philosopher. Everyone is forced to assess what they value, what they want, and what they consider to be important. Ginger (Elle Fanning), the main focus of the movie, chooses political activism; Rosa chooses an immersion in pleasure. Ginger's mother (Christina Hendricks) is too responsible and too in despair to choose anything, while her dangerously charming husband (Alessandro Nivola) becomes reinforced in his determination to leave her. You can see Ginger & Rosa as a critique of 1960s hedonism. Potter depicts its flowering, while presenting it, in hindsight, as a philosophical dead-end. But to describe the movie in this way makes it sound too dry. There are big emotions at work in Ginger & Rosa, and the performances are exceptional. Elle Fanning, as Ginger, not only sounds English, but her whole manner is suffused with Englishness, so that at moments she seems like a young Judi Dench. She and Hendricks, as her mother, go to some bleak and wrenching places in Ginger & Rosa and return with the best work of their lives. ",1
"Drama. Starring Ethan Hawke, Kristin Scott Thomas and Joanna Kulig. Directed by Pawel Pawlikowski. In English and in French with English subtitles. (R. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This movie is not recommended for people who need to know what's going on. The Woman in the Fifth, an English and French language film from the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski, is watchable and enjoyable, but it's fairly impenetrable, and it gets more peculiar as it goes along. Based on the novel by Douglas Kennedy, it stars Ethan Hawke as a fish-out-of-water American in Paris, a once-promising writer whose life has derailed. His French wife has a restraining order against him and won't let him see their 6-year-old daughter. He is robbed on a bus and ends up staying in a flophouse and working as a night watchman - in a part of Paris no tourist ever sees. Things seem to get a bit better when he meets a fascinating widow, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, who speaks English here but acts the way she does in her French movies. That is, sexy and insinuating. He also meets a beautiful young waitress, played by Joanna Kulig, the Polish actress best known for her role in Elles. Actually, it's quite possible that The Woman in the Fifth is not impenetrable, after all, just really, really weird. It depends on how you choose to see the film and what you understand to be reality. To say more than that would say too much. But I'm voting for really, really weird. In any case, Ethan Hawke's performance - sympathetic, in pain, sensitive, and on edge - leaves open all possibilities.‌",1
"Drama. Starring Freida Pinto and Riz Ahmed. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. In English and in Hindi with English subtitles. (R. 117 minutes.) Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles is updated to modern India, in Trishna, a subdued but well-observed adaptation from director Michael Winterbottom. The subtitle of Hardy's novel was A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented, and that's the approach taken here. Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire) plays the title character, a dirt poor girl from a desperate family. She meets a rich young man, Jay, who takes a sympathetic interest in her, and the evolution of their relationship - with everything it implies about the influence of money and class - forms the story.  Winterbottom gives a bright panorama of Indian life, from the agrarian countryside to the tumult of Jaipur and the sophistication of Mumbai. As a traditional culture in the midst of the 21st century, India allows many of the 19th century social conventions, described by Hardy, to be transferred more or less intact. Moreover, the naked simplicity of Trishna, as played by Pinto, feels almost like something from another time.  The interaction between Trishna and the young rich man, played by Riz Ahmed, is a contrast between poverty and privilege, but also between the old and the new, the rural and the urban, the transparent and the occluded. Pinto's performance has an affecting purity, but Ahmed is impressive, as well, for the way he can make an audience uneasy, even when he is acting benevolent.  We can see Trishna - it's clear who she is, what she wants, what's true and special about her. But there's something in Ahmed's performance that suggests that Jay either doesn't see these things or is willfully averting his eyes from those depths he himself doesn't possess. It makes for an unsettling dynamic that Winterbottom explores in uncompromising detail.",1
"Drama. Starring Gael Garcia Bernal, Alfredo Castro and Antonia Zegers. Directed by Pablo Larrain. In Spanish with English subtitles. (R. 118 minutes.) No is a Chilean drama about the 1988 election by which Chilean voters got to decide whether to retain or dismiss the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. It was a yes or no vote - or Si or No. The film is a semi-fictional account of the No campaign, from its inception through the election. At center is Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, in the composite role of Rene, a slick advertising man whose crucial insight is that the No campaign needs to be positive. For the first time ever, the Pinochet government is allowing for opposition advertising - 15 minutes every night for almost four weeks - and the impulse of every political dissident is to present a litany of the regime's horrors. But Rene insists on a future-based, upbeat campaign, associating the No vote with things like youth, rebellion and happiness. He wants to sell No the way he might sell a new soft drink. No has some of the advantages of a documentary, in that it contains many of the actual commercials that were used in 1988, both Si and No. The late 1980s was still pre-digital, so the blurred graininess makes the vintage of these advertisements apparent. The drama is just an added benefit, but it never quite rises to the level of compelling, and as a result, the movie loses a certain propulsion, here and there. Still, it always retains a level of interest, especially for those of us who don't remember - or aren't old enough to remember - which side won. In Chile, the dilemma for voters opposed to the regime was that they didn't know whether they should even vote in the first place. It was assumed that Pinochet would fix the election, so that the act of voting would be akin to participating in a fraud. The challenge was to convince people that change was possible and that they should vote; hence, the need for some positive uplift in the opposition's advertising. Bernal is quite good as the young media specialist - it's always surprising to see how strong a presence he is in his Spanish-language films and how he all-but disappears in his American films. Is it a matter of the roles or the language? The jury is still out. Between the lines of this Oscar nominee for best foreign film is a sophisticated understanding of the actual choice Chile faced in 1988. Though it's pretty clear that life under a repressive military dictatorship was the worst alternative, No has a healthy cynicism about the future the other side was offering, too. The soft-drink-style advertising was just the hint of it.What follows repression usually isn't a golden age, but a time for embracing trivia, for people to relax and concentrate on all that is silly. And why shouldn't they? They've earned the right.",1
"Drama. Starring Glenn Close, Dermot Mulroney, Patricia Clarkson and Alex House. Directed by Rose Troche. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) At least Troche gives each actor a moment to shine. Thus, The Safety of Objects has a better cast than it deserves: Glenn Close as Esther, a mother who spends most of her time tending to her comatose teenage son; and Dermot Mulroney as a lawyer who, after years of hard work, is denied a partnership in his firm. The lawyer reacts by behaving irrationally -- or, to be precise, like an entirely different character from an entirely different story. He becomes obsessed with helping Esther win an SUV in a local contest. Why? It is not for the audience to reason why, but to sit and absorb the human drama. Patricia Clarkson, who can do no wrong lately, plays the liveliest character, or maybe the liveliness is all Clarkson's. She's a randy middle- aged mom going through a divorce that, if only it were friendlier, might be called acrimonious. Clarkson gives a convincing performance as a woman whose basic life-loving nature is still discernible, despite a patch of misery, tragedy and financial strain. But the work Troche does with Clarkson can't compensate for the ultimate purposelessness of the film. Despite its title, The Safety of Objects is not about what happens to people when their investment in material things proves fruitless. The movie could just as easily have been called The Safety of Human Relationships or It's Unsafe to Be Alive. It's about random people doing random things and having random sorrows. - This film contains strong language. -- Mick LaSalle . The Son is a shrewd, highly controlled little film from Belgium that builds to an unexpected emotional climax. Though distant and almost documentary-like in style, it never stops bringing us deeper into the characters' world and into their pain. The film reveals passionate undercurrents through deadpan means, in a way reminiscent of no other film I can think of -- with the exception of La Promesse from 1996, from the same filmmaking brothers, Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne. The Son represents an elaboration of the La Promesse aesthetic, or rather a stripping-down of it to essentials. The camera stays tight on Olivier Gourmet, who plays a woodworking instructor in a vocational training center. In almost every shot, a handheld camera films him from his shoulders up, subjecting him to a scrutiny we rarely encounter onscreen. The scrutiny pays off, for soon we're able to read into the face of this unsmiling man an underlying sorrow and a humane spirit. The Dardenne brothers were originally documentarians, and it shows in the time they devote to the intricacies of the woodworking process. But not every documentarian can evoke from such scenes a sense of something holy taking place, that through the teaching of these young men, the instructor, however curt and abrupt, is imparting something precious and necessary. The film's title refers to a real son, but it's also a Christian allusion, which gradually seems entirely apt. Eventually, a 16-year-old named Francis (Morgan Marinne) enters the vocational school, and the instructor is thrown off his stride. He seems conflicted and preoccupied and wants to know the boy's story, though he remains relatively unchanged in his outward manner. Obviously, there is some past connection, and the story of The Son is of how that connection is revealed. Gourmet is brilliant, conveying the decency of a decent man who has no idea how good he is, who merely acts on gruff instinct. As the boy, Marinne is ideally cast -- a pretty face, but with heavy-lidded eyes and a dull expression suggesting a clouded consciousness. - This film contains strong language. -- Mick LaSalle . Amen, the new film from the director Costa-Gavras, deals with an important aspect of Holocaust history, the failure of the Catholic Church to denounce Hitler, and it does so with gravity, detail and seriousness of purpose. Unfortunately, structural flaws and a built-in lack of suspense keep it from being nearly as moving as it was intended to be. At first Amen seems to be the portrait of one man, Kurt Gerstein, an affable SS officer, if such a fellow can be imagined. Gerstein is an expert on disinfecting clothes and purifying water, and he is somewhat mystified when the concentration camp captains keep ordering excessive numbers of Zyklon-B canisters, when it takes only one to disinfect a whole barracks. Then he finds out what they're being used for, when he visits a camp and sees the mass gassing of Jews with his own eyes. Gerstein was a real-life historical figure who did what he could to thwart the Holocaust, but, as we know, he couldn't do all that much. The movie is on yet weaker ground when it switches its focus from Gerstein to a fictional Catholic priest (Mathieu Kassovitz) and his efforts to persuade the pope to tell the world about Nazi atrocities. Amen is a rather dry film, but to the extent we're seeing history, it at least seems worthwhile. But when we see Gerstein having adventures with the fictional priest, or see the priest on his own, the movie loses some of its justification. It's neither true history nor a character portrait. Instead, it's an expose of the Catholic hierarchy in a state of mind-boggling paralysis, presented in a fictional context that, inevitably, dulls its edge and makes us question its accuracy. - This film contains violence. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Drama. Starring Jacques Gamblin and Jean Aurenche. Directed by Bertrand Tavernier. (Not rated. 163 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The occupying Nazis had their hand in the product, mainly on the business end, but while some films could be considered collaborationist, most were merely apolitical entertainment, on which future greats and near-greats of the French cinema worked. In Safe Conduct, Bertrand Tavernier pays tribute to the generation of filmmakers that proceeded him, with a sprawling but personal epic that depicts the French film industry between 1942 and 1944. He concentrates mainly on the activities of assistant director and resistance fighter Jean Devaivre (Jacques Gamblin) and the womanizing screenwriter Jean Aurenche (Denis Podalydes). Along the way, he creates an atmosphere and a feeling -- a kind of business-as- usual sense in the midst of madness -- that lends itself authentically to the film's swings between farce and tragedy. That Tavernier understands the soul of this era is obvious from the movie's first moments, in which we see Aurenche preparing for a rendezvous with a married actress. Nothing is overdone, but there's a comic edge to the assignation -- until moments later, when the British air force starts dropping bombs. Walls cave in, glass shatters, fires ignite. This is life during wartime, careening from mundane to the horrible, from the absurd to the grave. Aurenche is something of a comic figure, going from address to address, staying on the move so as not to be forced to write anything he considers collaborationist. Devaivre is more traditionally heroic, a talented technician whose real love is film, but whose compassion leads him, inexorably, into dangerous political activity. Though it runs 163 minutes, Safe Conduct is anything but languorous. It's packed to bursting with incident, and with scores of characters, some fictional, some from history. The details feel authentic: The empty Paris streets, the profanation of German anti-aircraft guns atop belle epoque buildings. And Devaivre's adventures provide high tension. This film contains sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle  Documentary. Starring Mark Moskowitz. Directed by Mark Moskowitz. (Not rated. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . In 1972, Mark Moskowitz read a rave review of a new novel called The Stones of Summer by a first-time author named Dow Mossman. The 18-year-old Moskowitz waited for the paperback, bought the book, but couldn't get into it. Then, a quarter of a century later, he picked up the book again and fell in love with it. He discovered what he believed to be a masterpiece. Thus begins the saga of The Stone Reader, a heartfelt but somewhat bloated documentary that's partly an homage and partly a literary mystery. Moskowitz has a good story to tell. After an Internet search reveals that Mossman has written nothing in the years since, Moskowitz decides to find the author and find out why. Along the way, he interviews a host of literary professionals and discovers that one-shot literary wonders are actually quite common. The Stone Reader has going for it Moskowitz's hard-driving enthusiasm. Love the movie, hate it or feel somewhere in between, anyone who sees The Stone Reader leaves wanting to buy The Stones of Summer immediately. Alas, it's out of print. But Moskowitz indulgences himself too often at the expense of audience patience. He tells us about his life. We're not interested. He takes us to his mother's house. Who cares? At several points, Moskowitz travels in search of someone who might have known Mossman, and each time he shows us the process of his getting there -- usually by car, sometimes by plane. Plus, half the interviews turn out to be a bust. Most of his subjects have never heard of Mossman. As he was making the film, Moskowitz didn't know if he'd ever solve the Mossman mystery, and perhaps that's why he tried to shape his documentary into a general exploration of literary struggle. Understandable. But, in the editing, Mossman knew he had indeed solved it, so why leave so much extraneous matter and so many pointless interviews in the final cut? -- Mick LaSalle Animated musical. Voices by John Fiedler, Jim Cummings and Kath Soucie. Directed by Francis Glebas. Screenplay adapted from the words of A.A. Milne by Brian Hohlfield. (G. 75 minutes. At AMC Van Ness and UA Colma.) . The Winnie the Pooh books and movies are a kid-friendly franchise, the kind of content that is both witty and clever, but free of bathroom humor. Mean things rarely happen to nice people in the Hundred Acre Wood, and if they do, it is all a misunderstanding. You won't see Pooh trying to get even or holding a grudge. Such goodie-goodie fare could make your teeth ache if it weren't for the sly humor that A.A. Milne slipped into his books. The challenge is bringing that sense of fun to the screen. Sometimes it works -- Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day won a well-deserved Oscar in 1968 -- and sometimes it looks like they are just going through the motions. That's what happens here. Some of it may be the thin volumes that form the Pooh legacy. There aren't a lot of stories or characters. Pooh, the bear of little brain, has been done, there was The Tigger Movie' in 2001, and now we are down to attempting to create a star turn for poor little Piglet. Let's be honest, even the kindest and most generous resident of the Hundred Acre Wood has to admit that Piglet is a little needy. A tiny pink pig in a knitted sweater, he (she?) is relentlessly game, a faithful friend and a plucky pal. But Piglet is forever having his feelings hurt, or suffering a crisis of self-esteem. While kids (and adults) can relate, the sunny optimism of Pooh, or the swagger and bravado of Tigger is more upbeat. Piglet's movie gets the stories from the books that were passed over before, and it is easy to see why. In one of them Kanga and Roo arrive unexpectedly to live in the Wood and are met with resentment. If we didn't know better we might see this as an attempt by residents to drive an outsider out of the neighborhood. Not to mention that Kanga is a single mother. The animation, as always, is Disney-perfect, but somewhere the humor has been lost. This is harmless fun for the kindergarten crowd, but even they will notice that the Blustery Day video they've been playing at home is a lot better. As for adults, try not to notice that, when he stammers, Pooh sounds a little like Ozzy Osbourne. -- C.W. Nevius  Comedy. Directed by Kurt Voss. (R. 85 minutes. At the Galaxy.) . In Portland, Ore., four renegade chicks start a band called the Paper Dolls. Their music rocks, but the band disintegrates from the usual gamut of cat fights, booze and drugs, sexual betrayal and jealous lovers. Down & Out With the Dolls, a low-budget movie from writer-director Kurt Voss (Sugar Town), doesn't add much depth or irony to that setup, but offers a quartet of grrrl rockers who squabble, snarl and share a funky Portland rental they dub the Dollhouse. Zoe Poledouris stands out as lead singer Fauna, a scheming wench with attitude. Fauna lies, raises a stink when the house supply of Tampons runs out and then steals the cute boyfriend (Coyote Shivers) of guitarist Kali (Nicole Barrett). We also meet level-headed bassist Lavender (Melody Moore) and drummer Reggie (Kinnie Star), a sexually ambivalent heel who disses her wimpy skater boyfriend (Brendan O'Hara) and casually dumps her lesbian girlfriend (Sierra Feldner-Shaw). The Paper Dolls start humbly, playing at a backyard barbecue, then cinch a recording deal and inevitably self-immolate as wicked Fauna spreads her snail trail of abuse and mendacity. A lot of the acting is amateurish, and most of the plot feels like a rehash of a rehash. The music, written and performed in the spirit of L7, is small consolation. This film contains partial nudity, sexual situations and raw language. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"Drama. Starring Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson. Directed by John Madden. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)What a drag it is getting old - especially for the generation that once went around singing, What a drag it is getting old. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a movie about a specific variety of old age, what could be called early old age. The characters in this latest film from John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) are not decrepit, and most still have romantic aspirations. Yet they have the sense that time is getting shorter, as well as a bewildered awareness that the world might be passing them by, or getting ready to. And as they are from a culture and an era that values youth, they see no compensation in old age and can't even pretend at any wisdom beyond resignation. The film brings together a handful of people from various conditions of life and places them in a funky old hotel in the hectic Indian city of Jaipur. Some of the residents are broke and think they might want to settle in India, where Western money goes far, and some are there for other reasons. If there is an unintended lesson in this movie, it's this old favorite: Don't get old with no money. Provide, provide.There are two other possible lessons: India's a colorful place for a travelogue, and Dev Patel, who plays the hyper hotel manager, has more in him than Slumdog Millionaire. Perhaps I should admit that a part of me just wants to keep The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel at a distance, because there is something about it so glum and hangdog - and hangdog in that distinctly British, expect-nothing-from-life sort of way - that I'd rather not believe it. I'd rather not believe that just being 70, for example, is so inherently miserable that it gives people no choice but to be contemplative, angry or pathetic. In this case, we define pathetic as seemingly happy, but in a way that incites pity, not envy. Yet Marigold Hotel is too well made to be dismissed and contains too much truth to be scorned. Based on a novel by Deborah Moggach, the screenplay takes a half-dozen stories and mingles them, and yet each character's through-line is effective on its own. There's Tom Wilkinson, quite moving as a man who returns to India after 40 years to seek out the lover of his youth. There's Judi Dench - truly lovely and completely open here - as a grieving widow with money troubles. And Maggie Smith, as a former maid (with the demeanor of a duchess) recovering from a hip replacement. Less cuddly, but easily as interesting, is Penelope Wilton as a bitter, status-conscious woman who is so mired in negativity that she can't escape it. Even when she tries to sound festive, something hostile or twisted comes out of her mouth. As horrible as she is, you end up feeling sorry for her, because you can tell she can't stop, and you can almost feel, physically, her self-disgust. Bill Nighy plays her poor husband, slinking about like someone pounded thin by years of abuse. Along the way, the movie provides a detailed glimpse of Jaipur - the buses and bicycles, the livestock in the street, the zigzagging traffic. Visually arresting, but once again: Save for retirement; you don't want to live there. Mixed in with the old folks, the movie follows the story of the would-be innkeeper (Patel) and the girl he wants to marry (Tena Desae), and so the cycle of passion goes on and on. It never stops. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a rare reminder from movies that the grand emotions are not only for the young and the middle-aged. They're the sweetness and torment of life until the last light goes out.",1
"Drama. Starring Juliette Binoche and William Shimell. Directed by Abbas Kiarostami. In French and Italian with English subtitles, and in English. (Unrated. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Even an austere art film needs visceral appeal, and the gut level kick of Certified Copy is that it's very like going out on a virtual date with Juliette Binoche - or for that matter, her co-star William Shimell. In this way, despite its philosophical ruminations on reality and artifice, Certified Copy is also a kind of middle-aged answer to the Before Sunrise and Before Sunset movies, with two attractive people walking around a beautiful European location, in this case Tuscany, talking nonstop and getting to know each other. The unique innovation of this film, however, is that the more we watch, the less sure we are about the relationship we're watching. Are these people two strangers discovering fascinating clashes and affinities, or have they known each other for years? Are they, in fact, husband and wife? The actual truth of the situation is, I think, easy enough to discern, and it has nothing to do with alternate universes or anything remotely supernatural. But director Abbas Kiarostami never completely spells things out, assuming audiences can think for themselves and appreciate all the film's subtleties and reverberations. Let's hope he's right.  Shimell, an operatic baritone making an assured film debut, plays a British art critic, flogging the Italian translation of his recent book at a speaking appearance. James (Shimell) believes in the virtues of originality and says that a good copy of an artwork is as good as the original. (How he stretches that one idea into a whole book must be left to the imagination.) Binoche, as a French-born local shopkeeper, takes an interest in the reserved, prickly author and offers to show him around Tuscany - at least until it's time for him to catch his train that evening. The conversation is rich, and the personal dynamic - between the cool, English academic and the earthy, somewhat scattered and voluble French woman - is arresting, in that there's often some tension between them, a conversational offer that's not reciprocated, or an idea that's rejected. It's curious that the movie is at its best when absolutely nothing is happening but two people having a conversation.  Later, as the picture becomes a Petrie dish in which James' theories are put to the ultimate test, Certified Copy loses some of its magic, but it retains interest as an appealing and one-of-a-kind experience.-- Advisory: Adult talk.",1
"Drama. Starring Karin Viard and Marina Fois. Directed by Maiwenn. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A huge hit in France, Polisse marks the maturation of writer-director Maiwenn Le Besco (known as just Maiwenn professionally). Having developed her own raw and immediate style over two previous features, the director puts it all together here, in a fascinating multicharacter drama about the police who work in Paris' child protection unit.  These are cops who see the ugliest, weirdest side of society. A daily inundation of kidnappers, child molesters and abusive and incestuous parents and grandparents is bound to take its toll, and that's really Maiwenn's concern here. The individual cases are of interest - they couldn't not be of interest, given the extreme and fraught nature of these issues. But the film's focus is mainly on the dynamics of the unit and on the impact the job has on the people who do it. At center stage are Karin Viard and Marina Fois, who play police partners Nadine and Iris. Nadine is going through the inevitable divorce, and Iris, who has a lot of personal authority, is coaching her to be tough and unbending in dealing with her husband. But beneath her facade of certainty, Iris is unraveling, too, and she has become anorexic.  Most Americans won't know this (though the effects will be obvious), but Polisse has a high-powered cast. Viard, barely known in the United States, is the French Meryl Streep, a grand-scale actress capable of anything, from broad comedy to tragedy. In Polisse, she gets to use a fair amount of her wide range. And Fois, who started off as a comedian, has become an important actress in just the last couple of years, known for her blunt, plainspoken style. Even the minor roles here are covered by major talent, with Emmanuelle Bercot (who co-wrote the script) playing one of the cops in the unit and Sandrine Kiberlain (Mademoiselle Chambon) memorable as a wife and mother who shows up at the police station, full of the weight of guilt and misery, to report her husband's sexual abuse of their daughter. Polisse is a well-observed study of human behavior in extreme conditions. The police attempt to block their emotions, but they can't, even when they think they can. They present a surface of imperviousness and long-suffering functionality to the criminals, but then make a mess of their own lives, or flare up and scream at each other. They are normal people doing a job, but they can't catch their breath long enough to return to normality. They're suffering from battle fatigue, and the battle never ends. Maiwenn, who appears in the film as a shy photographer documenting the unit, uses multiple cameras. She likes handheld footage. She likes to show people listening as well as talking, and she likes to have actors improvise, based on a script. The style is documentary-like, in that it feels like life and that anything might happen. There is also a nice sense of being in the midst of the action and right there in the room with the characters. ",1
"Drama. Starring Kevin Bishop, Paul Rhys and Juliet Stevenson. Directed by Ventura Pons. (Not rated. 105 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) Indeed, for all the naked buttocks and homoeroticism, Food of Love is fairly strong in its critique of a certain gay substratum within the arts. Pretty young Paul (Kevin Bishop) starts off idealistic and promising and, to be sure, ambitious. He ends up as lunch. The title, in that sense, is a play on words. According to Shakespeare, music may be the food of love, but in the movie, it's the kid who finds himself getting devoured. That, in itself, might not elevate Food of Love to distinction -- after all, in its outlines, it's just the boy version of a familiar story: Naive girl goes to the big city and soon finds herself getting used, and used up, by men. It's the extra layer that makes this one, the movie's understanding of how disillusion and inner compromise can gradually separate a young artist from his divine spark. Maybe Paul's spark wasn't bright enough to begin with. But who's to know? Directed by Ventura Pons, the picture features good performances from Bishop, as the green but hungry novice, and Paul Rhys, as Kennington, a great pianist whose engaging manner almost hides an infinite capacity for self-pity. Looking into the abyss of middle age, this aging boy wonder is finding his zest for life (as well as his looks) beginning to ebb. He needs a transfusion of vitality, rather like a vampire. The movie only falters in its depiction of Paul's mother, who is portrayed (by Juliet Stevenson) and written as a kind of fluttering grotesque. She is a parody of something, it seems, but it's not clear what. Obviously, she's the one character the filmmakers don't understand, but their insight into everyone else makes this flaw easy to overlook. -- This film contains strong language, nudity and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle Documentary. Directed by Chris Marker. (In English, French, German and Spanish, with English subtitles. Not rated. 180 minutes. At the Red Vic.) . Chris Marker's film -- more a video essay than a documentary -- examines the success of the left in the 1960s, then catalogs its failures in the early 1970s. This is the big picture of global protests and leftist, Marxist and radical movements -- a three-hour time capsule that features footage of the Black Panthers, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Salvador Allende and street protests that rocked capitals from Paris to Washington. .5 Amazingly, this 1978 movie (which Marker has reworked since then) was never released in the United States until this year. Its theatrical premiere in San Francisco should attract Bay Area moviegoers who are curious about how activists and revolutionaries in another era made headway in their quest to create (in their minds) a more utopian society. A Grin Without A Cat features some disturbing clips. The first minutes, in fact, show a U.S. pilot over Vietnam who is practically intoxicated about strafing and killing people in the fields below him. Right-wing protesters in Washington talk about repatriating Negroes back to Africa and yell Gas the Viet Cong! In Paris, secret police of the Shah of Iran use planks to club demonstrators. By contrast, Castro, Allende and others are seen as articulate spokespeople for change. Marker, an iconic filmmaker from France, doesn't give them complete carte blanche, though. He spends time asking why their revolutionary spirit didn't result in more widespread success (though he certainly casts blame on the United States for quashing Allende's 1973 election). The film ends on a positive note, with KPFA's Larry Bensky (in full '70s beard and glasses) and others saying, the struggle continues. Marker's film is a timely look back at civil disobedience, anti-war movements and the power of strong voices. - This film contains scenes of violence. -- Jonathan Curiel ",1
"Drama. Starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Melusine Mayance. Directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner. In English and in French with English subtitles. (PG-13. 111 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The demands of truth and the expectations of narrative film have long been at odds when it comes to Holocaust stories. Audiences want happy endings, and so the tendency of filmmakers has been to concentrate on Holocaust stories that contain at least some kind of uplift. But in the case of the Holocaust, to look on the bright side - even in a masterpiece like Schindler's List - is to miss the big picture. We won the war, but the Holocaust story is almost exclusively one of loss. Perhaps the passage of time is allowing for grimmer, more realistic treatments. Sarah's Key, set in modern times but with flashbacks to the war years, refuses to crank up the soundtrack and make audiences feel better. But it does provide audiences with the satisfaction of seeing and hearing an important truth expressed, and that's better than making you feel good. That's making you feel something.  Kristin Scott Thomas plays an American journalist working in France. (You already knew she could speak French, but who knew that she could speak American so fluently?) As the film opens, her family is moving into an apartment that has been in her husband's family for years, and based on the chronology, she realizes that it must have been previously inhabited by a French Jewish family evicted and deported during the notorious 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup. She starts digging and gradually uncovers the story of Sarah, a little girl who tried to hide her little brother from the French police. Sarah's saga and its impact across the generations become the focus of the movie.  Sarah's Key is a mature refutation of the romantic myth of wartime France as a land of partisans and Resistance fighters, and it's especially welcome to find this in a French film. The Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, in which Jews were placed in a sports stadium under unsanitary conditions, then separated from their families and sent to death camps, is a national disgrace, an atrocity committed by France against French citizens. The movie's stern message is all the more pointed in that the investigation is done by an American, not a French, journalist. As a woman consumed with the need for truth, even if it drives her into the ground, Thomas is brilliant as always, and in any language.",1
"Drama. Starring Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins and Billy Connolly. Directed by Dustin Hoffman. (PG-13. 98 minutes.) Quartet is the second of two movies to debut this month dealing with the subject of old age. Amour told the story of a woman in her mid-80s, experiencing a complete and permanent physical collapse. Quartet is about people about 10 years younger, who still feel pretty good, and want to be useful, but who can see the end in the near distance. Both films assert that older people are pretty much the same as younger people, except for failing bodies and different circumstances.  This sentiment is something we're going to hear more and more from movies, as Boomers and near Boomers age and start looking into the abyss: I am me. I look a little different, but I'm the same as I ever was. Quartet - directed by Dustin Hoffman and adapted by Ronald Harwood from his play - is a reminder from septuagenarian artists that turning 70 doesn't make anybody dumber or wiser. Most importantly, it doesn't make anybody less interesting. The setting is fascinating, a retirement home for old musicians, but serious musicians, not some guy who once played the tuba in a parade, but people who were in major orchestras or who sang opera at La Scala and Covent Garden - people who know what it's like to stand center stage and feel the cascade of applause. And now the applause has stopped. Careers of glamour and travel, with romantic flings fueled by room-service Champagne, are over. What is it like to be so full of talent that no one is interested in, and to have amazing stories that nobody really wants to hear? Hoffman, in his directorial debut, has crafted a hopeful movie with a warm atmosphere, but one that's realistic, too. There's a melancholy undertone, an unshakable awareness of death, not in the room, but down the hall and much too close. And the acting is glorious, which also has something to do with Hoffman, though he certainly made his life easier by casting wonderful actors. Quartet is buoyed by the Scottish charm of Billy Connolly, as a lovable flirt and extrovert - he is a delight and also a locus of truth in every scene he's in. Yet when the movie is over, the performance that will keep returning to mind may be that of Tom Courtenay, who plays a character of reserved disposition but enormous passion, someone whose intense loves and rages are mostly covered over with a gentle dignity. What can be said about the appeal of this character he plays? He just seems like a uniquely decent person. The precipitating event in Quartet is the arrival on the premises of a legendary diva, played by Maggie Smith - at this point my fingers are itching to type the great Maggie Smith, as though that were her full name. Smith has a special quality that no other actress possesses, an ability to suggest both clear-eyed perception and utter cluelessness simultaneously. It's an ideal note for a diva who knows the world and knows her own heart, and yet can be tin-eared in her dealings with people.  Wilf (Connolly), Reggie (Courtenay) and Jean (Smith) once appeared together in a now classic production of Rigoletto, along with Cissy (Pauline Collins), who also lives at the retirement home. Most of the film concerns the attempt to reunite the four singers for a charity event, an effort complicated by past history: Reggie and Jean were once married and broke up years before under bitter circumstances. As Cissy, Collins plays a woman of childlike enthusiasm and gentleness, who is in the early stages of dementia. Most of the time, she is mostly there, but sometimes less so. But one gets the sense that, with a little patience and a lot of love from her friends, Cissy's condition might stay in a holding pattern. In any case, Cissy's situation is treated as just another part of the old age terrain. Friends notice her problems, but no one is particularly fazed or distressed. That kind of detail marks this as the work of a screenwriter who knows the 70s experience through direct contact. Ronald Harwood - who has written lots of quality projects in recent years, including Being Julia, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and The Pianist - is 78. So he's familiar with the battle conditions.",1
"Drama. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams. Directed by David O. Russell. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Fighter is entertaining from beginning to end and contains two brilliant and extreme supporting performances that are among the year's best. The milieu, of working class Lowell, Mass., is re-created in rich detail, and Mark Wahlberg, as real-life welterweight Micky Ward, is an engaging locus of audience sympathy. No one will walk out of The Fighter thinking this is anything less than a quality project. Yet something fundamentally dishonest keeps it this side of brilliance, and, ironically, the dishonesty is a direct consequence of its telling a true story about real, living people. As presented here, Micky Ward is a battling bruiser in the ring, though, in his daily life, he's passive and at the mercy of his mother (Melissa Leo), who manages him, and his brother, Dicky (Christian Bale), who trains him. Both are pretty much useless. His mother doesn't have the business acumen to get him anywhere near the big time, and Dicky is a crack addict and consequently unreliable to say the least.  His mother and brother are sponges, living off Micky's pain and labor, and, what's worse, they're a united front. This is emphasized in Bale and Leo's performances, which were clearly worked out in concert to ape each other's facial expressions. They're a club of two. Thus, as much as they profess to be in Micky's corner, they're most loyal to each other.  Mom and Dicky are the true antagonists in opposition to our hero, not any boxer Micky might face in the ring. So it's appropriate that Leo and Bale should transform into outsized monsters completely unlike their usual screen selves. Leo loses her aura of earnestness and reserve and becomes an old sex-bomb harpy, in tight pants and low tops, a tough talking Mama who prides herself on holding her own in a man's world.  And not enough can be said for Bale, who lost 30 pounds for this role and looks like a bad day in hell - with a hollowed out face and bad teeth. He's a fidgety wreck, but fancies himself king of the neighborhood. Bale endows him with a confidence that has no justification in reality and that can only come from a lifetime spent as mother's favorite. His performance is shrewdly observed, physically precise and psychologically acute. It's beautiful work. The Fighter emerges, then, as a movie about the nightmare of family, how sometimes it's necessary to get away from one's relations in order to become an adult. In addition to Dicky, Micky has a swarm of sisters, all violent and stupid and presented by director David O. Russell as a comic chorus. In the whole film, only one person has Micky's back, and that's his girlfriend, Charlene, played by Amy Adams as just as hardboiled as Micky's family. She's lots of fun, though the role doesn't really give her a chance to play more than one note. Wahlberg, with his average-guy introspection and no-fuss consideration of other people, creates a character we can't help care about, and the question the audience has throughout is, Will he ever become a man and assert himself? The question is not Will he become a champ? because that's secondary. It's his manhood, not his standing in the world of boxing, that's on the line. Either he'll become an autonomous adult or he'll give into his family's dysfunction. Or perhaps something will happen in between. In any case, there's only one path here to a happy ending. This is precisely where the movie becomes dishonest. The screenplay, obviously, had to adhere to the basic facts - that's a precondition of telling a story from real life. But how the movie interprets those facts - as success or failure, victory or defeat, triumph or embarrassment - is the choice of the writers. Ultimately, The Fighter loses its courage and betrays the terms of its own story by fashioning an interpretation designed to please the people it portrays. It does a switch on us, by changing its focus from Micky's character to Micky's career and then pretending it was really about the career all along. Most people won't notice this and will walk out thinking, What a terrific picture. But if you do see the switch, you'll see nothing else, and it will mar your memory of an otherwise strong film. -- Advisory: This film contains drug use, nudity, strong language and sexual situations.",1
"Drama. Starring Mélanie Thierry, Lambert Wilson, Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet and Gaspard Ulliel. Directed by Bertrand Tavernier. In French with English subtitles. (PG-13. 139 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)  Bertrand Tavernier had made his share of swashbucklers (Revenge of the Musketeers), but from the opening scene of The Princess of Montpensier, it's clear that this time he's pursuing a less romantic vision of the past. He throws us right into France's 16th century religious war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and shows us a tawdry scene of carnage.  It's against this background that The Princess of Montpensier tells a fairly domestic story, albeit one involving high stakes and exalted people, major players in the ruling Catholic government. When we meet the pretty princess (Mélanie Thierry), her father has contracted her to marry one man, though she's in love with another, Henri de Guise (Gaspard Ulliel). Then her father changes his mind altogether and gives her to yet another man - to the prince of Montpensier (Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet).  Soon three men are in love with the princess: Henri, a soldierly brute who won't give up; the princely husband, who is young and worthy, though slightly awkward; and the Count de Chabannes, who works for the prince. He's a middle-aged former soldier, played by Lambert Wilson, an actor who for years played smooth lotharios, but who is now taking on an interesting, sorrowful quality. In Of Gods and Men, he played the head of the monastery. Here, he's the film's lone man of reason. The action revolves around the question of which course the princess will take. Will she recognize the worth of her husband? Will she submit to her own longing for de Guise, or return the love of Chabannes - or find herself in an intrigue with the silky-smooth Duke of Anjou (Raphaël Personnaz)? In a way, the backdrop of Catholic-Protestant war barely matters. This is, in a sense, a French relationship film about a woman of conflicting passions. It is all thoroughly entertaining and even, at times, gripping, because Tavernier gets us wondering what will happen next and worrying about the traps that threaten the princess at every turn. But the movie has a single weakness - the essential blankness of Thierry in the lead role. The men around the princess are impressive. The actors surrounding Thierry are equally impressive. But the princess just seems like a pretty girl, attractive but without much going on behind the eyes.  It's still a good movie by any measure, but that one slip in the casting prevents it from being fully realized.  -- Advisory: Contains nudity and violence.",1
"Drama. Starring Nadezhda Markina, Andrey Smirnov, Elena Lyadova and Aleksey Rozin. Directed by Andrei Zvyagintsev. In Russian with English subtitles. (Not rated. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's a sneaky thing about movies. Put the camera on anyone for a long enough period, and that person will automatically become the viewer's sympathetic focus. In Elena, director Andrei Zvyagintsev manipulates this tendency in an unusual way. Sedately and methodically, he leads the audience to a point of view that turns out to be the complete opposite of his own.  The director does this by purposely making us care about the wrong characters - as a way of showing us the sheer seductiveness of really bad thinking. I suspect many people will walk out of Elena having been entertained and yet asking themselves, But what was the point? They'll be confused because they will feel one thing, but think something else. Here's a tip: Don't feel. Think. Zvyagintsev wants you to come out of Elena thinking something, and if your realization is an uneasy one, that's OK with him. The title character is a woman in late middle age (Nadezhda Markina), a former nurse who jumped up a few rungs on the socio-economic ladder by marrying a fairly wealthy man (Andrey Smirnov). Elena has a son by a previous marriage, and he is the opposite of her husband - he's lazy, he drinks, he's unemployed, and he can't support his wife and kids. Elena helps out by lending him money, but as she doesn't control any of her husband's wealth, her ability to help is limited. Also in the picture is the husband's daughter by a previous marriage, Katya, the most arresting character in the film, in that we don't know quite what to make of her. Seen through Elena's eyes, Katya is a bad person - she's reckless and does drugs and is no better than Elena's waste of a son. Yet as played by Elena Lyadova (who has a movie star's poise), Katya's bitterness at least has the integrity of brutal honesty, and we get the hint - just a hint, we can't be sure - that this is a person of real quality.  So these are the personalities and the circumstances - nothing extraordinary, at least on the surface. But when an acute crisis intrudes, affecting all their lives, some remarkable events are set in motion. And the camera is there to record it, with a deadpan and impassive eye. There's no music to tell you what to think. It's just three good actors and one director's merciless powers of observation. ‌",1
"Drama. Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Imogen Poots, Christopher Walken and Mark Ivanir. Directed by Yaron Zilberman. (R. 105 minutes.) Four sedate, super-civilized musicians are thrown into a pressure cooker in A Late Quartet, a drama whose measured veneer gives way to memorable and explosive moments. There are movies that seduce major actors with the prospect of becoming an action figure, and then there are others that earn their world-class casts by providing scenes that remind actors why they became actors. A Late Quartet is the second kind of movie. There's a scene in which Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing a man who has had a spontaneous one-night stand with a woman, is in the process of nipping the affair in the bud. Suddenly his wife (Catherine Keener) walks up to their table, and the look on his face - the look of someone trying to seem like nothing is wrong - is so terrified that you feel physically transported into the actor's body: the heart pounding, the stomach clenching, the fast breathing, the panic.  That's amazing acting, and it's one of several extraordinary scenes for Hoffman, who is not the only one brilliant here. Director Yaron Zilberman, in his first narrative feature, has directed his actors to a series of staggering moments, some restrained and some bravura. Imogen Poots, as a daughter who feels that her mother betrayed her in childhood, has a brief outburst of rage and grief that knocks you back in your seat and takes the air out of the room. What power coming out of that young actress. Yet there are quieter moments just as pointed and just as effective, as when the senior member of the quartet (Christopher Walken) finds out in one of the movie's first scenes that he probably has Parkinson's disease. Walken lets you see it sink in and also lets you see to the extent that such a thing would not sink in, not all at once. Here's a musician whose whole livelihood, as well as his professional identity, is tied into his ability to move his fingers. The Parkinson's diagnosis is the catalytic event, and with that the lives of the four musicians, who are world renowned, begin to break out of confinement and become messy. Passions are let loose - the long-held resentments, the unrealized ambitions, as well as the question that always comes up among people who have done one thing very well for many years: Do I keep doing it, or would I be just as good at something new? In many ways, A Late Quartet is as civilized as its characters, which is not always an advantage. It's a movie about mature, rational people, which limits the possibilities - things can't get too crazy, after all. But for those willing to enter this world and pay attention, A Late Quartet provides distinct and uncommon satisfactions.",1
"Drama. Starring Pierce Brosnan, Michael Rea, Alan Bates and Julianna Margulies. Directed by Bruce Beresford. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) Pierce Brosnan plays Desmond, a working-class designer and laborer whose wife deserts him to run off to New Zealand. Because he's between jobs, the state intervenes and puts his kids (two sons and a daughter, Evelyn) into Catholic orphan asylums. Later, when he gets work, he finds that he can't secure the release of his kids, thanks to a statute that says that both parents have to petition for their release, and meanwhile Mom is nowhere to be found. Thus begins a legal odyssey that brings in a team of three lawyers to Desmond's aid, played by Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea and Alan Bates (who fusses around stealing every scene). Along the way, Desmond keeps going to the pub and getting drunk. Even as played by Brosnan and presented as the movie's hero, Dad does not come across as a prepossessing fellow, and we can't help but wonder what the real Desmond was like. The boys' home is never shown, but the movie spends a lot of time in Evelyn's orphanage, which seems realistic in that it's not depicted as a chamber of horrors but rather as a lonely place. There's the inevitable sadistic nun, but there are nice nuns, too, which, as anyone who went to Catholic school can attest, is the usual proportion. One sadist per facility seems to be the limit. The victory of director Bruce Beresford and his cast is that by the end he makes the audience care about the characters and the verdict. But it seems only a concession to convention that this slight story was stretched to full length. It probably could have best been told in about an hour. . This film contains scenes of corporal punishment. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel. Directed by Diane Kurys. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Children of the Century is a historical romance about the grand and tortured love affair between novelist George Sand and the poet Alfred de Musset in 19th century France. Such love affairs in costume dramas are always grand and tortured, if only because the costumes themselves are grand and it's torture trying to take them off in a hurry. But Sand and de Musset's affair was more grand and tortured than most, and it left a legacy of conflicting memoirs, novels and poems. The film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of Juliette Binoche as Sand, who brings to the role her pale, dark beauty and characteristic warmth -- a warmth that always has just a hint of recklessness underneath it. In Children of the Century, the longings of Sand's reckless heart are answered by her immediate attraction to Musset (Benoit Magimel), a younger man with a reputation for brilliance, dissipation and emotional cruelty. Movies about the romances of literary giants constitute a kind of genre unto themselves, and although there's no denying their fascination, it's hard to be sure what exactly makes them so enjoyable: Is it that the feelings cut deeper when the participants are masters of expressing feeling? Or is it the other way, that it's amusing to see the pedestrian sources of great art -- and to see the artists themselves getting tripped up on the usual love stuff that screws up everybody else? In Children of the Century, writer-director Diane Kurys, with the unflinching attention to romantic misery that we associate with French cinema, shows how Sand and Musset's affair began to collapse while on vacation to Venice. (Traveling can be a strain.) She gets sick, and instead of caring for her, he goes to brothels and gambling dens. At this point, we know he's bad news. But it takes Sand 70 more minutes or so of screen time to figure it out, and even then we can't be sure she gets it. Director Kurys is herself rather forgiving of Musset, seeing something gallant in the young man's hunger for destruction. All we see is a handsome fellow, albeit one who, as played by Magimel, has enough charm to keep us watching. - This film contains nudity, sexual situations and harsh language. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Drama. Starring Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and Mark Strong. Directed by Ridley Scott. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Russell Crowe is a different kind of Robin Hood, and Ridley's Scott's Robin Hood is a very different distillation of the old legend. Crowe isn't merry. He's not impish, and he has no green suit. He doesn't put his hands on his waist and throw back his head laughing, and he doesn't even steal from the rich to give to the poor. Rather, he fights against the rich to protect the rights of the upper middle class. And the battles are ugly - arrows through the neck, spears through the chest, very medieval.What Crowe brings to the role is the natural aura of a leader, as well as the decent-guy integrity of a man who means what he says. One of Crowe's best moments comes early. King Richard the Lionheart, who is so morally compromised that he's played by Danny Huston, asks for Robin's honest opinion of his Holy Land Crusade. Ruefully, quietly and steadily, Robin/Crowe tells a shameful story of mass slaughter, and the moral weight of the atrocity lands on everyone, onscreen and in the audience. Through such moments, Scott's approach to the legend becomes persuasive. Instead of the usual romantic adventure, Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland offer a gritty drama, using the Robin Hood story to depict the birth pangs of liberty. They ground the film in the details of medieval life. We see how wars were fought - the various strategies and weaponry - and how news traveled. We see the attempts at pomp and splendor, the church bells and trumpets greeting the arrival of the king. Mainly we see harshness and ugliness. The common people are stupid, and the wealthy are evil schemers, and even the good guys smell to high heaven. In this scheme, Crowe becomes essential: He is utterly believable as the unconscious standard-bearer of the future, the select man through whom humanity might make some small, desperately needed advance.He starts off as a common archer, returning from King Richard's disastrous last crusade. Richard is no hero. He and his men are raping the countryside, sacking every castle and estate on their way back to England. Robin and a group of friends escape Richard's ranks, but they soon find themselves drawn into the center of a series of intrigues involving the future of England. In most Robin Hood movies, the political situation is drawn in such a way that it's easy to know when to hiss and when to cheer. But in Robin Hood, the politics are intentionally muddled. In a struggle between the vindictive, mincing Prince John (Oscar Isaac) and the French invaders, there really is no one to root for, as neither represents the people's interests. This is a sophisticated approach to the material, but it presents some narrative challenges, too, and the movie slows down and starts to sag about two-thirds in. It recovers. Scott has great command of his action sequences. His cutting and camera movements are vigorous but not haphazard, and the hand-to-hand combat is processed in such a way that everything metallic (swords, belt buckles, etc.) looks electric. More significantly, we never lose the overall picture. One battle looks like a 13th century version of the Normandy invasion, with just a touch of the Bay of Pigs. If the movie lacks something, it's on the emotional side of things. A dour Robin could have used a lively Maid Marion to give him something to fight for, but the relationship between Marion (Cate Blanchett) and Robin is lukewarm, as though they're saving the fireworks for a sequel that may never happen. This is the downside to Scott's decidedly unromantic take on the legend. He removed the adventure aspect, and some of the movie's passion was lost, too, like a dolphin caught in a tuna net.Perhaps it's for that reason that a movie that starts out with the potential to be great somehow falls short, and what seems as if it's going to be a revelation ends up, instead, simply a worthwhile, reasonably interesting variation on an old theme. -- Advisory: Lots of violence and bad teeth.",1
"Drama. Starring Sam Riley, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Stewart and Kirsten Dunst. Directed by Walter Salles. (R. 124 minutes.) The Walter Salles film On the Road is something of a sprawling mess, but then so is the novel. That was really the choice, to do Jack Kerouac's book and end up with something rich but ragged, or not do the book and end up with something not worth doing at all. This time, a filmmaker decided to do the former, and the result is a movie that, like the book, is episodic and has dips in energy but has more than its share of glory and illumination. One of the great things the film does is capture the sense of actually being on the road, the relentless curving line of highway as seen through a windshield, the scenery rushing by on both sides. You get the bigness of the country and the freedom once available to people in those pre-cell phone days when you could still get away. You also get a sense of the era, and of the specialness of these Beat progenitors who, in ways better and worse, were a full 20 years ahead of their time. These people were getting stoned and having casual affairs when the rest of the country was watching the Milton Berle show. They were listening to complicated jazz when The Tennessee Waltz was topping the charts. To escape convention so thoroughly is a rare thing, and though the Beat life gradually begins to look exhausting and ugly, it's hard not to see the conventional world through their eyes, as populated by zombies. The screenplay, by Jose Rivera, comes from three main sources. The principal one is Kerouac's original novel, published in 1957. The second is the unedited draft of On the Road - Kerouac's original scroll - which was published decades later. And the third source is the true history of Kerouac, Neal Cassady and LuAnne Henderson, the prototypes of Sal Paradise, Dean Moriarty and Marylou, respectively. In some places, the truth was even more extreme than anything Kerouac set down.  It begins in New York, where Dean (Garrett Hedlund) works parking cars - he's a genius behind the wheel - and Sal (Sam Riley) is trying to be a writer. In Dean, Sal finds his subject. In a circle in which everyone is trying to be free, inspired and spontaneous, Dean is all those things naturally. He's an occasional car thief, a former prostitute and a man that even intelligent women seem to love on sight. Apparently, Neal Cassady was all those things in real life, though in the footage we have of him (taken years later) he seems like a bug-eyed motormouth. Rather than imitate the real Cassady, Hedlund takes the wiser course of making Dean's allure plausible. So in On the Road, we get a Dean Moriarty who is mercurial, yet cool. Soon, the men are taking off on the road - one of many trips - in which they are sometimes joined by Marylou, Dean's teenage bride. Marylou is a womanly kid, oblivious yet observant, celebrated yet victimized, and Stewart's casting in the role was no concession to box office. She has never been better. Camille (Kirsten Dunst), the other important woman in Dean's life, is Marylou's opposite - smarter, older, more self-respecting. But for all her intelligence and experience, she ends up no happier than Marylou. Like the Romantic poets, the Beats led lives of bohemian glamour and freedom, but also like those Romantic poets, their freedom was made possible by the misery of their women, who were used and abandoned - in San Francisco, in Camille's case, and who raised their children while they snorted Benzedrine and patted each other on the back. The brief but vivid appearance of Amy Adams as Jane, based on Joan Vollmer, the second wife of William S. Burroughs (Viggo Mortensen), emphasizes that message without words. A few years after the events of On the Road, Burroughs would kill Vollmer in a drunken game of William Tell. It's part of the movie's honesty that what looks so fresh at the beginning of On the Road starts to look so tired and old by the end. That's not a fault of the movie. That's the point of it. As Carlo Marx - that is Allen Ginsberg - actor Tom Sturridge raves about embracing life, but soon you come to realize that everything coming out of his mouth is pretension and pompous idiocy, some new and amazing form of nonsense, as empty as the void.  Chalk it up to the price of winning the culture war. Your own lies are laid bare, and you become the cliche. ",1
"Drama. Starring Samantha Morton and Kathleen McDermott. Directed by Lynne Ramsay. (Not rated. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Thus begins this strange, moody film that could easily have seemed like a willful wallow in the macabre but for the odd truth of Morton's performance and the psychologically penetrating direction of Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher). Morvern is an arresting figure, seemingly a cipher but with an instinct and an appetite for life that's both admirable and alarming. Ramsay tells Morvern's story as through a perspective not unlike Morvern's consciousness: slow and rather dazed, yet relentless. Presented finally with an opportunity to have fun, Morvern lets her boyfriend's body rot in the apartment and goes on holiday to Spain with the funeral money he's left, bringing along her best friend, Lanna (Kathleen McDermott). The Spanish resort is a tacky dump where young tourists stream toilet paper from their balconies. The audacious notion presented by the movie (and presumably by the Alan Warner novel on which it's based) is that somehow Morvern can see its tackiness, as though recent events have suddenly made her into someone with a view beyond the fleshly realm. Thus Morvern's break with Lanna, who inhabits nothing but the world of drinking and boys, becomes inevitable. Morton has moments of striking subtlety and detail. Her take upon receiving a major offer for her boyfriend's novel (which she claims as her own) is as satisfying a close-up as anyone could hope to see. If the movie has a major weakness, it's that those Scottish accents -- particular McDermott's -- can be really hard for an American ear to comprehend. -- This film contains nudity, blood, sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Benno Furmann, Nina Hoss, Alexandra Maria Lara and Mehmet Kurtulus. Directed by Doris Dorrie. (Not rated. 98 minutes. In German with English subtitles. At the Rafael.) . Naked is a touchy-feely-talkie German film about six friendships and three romantic relationships, all in various stages of decay. The movie has the integrity of sincerity and is buoyed by passionate performances and genuine insights, even if the endless prattle can sometimes become wearing and the movie's central gimmick -- though titillating -- is a little far-fetched and contrived. The movie gets its title from that gimmick. Three 30ish couples are sitting at a dinner party, and one suggests that if two of the couples were to take off their clothes and put on blindfolds, none of the partners would be able to recognize his or her beloved's body just by touch. (No face touching or hair touching allowed.) The couples jump at the opportunity to prove themselves and to touch and be touched. It's hard to see what the experiment is designed to prove, and anyway it's absurd: Of course the partners would recognize each other. Still, what better way to liven up a dull dinner party, or inject some life into a movie? Aside from the party, the movie is arranged as a series of two-person scenes in which characters delve into their relationships. Emilia and Felix, who are broken up, talk about what went wrong (everything). The nouveaux riches Charlotte and Dylan, who are resented for their money, talk about what's going wrong (everything). And Annette and Boris, who are about to become engaged, talk about what might go wrong (these two have hope). It's in the nature of movies about relationships to show that relationships are hard work but worth salvaging. Naked, which opens today at the Rafael and moves to the Roxie Cinema in February, does the same, but Dorrie shows us enough to make it clear that two of these couples don't belong together and ought to cut their losses. It's hard to say if that's the filmmaker's intention, but the film's honesty is its saving grace. . This film contains full frontal nudity and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy. Directed by Steve Guttenberg. (R. 92 minutes. At the Opera Plaza and Shattuck in Berkeley.) . Back in 1975, when James Kirkwood wrote the off-Broadway play P.S. Your Cat Is Dead, gay men weren't part of the American mainstream. Homosexuality was still exotic, shrouded in mystery, and the emergence of gay politicians, gay sitcoms and gay sports figures was unthinkable. It's another world now, which is why Kirkwood's play, adapted to the screen by actor Steve Guttenberg, feels so moldy and out of date. Directed by Guttenberg, who co-wrote the screenplay and also stars, P.S. has been moved to the present but creates its own time warp by showing a world in which straights and gays are instant antagonists with built-in suspicion of the other. Guttenberg, a once-popular actor (Three Men and a Baby) at low ebb, plays Jimmy Zoole, a failed actor-novelist who's having the worst day of his life. His girlfriend dumped him, his recent One Man Hamlet bombed and his beloved cat has just died. When a crafty burglar (Lombardo Boyar) breaks into his apartment, Jimmy knocks him out and hog-ties him to the kitchen sink instead of calling the police. In the '70s, when Sal Mineo played the burglar in New York and San Francisco, there was a freshness and edge to this concept. Today, this highly charged test of wills feels silly and insulting: Gay burglar taunts straight writer with sexual come-ons, writer punishes burglar by feeding him cat food. It's tough to generate sympathy for Guttenberg's character and his juvenile case of homosexual panic. He whines, he throws garbage at his girlfriend, and when she returns to the apartment and finds a bare-bottomed burglar tied to the sink -- thereby assuming that her ex has suddenly turned queer -- Guttenberg cackles madly, as if turning gay were a spurned lover's best revenge. Guttenberg's view of sexual identity is so confused that one character comes off like a bizarre grafting of gay and straight cliches: part macho homophobe, part badly dressed nelly boy. . This film contains raw language and partial nudity. -- Edward Guthmann Comedy-drama. Starring Ge You, Rosamund Kwan and Donald Sutherland. Directed by Feng Xiaogang. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At the Galaxy.) . Big Shot's Funeral is of mild interest as a curiosity, but not as entertainment. It's a mainland Chinese film starring Donald Sutherland, Hong Kong actress Rosamund Kwan and mainland actor Ge You, in what seems to be a satire of the advertising world. By American standards, the satire is about 50 years behind the times, but even accounting for cultural differences, the comedy is limp and the storytelling so inept as to provoke amazement. Sutherland plays an American director in Beijing filming a remake of The Last Emperor when he suddenly finds himself in a state of creative paralysis. Soon he suffers a life-threatening physical breakdown. Before collapsing, he tells a Chinese cameraman that he wants a comedy funeral, and the rest of the movie involves said cameraman (Ge You) arranging for the funeral, while the director clings to life in a hospital. From this side of the world, it's hard to say if the film is meant as a satire of American media values or of an encroaching capitalist mentality within communist Chinese society. In any case, the scenes that are expected to have 'em rolling in the aisles involve, for example, the organizers booking TV time and selling ad space on the side of the hearse. Sutherland seems to be enjoying himself, as if slumming, and has a couple of nice moments at the start of the movie, funny and on the edge of tears when he can't seem to get an idea. But for the rest of the movie he and Kwan, as his assistant, are reduced to exposition or, even worse, commentary. They have conversations that tell us how we should feel about the funeral preparations. Director Feng Xiaogang has someone observe that the director and the cameraman, despite the language barrier, have developed a deep bond. We don't see the bond develop. We're just told that it exists and are asked to take it on faith. Likewise we're told that Lucy (Kwan) has fallen in love with the cameraman. Really, we'd have never guessed. . This film contains some strong language, in subtitle. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Drama. Starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Kevin Kline and Jennifer Beals. Directed by Caroline Bottaro. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The debut film from director Caroline Bottaro, who wrote the beautiful C'est la vie, stars Sandrine Bonnaire as a working-class woman who discovers a latent ability for chess. Working as a hotel maid, she sees a glamorous American couple playing on a terrace, and somehow chess becomes infused in her mind with romance and feminine power. This interest works a gradual transformation in the woman, who starts staying up nights teaching herself the game's strategies. She gets lessons from a crusty American man - Kevin Kline in his first French-language performance - and the subtleties of their interaction are handled perfectly. We are aware of barely perceptible shifts in power and vaguely hinted at expressions of romantic interest. It's almost necessary to see it twice to really appreciate fully what's going on between Kline and Bonnaire's characters over the course of the film. Bonnaire, who was born working-class, knows this woman inside out - the personal dignity, the suppressed anger, the frustration of often feeling powerless - and she knows better than to romanticize being broke. This woman is looking for a lifeline, and chess is her way to power. Bottaro finds ways to dramatize chess, and the environments are fascinating throughout. The movie takes place in Corsica, a big rock with people on it.  Jennifer Beals plays the glamorous American woman at the start of the film, and Bottaro has suggested that Beals should be seen as Beals, that this is the actress playing herself. It does work better that way. -- Advisory: Sexual situations and strong language.",1
"Drama. Starring Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning. Directed by Sofia Coppola. (R. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The question about Somewhere is whether anyone will like it for the right reasons. That is, for pure reasons, for how it was intended. Or will they enjoy it for the way it allows them to press their noses to the glass and see how the other ... not half, but privileged sliver-of-a-percentage ... lives?  For 15 minutes, this new film from Sofia Coppola is blase and deadpan, slightly precious and not particularly interesting. The movie follows a scruffy fellow played by Stephen Dorff as he goes about his life. He tests a sports car. (Coppola shows us lap after lap after lap). He watches twins do pole dances in his hotel room. (Coppola gives us two whole pole dances.) Whenever he steps outside, women smile at him, even though he looks like an unshaven slob. One wonders why, and then the reason is revealed. He's a movie star. As in a big one, like bigger than Stephen Dorff. More like Brad Pitt, when he was single. With that revelation, Somewhere suddenly becomes riveting. But do we actually care about this man? Do we feel sorry for him when he calls his ex-wife weeping about how he's nothing and not even a person? Maybe we do, if the we in this case includes other movie stars and people who travel in that world. But I suspect most other people will think, gee, too bad, huh? What a hard life, poor baby, having to talk to the press and have sex with lots of women and accept all those awards and all. It must be a living hell. This is a winning formula for Coppola, all the more winning because it's arrived at sincerely: First she shows us people who are enormously well off. Then she assures us, lest we begin to resent them and, by extension, her, that every one of these people is absolutely miserable. What's more, she gives us enough specifics, in terms of manners, mores and functional details, that we completely understand why they easily could be miserable. After all, it gets stuffy in those hotel rooms, and it's a little irritating having everybody laugh at your jokes when you're not funny or jump into bed with you just so they can gossip about it later. There are worse and more dignified ways of being unhappy, of course, but in a way that's part of the misery, too. That's part of feeling like you're not even a person.  Elle Fanning plays the star's 11-year-old daughter, another child of privilege in the Coppola oeuvre (like Marie Antoinette) and another witness to the inside world of celebrity (like Scarlett Johansson in Lost in Translation). Forced by circumstances to stay with him for a few weeks, she lives in the various hotels playing high-end video games, travels with him to Milan to promote a film, and wakes up to have breakfast with his latest one-night stand. She stares daggers at her father across the table. The emotion in Somewhere is diffused, as if the characters are feeling things but not completely, not as other people feel them. There's a disconnect or a distance that perhaps comes from overstimulation. To have access to everything means to feel less, and to have so many people in one's life and so much distraction and so many temptations of the ego and the flesh is to find oneself on the outside of normal things, like family. Personal relationships just doesn't mean as much, even if you want them to, or need them to. Indeed, it could be a disservice to Coppola to believe that she wants us to care about this father and daughter and we don't. Coppola's ambitions may not be so conventional. I suspect her real intention, and what she reinforces stylistically (and what she could never admit on a talk show, or else people will get mad at her) is for us to watch this relationship from a cool distance and observe where it's real and where it's distorted, to see it as a modern-day curiosity with some residual human elements. Whatever the intention, Somewhere, in its odd, detached way, is compelling viewing. By the way, did you know that, if you're a big shot, and you check out of a hotel, you don't have to pack your bags? You don't even have to have an assistant pack your bags. The hotel will do it for you and store your stuff until you come back. Impressive. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, nudity, drug use and strong language.",1
"Drama. Starring Thomas Doret, Cécile De France and Jérémie Renier. Directed by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)No one makes movies like the Dardennes, Jean-Pierre and Luc, the Belgian filmmaking brothers who combine a deadpan documentary style with vision that's astonishingly humane, empathetic and full of feeling. This is an odd combination, and what it means in practice is that, with a Dardennes movie, nothing much seems to be going on - until everything seems to be going on. We watch events at a remove, and then, at a certain magical point, we are in the story, and we don't quite know how they did it - again.The Dardennes gravitate to society's fringes, and so in The Kid With a Bike, we get the story of a boy who has been dumped by both parents and is living in a home. At the start of the movie, he is absolutely frantic to find the bike that his father promised him. He's practically feral, and at first the prospect of an hour and a half in this kid's company is not too promising. But without diminishing the boy's intensity or making him in any way ingratiating, the Dardennes take us into his mind, and we begin to appreciate not only his predicament but his resiliency. We start seeing, in the very things that make him a nuisance, the personality traits that may ensure his survival. The film co-stars the Belgian actress Cécile De France (Hereafter) as a hairdresser who becomes the boy's foster mother, a down-to-earth, no-fuss embodiment of goodness. She's perfect, and I also love the way the Dardennes directed the kid - or maybe they just cast him to type, and brilliantly. If you see the movie, pay attention to the last shot, which is nothing fancy, and yet tells you everything you need to know about what will happen to this kid today, tomorrow and 20 years from now.  These Dardennes are very, very good at what they do.",1
"Drama. Starring Vincent Gallo, Alden Ehrenreich and Maribel Verdú. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. (R. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A few years ago, Francis Ford Coppola rebooted his creativity by giving himself permission to be a novice again. He shook off the burden of having to build on a legend and instead resolved to make small, independently financed, personal movies. Youth Without Youth (2007), the first product of that decision, may have been ponderous and a bit self-important, but it had enough sterling moments to indicate something fruitful and promising in this new direction. That promise is fulfilled with Tetro, which finds Coppola comfortable in this new, emerging style - pulling from skills developed over a long career, but bringing those abilities into a new configuration. The film is not perfect. It may be too sincere to be perfect, and Coppola, who wrote the screenplay, gets into some script trouble in the last half hour. Still, the movie is alive from beginning to end, and it's a pleasure to see at least one big-name director get out of the prison of his own reputation. So many others - you could make a list - would benefit from doing the same. Shot mostly in black-and-white, Tetro could easily be the most beautiful looking movie you'll see all year. The sharp, high contrast cinematography - shot with digital cameras - calls to mind images of New Orleans in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). But as always in movies, beauty isn't simply a matter of arranging a series of static pretty pictures. The camera placement in Tetro is intuitively right and psychologically rich, so that the audience is always receiving information, consciously and unconsciously.  Some sequences would reward a shot-by-shot analysis, for example an early scene, in which young Bennie (Alden Ehrenreich), who works on a cruise ship, seeks out his brother one night in a Buenos Aires flat. The brother's live-in girlfriend, Miranda (Maribel Verdú), answers the door, and something in the introduction of these characters makes a viewer want to linger in this world. Vincent Gallo completes the trio as Bennie's older brother, Tetro, a sensitive but frustrated and angry man, who wants nothing to do with his family or his past. Tetro deals with the collateral damage of having a father who is an artist of international stature, in this case an orchestra conductor (played in a handful of vivid flashbacks by Klaus Maria Brandauer). Both brothers are running from the father's lovelessness and ego. Both brothers would like to be artists in their own right, though the price of art may be more than either is willing to pay. And both are savoring life away from the fray, living outside of time in this foreign city and within the warm, accepting glow of Miranda. That glow, Verdú's contribution to Tetro, is essential to the other characters and to the film's whole feeling.  In Tetro, Coppola puts out a lot of ideas and story threads about art, ambition and the bonds of family. He tries to resolve it all in the last half hour, but his story apparatus is ungainly. Instead of everything coming together at once, those ships come in separately. Coppola tries to overcome this extenuated feeling by raising the emotional pitch and keeping it there, but something in the finish, though satisfying, feels awkward.  Awkward, but full of life. Awkward, but impassioned - like something written by a young person. Let's look at Tetro as the new Coppola's second film and greet this as the first major work of a promising young filmmaker.  -- Advisory: This film contains nudity, strong language and sexual situations.",1
"Drama. Starring Will Ferrell, Rebecca Hall and Laura Dern. Directed by Dan Rush. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Everything Must Go, we find Will Ferrell in his first dramatic role, and he has just enough going on that we can welcome this change of pace as the beginning of something interesting.  Ferrell has a good look for drama, in that he's a type common in life but not often seen in movies - a big guy who looks weaker for being big, whose power seems diffused over space, like one of those vegetable-eating dinosaurs that get devoured by velociraptors. When he keeps a straight face, he no longer looks above it all but disconnected from all the smaller, busier people who are running things, and who are about to run right over him. The demolition starts from the opening sequence, in which Ferrell, as a business executive, gets fired from his longtime job for being an alcoholic - but probably also for being middle-aged and commanding a big salary. So he goes home, and that's when he discovers that his wife is gone, the locks have been changed, and everything he owns is on his front lawn, including his lounge chair. He sits down on it and resolves not to budge.  And that's about what we see in Everything Must Go, a man sitting on a couch, sometimes drinking, sometimes white-knuckling it. He talks to the young married woman (Rebecca Hall) across the street, who has her own thinly concealed sorrows. He makes friends with a neighborhood kid who helps him organize a yard sale. And he thinks and tries not to think about how he ended up addicted and burnt out in middle age. This is a difficult role. With little external action, the drama has to take place inside the character. This leaves Ferrell with enormous spaces to fill, and he can't quite fill them. He lacks, and has always lacked, a tragic consciousness. Robin Williams has one - it has been well used and ill used, but he has it. Chaplin had it. In their own weird way, Jerry Lewis and Jim Carrey have it. But Ferrell has never seemed fundamentally screwed up, and so we don't receive this drama as a chance to look into him with fascination. He can't give us a labyrinth of pain and turbulence, just a regular guy in trouble.  Everything Must Go is based on a Raymond Carver short story (Why Don't You Dance), and at times feels like something short that has been stretched beyond its natural limits. There are too many somber interludes with nothing going on but an acoustic guitar echoing over the soundtrack, the spareness of the score suggesting the emptiness of the characters' lives.  Yet, though Ferrell may not be the most arresting consciousness to showcase, he is, throughout, a sympathetic focus for a movie that is really about something that all Americans either know or fear or try to push away, which is failure. Things happen. Sometimes people end up back at square one, and it's not their fault. Sometimes it is their fault, but that's no less painful. There are complications, disappointments. The bottom falls out, and people land in the middle of their lives with nothing around but bleached-out bones and tumbleweeds.  This is where Ferrell's average-guy look comes in handy. Everything Must Go is supposed to be about one person, but in a bad economy, an audience's capacity for empathy becomes a beautiful thing. Everything can go. Sometimes it does go. The movie tells a pertinent story about what happens next. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and sexual content.",1
"Drama. Starring Yvan Attal and Anne Consigny. Directed by Lucas Belvaux. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Set in modern times but loosely based on a real-life 1978 kidnapping, Rapt is the story of a wealthy businessman with international ties and powerful political influence whose life changes forever when he is abducted on a Paris street. Gagged, drugged, thrown into the trunk of a car, forced to live in a tent, forced to live in a dungeon, given little food, he goes from being the most enviable to the most pitiable of creatures. The film stars Yvan Attal, who plays the businessman as a master of efficiency, a borderline impassive character so desensitized by wealth that he needs excessive stimulus in order to feel any contact or connection. So in the early, pre-abduction scenes, we see him gambling away major chunks of his fortune in weekly card games and visiting his mistress for some fast intimacy on the way to a finance meeting. Even before his world starts caving in, he is odd, and we're left to wonder if he's odd because of who he is - or if he is who he is because he's odd and therefore suited to this life.  As thrillers go, Rapt is long on intellect and short on action, a virtue to some degree, though not entirely. Most of the film alternates between scenes of the businessman's life in captivity, as he gets thinner and hairier and develops an anxious look in his eyes, reminiscent of Buster Keaton, though without being funny. These are followed by scenes of the outside world - the police, his colleagues and his wife (Anne Consigny) struggling to come up with the ransom.  What distinguishes Rapt from other kidnapping movies is that, virtually as soon as he is abducted, details of his life start coming out. This is a typically French formulation: It's not about the action but the interaction. What happens in a wife's mind when the husband she worries about is revealed to have blown most of his fortune, and to have a separate apartment for assignations, and to have a mistress on the payroll and a long history of other women? Furthermore, what happens to a man's chances of being ransomed when his character is being annihilated in the press? This is an interesting approach, and an entertaining one, and the animal-like, watchful performance by Attal is a standout. But one does leave the Rapt with a sense of something unresolved, that perhaps it needed about 20 minutes of internal cuts followed by some additions to the ending, so as to bring the movie to a clearer resolution. A planned American remake (directed by the Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier) has a chance to bring some improvements, so long as it doesn't wreck everything good about the original.",1
"Dreamgirls: Musical. Starring Beyoncé Knowles, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson. Directed by Bill Condon. (PG-13. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle on 'Happyness,' 'Dreamgirls.']Indeed, without Hudson's magic, without that extra feeling that comes from seeing the launch of something extraordinary, Dreamgirls might have been a break-even affair. The film has strong roles, good actors and a compelling story that takes place over the course of 10 or 15 years. But it has, with only a couple of exceptions, a pedestrian score that sounds like generic show-music schlock and lyrics that are not distinctive. A film adaptation of the long-running Broadway show, Dreamgirls tells the story of a Motown-like singing group, known as the Dreams, who serve as an alternative-universe version of the Supremes. Like the Supremes, the Dreams start off with a belter as the lead singer -- in this case it's Effie, played by Hudson -- but for commercial considerations, the manager makes a switch. He takes the prettier girl, Deena (Knowles), and brings her out front, pushing Effie into the background. Though in the lives of the characters the film seems to cover about a decade, the film spans a roughly 15-year period in pop music history, from the girl-group days of the early '60s to disco's zenith, circa 1979. This is a rich period, full of stylistic and cultural changes that are reflected in the look and manner of the characters, and the panorama makes for a satisfying mixture of real life and fantasy. With Dreamgirls we get an irresistible soap opera of success, in all its public glamour and private squalor, enhanced further by the perennial allure of the inside story. The songs just have to be overlooked: They don't sound like Motown, nor do they approach them in quality. In fact, in the glitzy talent-show scene that starts the film, it's difficult to tell whether the songs are supposed to be bad or are just that way by accident. Foxx radiates the cool confidence of a pop visionary as manager-turned-mogul Curtis Taylor Jr., a character meant to evoke Berry Gordy Jr., the founder of Motown Records. Taylor has the lucrative but lonely gift of always knowing what the public wants, which means constantly being in the position of giving his friends bad news. It's a nice touch in the script that, even when his people skills deteriorate, he remains consistently right in his commercial instincts. For his first trick, he makes a mainstream success of a small-time rock 'n' oller named James Thunder Early, played by Murphy with uncontainable gusto. Murphy's pleasure in the role is contagious. James Early's stage antics call to mind Little Richard and James Brown at their most extravagant, and it helps that Murphy, unlike Foxx, can sing. In the case of Foxx, there's an unintentionally funny moment about two-thirds into the picture, when it looks as if he's about to sing. Instead, the movie goes into a fade-out, and the audience breathes a sigh of relief. Have I said enough about other people yet? Can I talk about Hudson now? Her number, And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going constitutes one of the most exhilarating scenes in this year's cinema. It's the best number in the score, and with her powerful voice she sings that song up, down and sideways. But equally and perhaps even more impressively is the fullness of feeling with which she acts it. About midway through, the magnificence of what Hudson is doing up there becomes manifest, and from then on it's actually thrilling to watch her. It's thrilling in two distinct ways simultaneously. It's thrilling as a moment in a movie, in the Everything's Coming Up Roses way of someone standing there and tearing down the house. But it's also thrilling as a moment in the life of a young woman, Hudson herself. Given this opportunity that so few people ever get -- the opportunity to show everything she can do, on a stage as big as the earth -- she brings it all home flawlessly and gloriously. A handful of times in your life, you might get to see something like this on the live stage. But movies rarely lend themselves to this sort of moment. Beyoncé's pretty good, too. You don't want to sing in the same movie as Hudson, but she has a voice, and her performance as a modest and easily manipulated young woman, who remains diffident despite the adulation of stardom, has some moving moments. Yet the mind keeps returning to Hudson. Here's one last thing: I've been going to the movies a long time. This is the first time I ever saw people sit during the closing credits, just so they could cheer when a performer's name came up. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and drug use. ",1
"Dreamland: Drama. Starring Agnes Bruckner, Kelli Garner, Justin Long and John Corbett. Directed by Jason Matzner. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle discusses Nativity Story, Turistas and Dreamland.]They're best friends and live in a trailer park, Audrey (Bruckner) with her mournful, drunken father (John Corbett) and Calista (Garner) with her heavily tattooed mother. Audrey is shrewd and perceptive, a poet lurking under a shell of cynicism, while Calista is sweet, spacey and effusive. Audrey has the intelligence and the ability to go far in life, while Calista's dreams have been complicated by a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. She'd like to be Miss America, and her wholesome good looks make that almost seem possible. When a nice guy (Justin Long) their age moves into the community, Audrey is immediately attracted to him, but she does something odd. Conditioned to take care of everybody -- her father, her friend -- she impulsively fixes the boy up with Calista, even though he seems more attracted to Audrey. When a romance between the boy and Calista takes hold, Audrey finds herself pining away, unprepared for the raw pain of longing. Dreamland shakes down as a love triangle in which all the parties are complex and sympathetic. Frankly, I couldn't understand why this young fellow couldn't be completely in love with Calista -- she's exquisitely pretty and sweet -- but then Audrey is worthy, too, as well as emotionally dignified and capable. The story mainly follows Audrey, and her dilemma is powerfully conveyed by Bruckner, director Jason Matzner and writer Tom Willett: She knows she should leave the trailer park and seek the world, but she doesn't want to abandon her father and Calista, who need her. The additional stress of falling in love with someone she can't have erodes her composure all the more. The situation is compelling, and while the movie resolves in a way that could be called satisfactory, the plot mechanics of the last 20 minutes seem a bit arbitrary. The filmmakers were clearly not interested in the ending but in exploring the characters and the situation, and they do that with sophistication and genuine feeling, both for the people and the environment. We all know the jokes people make about trailer parks, but people do live in such places, and they do so not because they're trailer trash but because they don't have a lot of money. It's nice to see a movie use such a location for such a warm, heartfelt picture. It's also nice to see Bruckner and Garner, just as they're coming into their prime bimbo years, getting treated with respect and given the opportunity to prove they can carry a serious drama. May they be this lucky for the rest of their careers. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, drug use. ",1
"E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL: Children's fantasy. Starring Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore and Dee Wallace Stone. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Not every popular movie becomes a classic in 20 years. Most just get older. E.T. is a fine picture because it can still, without fail, make an entire audience of children shut up and fall in love with a little green alien with big eyes and a turtlelike body. That's no small achievement. But Spielberg's sledgehammer way with emotional moments, never more obvious than here, kills some of the pleasure for adults and robs the movie of the ultimate laurel -- classic status. The impact of The Wizard of Oz has little to do with the flying monkeys. It has more to do with things like Judy Garland's singing Over the Rainbow. But the impact of E.T. is directly tied to an audience's response to a technological entity. While the movie's original audience couldn't help but be amazed by the phenomenon of E.T. himself -- that puppet seems alive -- time has burned away all the high-tech novelty that once made audiences confuse awe for spiritual uplift. That's why it was especially important for this film to be computer enhanced for rerelease: If audiences don't believe in E.T.'s reality, there's no movie. Accordingly, some of E.T.'s facial expressions were slightly altered, and his movements were made more lifelike. (Spielberg also removed guns from the hands of FBI agents and replaced them with walkie-talkies -- which they now, unaccountably, hold like guns.) For all the spiffing up, E.T. still looks like a 20-year-old movie. That's part of its charm. In 1982, professional men still had long hair. They wore sport jackets with thin lapels. Who remembered? And pastels were apparently in -- light blue paint for a suburban living room? Do people still do that? The charm of the film's age carries over into the effects. Today, E.T. would be an entirely digital entity, a computer graphic melded into a live- action setting. In E.T. there was actually a puppet on the set, lumbering around and interacting with people. Somehow that makes it all feel more grounded and complete. E.T., for the uninitiated, tells the story of a visitor from another planet who gets stuck on Earth and is befriended by a 10-year-old boy (Henry Thomas). From the first close-up of E.T., reacting with fear at the sight of the boy, the movie creates the illusion, not only that this animatronic contraption is a sentient being, but also that it's intelligent and sensitive. In a newly restored scene, which now seems essential, the boy and E.T. bond during a tour of the family bathroom. It turns out E.T. likes bathing. (The movie never resolves whether E.T. ever needs to use the bathroom for more prosaic functions.) The illusion of E.T.'s reality is complete when the mother (Dee Wallace Stone) opens a closet, and there's E.T., hiding amid the stuffed animals. The audience laughs at E.T.'s ruse before it has time to realize that -- wait -- he is a stuffed animal. In retrospect, one of the movie's strong points is unquestionably Drew Barrymore, a precocious little natural who already had the gift of comic timing at 6 years old. The movie needed comedy. It could have used some more. Likewise, the weaker element is the friendship that develops between E.T. and the boy. The friendship has two problems from the audience's perspective: It's maudlin, and we don't quite buy it. When the boy says, I love you, E.T., it comes as a surprise. Then again, by the I love you, E.T. part of the movie, Spielberg is laying it on with a shovel. At his worst -- and E.T. combines some of the filmmaker's best and worst traits -- Spielberg doesn't let you feel something. He instructs you in how to feel by panning to subordinate characters who are watching the same scene and experiencing the appropriate emotion. That's bad enough. What's worse is that sometimes, what Spielberg considers to be the appropriate emotion isn't. Here's the biggest scientific event of the last 2, 000 years, and E.T. asks us to see it entirely in personal terms. Yet despite some frustrating faults -- including a John Williams score vulgar enough for a biblical epic -- this is undoubtedly a movie of real beauty. The sight of a cornfield at night, a green haze blending into a dark blue sky, is lovely to behold. And there's something wordlessly grand about the moment when that bicycle moves across the moon. Maybe 20 years have just conditioned us to love it, but I don't think so. E.T. may not be a classic movie, but it has some classic moments. ",1
"ELECTION: Black comedy. Starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) We see young Tracy through the eyes of her teacher, Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick). To Mr. McAllister, there's something just a bit scary about this chipper young go-getter, something unsavory, something even potentially evil. His obsession with her is irrational, and yet one wonders if this Tracy might not really be a monster, a kind of Hitler in the crib. Election, which opens today, is a black comedy that takes off in unexpected directions. The good guy of the story is a sad-sack histo ry teacher with a predilection for porn and a marriage that's failing. The villain is Miss Perfect. What makes the teacher the hero and the student the villain is hard to say. Tracy does nothing monumentally horrible. Yet the viewer looks at her smiling face and cold eyes and knows that person. Something inside just cringes. We get a clue to Tracy's character in the first few minutes. She has an affair with one of her teachers (Mark Harelik, a former American Conservatory Theater actor), and when it's discovered, he's drummed out of the profession. Next thing he knows he's divorced and working a minimum-wage job in another state. Tracy is sorry, so sorry, and yet she's not sorry. Someone else's pain just doesn't penetrate. We realize: If something bad happens, it won't be to her. That Tracy is both the perfect student and sexually amoral is an unexpected combination, but like everything else in Election, which was directed by Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth), it rings true. Characters are complicated in ways that make them stand out from the typical. Mr. McAllister is an upstanding fellow, a likable teacher, but he also has a secret stash of porn videos in his attic. Motives are complicated, too. Mr. McAllister looks at Tracy and sees the face of selfishness, blind ambition, cruel power -- someone who can turn into a world-class menace if given half the chance. At the same time, he may just be frustrated that he's feeling middle- aged and has hit a dead end in his life. That he fears Tracy and at the same time finds her physically at tractive should say less about her and more about what's going on in his tortured mind. And yet . . . Tracy is a sociopath. We can see it in Witherspoon's face -- what a fun, fierce actress she is. Just contemplating Tracy, who knows exactly where her life is going, makes her teacher, a lost and confused adult, go into a tailspin. Broderick has never been better. He's taking on water from his first minutes on screen, and soon he's sinking and flailing. Watching his misery is a perverse delight. The screenplay by Payne and Jim Taylor, based on the novel by Tom Perrotta, sees the lives of these suburban students and teachers through a prism of absurdity that refracts more truth than any straightforward telling. Jessica Campbell is oddly moving as Tammy, a lesbian student who runs for president on the promise of abolishing the student government. Perrotta has said he got the idea for her character from Ross Perot's first presidential bid. Sometimes when I'm sad, Tammy says in a forlorn voice- over, I look at the power station. It's all there in a single image. Suburban teen angst: a girl sitting in the grass, staring off at a power plant humming in the night. ",1
"EMPIRE: Drama. Starring John Leguizamo, Peter Sarsgaard and Denise Richards. Directed by Franc. Reyes. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The result is that Empire -- the debut film of Arenas Entertainment, a Latino division of Universal Pictures -- is a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise. People do unexpected things and for reasons we wouldn't anticipate. Even the tone of familiar scenes is just a little different. Gangland hits here are more clumsy and personal, more small-town and familial, than in the usual gangster movie. The fresh take makes for a fresh experience. Written and directed by Franc. Reyes, Empire tells the story of a South Bronx heroin dealer, Victor (John Leguizamo), who sees himself as a businessman in the tradition of Carnegie, Rockefeller and Bill Gates. Other movie crooks have compared themselves to legitimate businessmen as a way of rationalizing their crimes, but Victor is something different: He really believes it. This healthy self-image gives Victor a spring in his step and a distinctly American belief in his own destiny. To his mind, he's not at war with his country's values but is the embodiment of its entrepreneurial spirit. Underneath his gold chain beats the heart of a natural Republican. Reyes, in his first feature, relies on lots of voice-over narration from Victor's point of view. Reyes doesn't use it awkwardly, as many beginning filmmakers do, for the sake of plugging holes in the narrative. The narration is built into the fabric and is used audaciously -- not as flashy as the narration in, say, Scorsese's Casino or GoodFellas, but getting there. Victor's aspirations make it inevitable that he'll someday try to go legit, and he sees his opportunity one night when he meets Jack, an investment banker played by Peter Sarsgaard. Jack is one of those 30-year-old geniuses that, until recently, actually existed: Ivy League education, first million at 25, Midas touch with the stock market. Jack has a great Manhattan townhouse and lots of investment opportunities for Victor. Sarsgaard conveys the ease of a young man at home with wealth and all it buys. He talks big numbers -- $60 million, $600 million -- like someone who lives in that world. Jack is low-key, shrewd, sure of himself. Sarsgaard's performance is persuasive in every way and makes it clear why Victor, who's a prince in his own sphere, would look at Jack in awe. It's not just Jack's money that Victor aspires to. It's his relaxation. Leguizamo keeps Victor sympathetic by emphasizing his intelligence and his desire for a more genteel life. When Victor goes back to the old neighborhood, after living for several months in a downtown loft, he feels he has nothing to say to his old friends and wants nothing to do with his old life. His girlfriend (Delilah Cotto) is disgusted by his snobbishness and by his inability to recognize his real friends, but director Reyes is wise enough to keep the movie's point of view ambiguous. Maybe Victor doesn't belong in the dishonest glamour of downtown, but the honest bleakness of the South Bronx is no haven, either. Empire is set in the days of peace and prosperity, as Jack puts it, and it has the New York skyline shots of the World Trade Center to prove it. Jack, Victor, the stock market and New York itself are right on the edge, and the audience can feel it. In the end, the story of Empire gets completely crazy, and pretty improbable, as if Reyes quit writing about what he knew and started throwing in any wild thing he could think of. Still, the movie stays compelling, if only because we can never guess where it might go. . This film contains lots of graphic violence, harsh language and some sexual situations. ",1
"ENOUGH: Thriller. Starring Jennifer Lopez and Billy Campbell. Directed by Michael Apted. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To maintain that emotional pitch, it's not enough for a movie to simply show a man smacking a woman. Everything has to work, and it does, from the Everywoman appeal of Lopez to the cunning direction of Michael Apted, who squeezes every drop of suspense from every setup. Most of all, it's the screenplay by Nicholas Kazan (Reversal of Fortune) that transforms an arresting premise into a thriller of significance. Kazan's most important inspiration was in the writing of the husband, who is not a routine psycho who sprouts devil horns on the honeymoon. If Mitch were the husband from hell, Enough would be a monster movie. Instead he's a husband from earth, a fellow we recognize, a kind of man we might know, one who prides himself on getting what he wants, whose self-conception is tied up with his willingness to go to any length to succeed. Mitches are everywhere, and that alone gives Enough a modest social importance. Lopez plays Slim, who meets Mitch (Billy Campbell) while working as a waitress. A few years later, they have a little daughter and a nice house, and all is well. There are only vague hints that he might have a vicious streak. He has a strange, impassive way of looking at his wife when she's not facing him. Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her. She has a nice crackup scene when Slim finds out Mitch is cheating on her, and when he hits her for the first time -- What, I can't hit you? -- we feel her terror. Her big house has just become the Big House. She's living in a prison. From this point on, Enough becomes agonizingly suspenseful and nerve- wracking. There are moments when the entire audience will stop breathing all at once. Slim moves to San Francisco, moves to Seattle, moves to Michigan. She changes her hair, changes her name, changes her daughter's name, wears sunglasses. Yet we know, and the director never lets us forget, that at any moment this maniac -- or one of his minions -- might be around the corner, or at the door, or hiding behind the shower curtain. Juliette Lewis does well in the gently comic role of Slim's best friend, and Dan Futterman radiates warmth and decency as the man Slim should have married. Then again, any man would be the man Slim should have married. For the most part, Slim goes through the movie cut off from friends and family, alone with her daughter, played by newcomer Tessa Allen, who's a find. Enough has an odd title, in the sense that it gives away about two-thirds of the story. We know going in that sooner or later Slim will decide that she has had enough and go on the attack. Yet knowing that serves a function. We know there's hope. Likewise, when Enough ultimately takes a turn into straight, unapologetic melodrama, we register two things simultaneously: recognition that the movie has shifted into a predictable groove, and relief at the prospect of getting tossed some red meat. If Enough were merely realistic, it might be too much to take. Besides, it's realistic enough. It depicts something that needs to be depicted, a husband who sincerely considers the woman in his life to be his property. He can't think of himself as a villain. He can't begin to, since his behavior is just the logical consequence of that deadly assumption. ",1
"ERIN BROCKOVICH: Drama. Starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Stars bring their own reality to films. With Roberts, reality has been honed to a handful of ironclad laws over the past decade: 1) She's not vulgar, she's spunky; 2) Even nice gals dress like harlots; 3) If she raves and curses at people, it's because they're all stuffed shirts and phonies; and 4) She may look, sound and act like a nitwit, but make no mistake -- she's Einstein in a push-up bra. Erin Brockovich, which opens today, takes these tried-and-true tenets and almost turns them into pillars of a religion. The film gives Roberts her ideal role, playing a real- life woman who apparently did dress flashily, talk tough and turn out to be brilliant. Erin Brockovich is the apotheosis of every woman Roberts has played. The film is based on the true story of Brockovich, a divorced mother of three with no education and no prospects who did something extraordinary. While working as a file clerk for a small law firm, she came across papers that showed that Pacific Gas & Electric was paying the medical bills of residents of a small California town. She began investigating and ultimately provided the documentation for a huge class-action lawsuit, claiming that the pow er company's pollution of groundwater had resulted in gruesome health problems. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape, Out of Sight), it's a true David and Goliath story, which gives it built-in interest. Albert Finney plays Ed Masry, who owns the law firm, a small operation going up against a $28 billion company. Just coming up with the money and the staff to handle that kind of lawsuit could be crippling. Roberts, as Brockovich, is shown visiting victims of the polluted water. Among them are a little girl bald from chemotherapy and another woman, suffering from breast cancer, whose husband has lymphoma. One of the strongest moments is a quiet one, in which Brockovich persuades a woman (Marg Helgenberger) that her illness is the result not of bad luck but of bad water. The truth registers on the woman's face, and she gets up and orders her children out of the swimming pool. Soderbergh is a highly stylized director, but this time he shows his cinematic intelligence by going against expectations. He doesn't even try to merge his style with Roberts'. He puts himself at her service entirely. In fact, if Soderbergh were any more self-effacing, Erin Brockovich would play like a parody of a Julia Roberts movie. As it stands, every action onscreen is funneled through her reaction. Nothing can happen, no one can say anything and no scene can end without the camera on Roberts, whose face lets viewers know how they should feel about things. Sometimes she tears up. Sometimes she smiles. Sometimes she sighs, as if to say, Whew, that was hard. Roberts is a self-indulgent actress, whose approach to every scene is to get either angry or self-pitying, but Soderbergh plays it up until Roberts' reality becomes the audience's. It's Julia's world. Everyone else is just living there. At the same time, Soderbergh doesn't let any performance get lost. Though Finney's main function is to act befuddled by his tempestuous clerk, the audience comes into a full sense of this fellow as a decent guy coasting toward retirement who gradually becomes re-energized. The film also is full of strong character bits. Veanne Cox creates a mini-masterpiece of comic subtlety as a buttoned-down lawyer who makes the mistake of condescending to Erin. The movie slows down only when it deals with Erin's personal life. Aaron Eckhart is sweet as the saintly biker who watches Erin's kids all day, but it's all a bit too much. Movies have to act gingerly when they depict real people, and the result is dullness. Fortunately, the main focus is the lawsuit, and that's a story worth following, even for those of us who are less than enamored of Roberts' face in close-up. .. ",1
"ESCAPE PLAN Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone   Ph: Steve Dietl  © 2013 Summit Entertainment, LLC.  All rights reserved.ESCAPE PLAN Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone Ph: Steve Dietl © 2013 Summit Entertainment, LLC. All rights reserved. Action. Starring Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Mikael Hafstrom. (R. 116 minutes.) Escape Plan pairs Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in roles they could just as easily have taken on 20 years ago, so there's nothing cute about it, no plea for indulgence, no reliance on nostalgia. It's not a movie about two old guys who come back, but a straight-ahead action movie meant to be taken on its own terms. It succeeds in doing something difficult: It blends the Stallone and Schwarzenegger universes. This might seem like no big deal - weren't they both huge action stars of the 1980s? Yes, but there the similarity ends. Schwarzenegger is essentially a comedian who specializes in cruelty. His whole appeal is that he's impervious. He exists in a universe in which nothing can hurt him. In fact, half the fun of a Schwarzenegger movie is watching others catch on to his invincibility, usually a few seconds too late. Stallone is the opposite. He's a dramatist, and everything hurts him. He's like some agonized, fleshly version of a Michelangelo sculpture or, better yet, like St. Sebastian, the beautiful man who got stuck with all those arrows. Schwarzenegger could never play St. Sebastian in a movie, but Stallone could. Can't you almost hear him grunting as he pulls out each arrow ... and then the dead stare, as he looks into the camera and figures out how he's going to kill somebody standing there with a bow?  The first smart thing Escape Plan does is make one of them the main focus. In this case, it's Stallone, so basically we're watching a Stallone world. He plays Ray, a security expert whose job is to figure out the weaknesses of maximum-security prisons from the inside. He goes in, undercover, and then breaks out. The career is difficult enough, but it gets worse when he takes a job testing out a CIA prison. There he realizes there's no escape. Ever.  It takes about a half hour for Arnold to show up on the scene. The camera moves in on his eyes, and the audience, at the screening I saw, immediately started laughing - as they're supposed to. Schwarzenegger, playing a German anarchist stuck in the CIA prison, is Stallone's comic relief. Soon the men meet every day, studying prison patterns and plotting their escape, and just as Ray and Emile (Schwarzenegger) develop a convincing rapport, so do the two actors. It's a pleasure to watch them together.  The men are pitted against Jim Caviezel as the warden, who plays him as a cold sadist, a sort of bureaucratic Caligula. In fact, the cast is first-rate down the line, with Vincent D'Onofrio as Ray's jumpy business partner, Amy Ryan as Ray's friend on the outside and Sam Neill lending the weight of his presence to a small role as the prison doctor. Escape Plan may be an action movie, but it's in the scenes between the action that the movie stands out. Director Mikael Hafstrom strikes a good tonal balance that allows him to take advantage of lighter moments without losing anything in dramatic intensity. He doesn't lean on the screen legends of his stars, but he knows when to wink at the audience, too. At one point, Schwarzenegger has occasion to pick up an enormous machine gun, and suddenly it's the '80s again and all is right with the world. So chalk Escape Plan up as a pretty good action movie given an extra edge by the intelligent use of its two main actors. And if you ever want to see a classic example of a movie that tried to do something similar but didn't quite succeed, take a look at Smart Money, the 1931 Warner Bros. film that tried to marry the worlds of the two great gangster actors of the day, Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. Somehow it didn't work - marriages like that aren't easy. ",1
"Eastern Promises: Thriller. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent Cassel. Directed by David Cronenberg. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A man sits in a London barber's chair in the first scene of Eastern Promises, and because David Cronenberg directed the movie, the only question is exactly how he'll end up in a pool of blood. Cronenberg gives the audience just enough time to guess - and just enough time to wonder how the victim doesn't  guess - when the straight-edge razor is produced, the throat is cut, the feet start kicking, etc. That opening sets in motion one important strain in this tightly plotted and economically told film. The next begins in a drugstore, where a teenage girl shows up asking for help. She's pregnant - and hemorrhaging, of course - and is rushed to Trafalgar hospital, where we meet Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife. The mother dies, and a baby is born (covered in blood). No one knows the dead mother's identity, but she's left a diary, in Russian, and a business card for a restaurant. With these clues, Anna sets out on what she expects will be an innocent quest to find out the dead woman's name and next of kin.Two things need to be said about the first minutes of Eastern Promises. Cronenberg has too much self-awareness and too much of a place in the public mind not to know that he's doing a Cronenberg. He is announcing himself, and it's as obvious, say, as beginning a Scorsese movie with Frank Vincent's getting pummeled with a shovel. And yet - the big and yet - these are not merely shock tactics. As with Hitchcock, Cronenberg's self-awareness (even to the point of self-parody) can't disguise a genuine, unmistakable and endlessly fetching case of neurosis. His vision is helplessly keyed into the physical. Things everyone else finds easy to ignore - the fact, for example, that social, public and even spiritual life depends on the maintenance of physical existence, that everything, in a sense, runs on blood - are things he can't forget and doesn't let us forget. So we have a midwife, who is up to the elbows in the bloody business of welcoming life. And she goes to meet Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who unbeknownst to her, is up to his elbows in death. On the surface, an amiable and paternal restaurateur, he is a powerful underworld figure, and he immediately recognizes that diary for what it is - a threat to himself and his empire. That empire includes Viggo Mortensen as Nikolai, a Russian chauffeur. This is Mortensen and Cronenberg's second collaboration - the first was A History of Violence - and it's turning into a beautiful friendship. Mortensen's aura, here and elsewhere, suggests an acceptance and a familiarity with the absolute worst. He's at home with the very things that Cronenberg obsesses on. For most scenes, Cronenberg matches Mortensen with Vincent Cassel, who plays the mob boss' drunken son. Putting these two in the same frame is sheer inspiration. They're the same height and the same coloring; they're roughly the same age, and Cassel is ugly-handsome in the way that Mortensen is handsome.  Cassel's menacing looks have caused him to be tapped to play self-assured villains in his American films. But he gets to do more here, playing a villain who is dangerous precisely because he's insecure and afraid to reveal himself. The result is Cassel's best English-language performance. Though the movies have different authors - Steven Knight (Amazing Grace) wrote this one - Eastern Promises and A History of Violence share a family resemblance beyond the casting of Mortensen in a central role. In terms of story, the films deal with the possible encroachment of a ruthless mob into the lives of ordinary people. In terms of storytelling, they demonstrate an expert command of narrative. Cronenberg rushes through plot material without seeming to be rushing and then buys the right to lavish time on arresting set pieces, such as a Russian Mafia initiation (in which the applicant stands virtually naked before a panel of judges) and a gruesome attempted mob hit inside a steam room. If Eastern Promises doesn't quite match A History of Violence, it's because something in the denouement is lacking. It's just a little too inevitable and not quite as rich and complex as the movie might lead one to hope. But take this as no more than a quibble. Eastern Promises is otherwise a thoroughly entertaining film by a director at the height of his ability.-- Advisory: Female nudity, male frontal nudity, gore and simulated sex.",1
"Elf: Comedy. Starring Will Ferrell, James Caan and Mary Steenburgen. Directed by Jon Favreau. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Instead, Elf is funny and intelligently made, a film for kids and adults that's both sweet and sardonic. It takes the clash between the world as we know it and the world as it exists in Christmas stories and exploits that contrast to expert comic effect. Then it does something even more difficult -- it comes in for a landing without banking too hard either in the direction of cynicism or sentiment. Elf stays perfectly in balance, a pleasure throughout. Will Ferrell plays the dementedly cheerful Buddy, a human being who, through a mishap, was brought up as an elf at Santa's North Pole toy factory. The first minutes make good use of the sight gag of Buddy, who is huge and has no idea he doesn't belong, coping with tiny elf beds, chairs and toilets. Elf is a comedy of incongruity, but Buddy's physical incongruity in elfland is nothing compared with the psychological incongruity of Buddy in New York City. That's where screenwriter David Berenbaum and director Jon Favreau hit the comic mother lode. See, Buddy finds out that he is not originally from the North Pole. He's from New York, and so he travels there, looking for a father who doesn't know he exists. The casting of the father couldn't be more ideal -- James Caan, who's not at all known as a comic actor and therefore not as cuddly as, say, fellow tough-guy Robert De Niro. He plays a grasping, hard-nosed publishing executive, and he seems like exactly that, not an exaggerated version, but the real thing. It's the key to the movie -- the way Favreau directs Caan. Favreau has the veteran actor play it straight, and the result is that his sourness becomes a superb counterpoint to Ferrell's good cheer. I've been laughing for days at the way Caan, as Buddy's father, prepares his wife (Mary Steenburgen) for her first meeting with Buddy. His face is a mask of weariness and disgust. He just can't believe what a terrible day he's having. He grumbles, He thinks he's an elf. Previous to this movie, Favreau wrote the romantic comedy Swingers and wrote and directed the mob comedy, Made. Elf shows that he can make a film ostensibly outside his swinging urban milieu and from another writer's script and yet still have it come out sounding like a Jon Favreau movie. There's a satiric sensibility and an affection for extreme choices here that feel like a comedic signature: When Buddy finds out that he's not an elf, he runs stumbling and weeping through the snow like Jane Wyman in a '50s melodrama. Favreau's achievement should in no way take credit away from Berenbaum, whose screenplay devises a series of irresistible situations. Just one example: When Buddy finds out that Santa is coming to Gimbels, he assumes it will be the real Santa (Edward Asner), not a helper. So the audience spends minutes looking forward to Buddy's explosion when he finds out that the Gimbels Santa is an impostor. As Buddy, Ferrell plays a happy idiot with heroic intensity and variety. Buddy is as uncontainable as a 6-year-old. It's a terrific comic performance, completely invested, physically energetic and utterly relentless. ",1
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: Comedy/drama. Starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Directed by Michel Gondry. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's written by Charlie Kaufman, who has done similar work in his previous films (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation). The thinking is shallow. The emotions are tepid. But the creativity is dazzling. If that sounds like a slam, consider that most Hollywood screenplays are predictable, rote and functional -- and those are the good ones, folks. Eternal Sunshine,  at the very least, is an encounter with an imagination and a personality. That tips it toward the positive. What pushes it further into the zone of good-movie-hood is the seamless and visually stimulating work of director Michel Gondry in executing a screenplay full of intricate shifts in time, reality and perspective. Then there are the stars, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, whom I've saved for last, not as a reflection on their work -- they're both lovely here -- but because this is the rare Hollywood film in which the actors are of, at best, tertiary importance. This is a writer's film. Then it's a director's film. Actually, credit should also be given to cinematographer Ellen Kuras -- and only then does it become time to talk about Carrey and Winslet. Over the past decade, Carrey has forged for himself a singular screen identity, one that combines the relentless invention, zaniness and poignancy of Robin Williams with the expressionist spasticity of Jerry Lewis. In a sense, he's Lewis grounded in reality, a Lewis that we have to take seriously: the funny guy with something genuinely wrong with him. His role in Eternal Sunshine is on the dark end of his acting spectrum. When we meet Joel (Carrey), he looks shell-shocked, riding a commuter train from New York into Long Island, lost, lonely and searching. On a train platform in Montauk, he meets a woman who's drawn to him for no apparent reason. She's Clementine (Kate Winslet), a blue-haired bookstore bohemian who's as aggressive as he is withdrawn. No sooner have they made their first halting steps toward romance when packages arrive at their respective addresses. They're from a scientific institute and contain a tape of each talking to a doctor about their relationship. Apparently, they were once lovers, but they had such a difficult, unhappy time that they each had the memory of the other permanently erased. The film zigzags through time. The most impressive sequence -- albeit somewhat slow-moving -- is the one in which Joel, unconscious, undergoes the memory-erasing process, while two technicians (Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst) get stoned and hang out in his bedroom. The movie shifts smoothly back and forth from the activity in the room to the memories in Joel's mind, to Joel's fantasies. Wanting to hold onto his memories of Clementine, Joel scrambles to hide her in remote corners of his mind, such as scenes of childhood humiliation. The filmmaking is deft enough to show, at times, snippets from the technicians' conversation floating into Joel's mind and influencing his fantasies. Winslet is tough. She is even tougher than Helena Bonham Carter, zeroing in on any sign of human weakness with the eye of a predatory bird. And, of course, Joel is all weakness, so we just wait for her to pick his insides apart. Winslet plays it just right -- not vicious, but simply too smart, too lively, too tortured and too contemptuous not to demolish whomever she can. The film's missing element is emotion. If we cared about Joel and Clementine as a couple, the movie might inspire a more passionate interest. But that's just not the movie the filmmakers wanted to make. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is not about how love conquers all but about how people can be weak and foolish and waste their lives on stupid, destructive relationships. It's a cold movie about love that was meant to be cold. In fact, the cold feels good for a change. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language, sexual situations and drug use. ",1
"Evening: Drama. Starring Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson, Claire Danes, Patrick Wilson and Toni Collette. Directed by Lajos Koltai. (PG-13. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Picture it: A white-haired woman lies drugged and hooked up to oxygen, in a dark room that she'll never leave. Then she closes her eyes, and it's summertime, more than 40 years ago, and suddenly she's lithe and has auburn hair. She has a smile full of mischief and expectation and hasn't a clue that she'll ever be a sick old lady. Susan Minot writes something like this in her novel Evening, upon which the movie is based, but this is precisely the thing that cinema can do better than literature: Put together two images, and other emotions and meanings emerge. Evening could have been one of those movies -- you know, the kind where everybody is morose and has deep feelings, and everything comes with a tear and a smile, and there are grand revelations that are actually small and tepid, and viewers leave the theater with the taste of medicine in their mouths: Take it and like it; it was probably good for you. In fact, Evening seems as if it's going to be one of those, at first, but there's too much of a living pulse here. The constant shifting between today and years ago is, in and of itself, powerful. If you want to appreciate Danes' youthful radiance, just behold it from the story's standpoint: that it's not only already gone from the world but that even the memory of it is about to be extinguished. Likewise if you want to appreciate the history that Redgrave brings to every line, the visual aid of actually seeing the big events of the character's life makes Redgrave's accomplishment all the more clear. Things like that get Evening halfway down the track, and there's more. In depicting the weekend that Ann (Redgrave) remembers on her sickbed, director Lajos Koltai conveys both how the weekend truly was and how it might have seemed to the young Ann (Danes), seeing Newport for the first time. She's there for the wedding of a friend (Mamie Gummer), and though the issues presented are serious -- the friend's not sure she wants to go through with the wedding -- there's a nostalgic quality to the treatment. The nostalgia is not for anything specific to the time and place but for that time in life in general, before the irrevocable decisions were made and the doors started closing. As she relives a brief romance with a handsome doctor (Patrick Wilson), the audience gets to see Ann's past and her reality. Toni Collette plays the reckless daughter who wants to know the meaning behind her mother's delirious mumblings, while Natasha Richardson (Redgrave's real-life daughter) plays the more reserved daughter, who is content not to know. Both give emotionally ready performances. The movie also provides the treat of seeing Meryl Streep, in a featured role, playing opposite Redgrave in a single scene. Whenever something like this happens -- as when Fred Astaire danced with Gene Kelly -- it's almost spoiled by our expectations, but the spectacle of the two greatest English-speaking actresses sharing a frame together is something to be savored. Ultimately, Evening achieves a kind of wisdom, though it's a strange and bitter wisdom. Written by Minot and Michael Cunningham, the film arrives at a pessimistic and almost nihilistic view of life as something not very important -- and then invites us to take strength and comfort in the notion. It's not what you'd expect, and it's certainly not the typical message. It might be most interesting thing about the picture. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, adult themes. ",1
"Ever since “Bridesmaids” launched her movie career four years ago, Melissa McCarthy has not had an easy time in pictures. With the exception of “The Heat,” in which she co-starred opposite Sandra Bullock, McCarthy’s movies have not only been disappointing, but suggested that filmmakers had no idea what to do with her. She has been too sentimental (“Tammy,” “St. Vincent”) or too harsh (“Identity Thief”), and she has only been funny in small doses, as in “This Is 40.” It had begun to seem as though McCarthy was a natural supporting comic and should not be headlining movies — but now comes “Spy,” the first film to make a real case for her as a name-above-the-the-title star. It’s an important movie for her and comes not a moment too soon, a comic delight that showcases her in a range of modes. Everything anybody likes about Melissa McCarthy is contained in this movie.Engagingly hostileShe has subtle moments of comic acting, in which she has to react to people with a complexity of emotion. She gets to show her abilities as a straight man, suppressing frustration at the clueless people around her. The movie showcases her slapstick ability, too, her inspired silliness; and it also gives her a chance to be aggressive and verbally abusive. Nobody is better than McCarthy at over-the-top comic hostility.It’s no surprise that “Spy” was written and directed by someone who knows what McCarthy can do — Paul Feig, who directed her best movies, “Bridesmaids” and “The Heat.” “Spy” has the feel of something tailored for a specific performer, and it’s a perfect fit. At the start of the movie, Susan works for the CIA, but in a humble capacity — in a basement office at Langley that’s infested by mice and rats. (The vermin infestation is a zany extra touch, recurring throughout the movie, and it says something about Feig’s willingness to pursue and get a laugh.) Susan’s job is to read the heat-sensitive map and give her super-spy in the field (Jude Law) moment-by-moment instructions, and it’s very clear, as she does, that she can barely contain her crush on him.When a terrorist network busts the identities of the CIA’s entire staff of field operatives, the director has no choice but to turn to someone the terrorists don’t already know. And so Susan is sent to Paris to follow and report on the various terrorists’ activities. She has the usual assortment of secret weapons and gadgets, but as her alias is unglamorous, the gadgets are disguised as things like hemorrhoid wipes, antifungal toe spray and stool softener. A running joke throughout the movie is that the CIA keeps giving her covert identities that make her look like “someone’s homophobic aunt.”Well-cast charactersJason Statham, who can be very funny but rarely gets the chance, plays a blustering rogue agent who can’t stop bragging about his exploits — for example, he had his arm blown off but reattached it with his other arm, or he jumped from a building using nothing but a raincoat as a parachute — though it’s clear that he’s a liar and a fumbler. As the amoral daughter of a notorious terrorist, Rose Byrne is ideally matched with McCarthy, as her opposite in look, manner and temperament.“Spy” is two hours long, a bit of a stretch for a comedy, but it doesn’t seem long at all and keeps finding ways to renew its energy. It was filmed in Paris and Budapest, two highly photogenic cities, and they help. If you’re just writing a screenplay, you might as well set it in any hellhole, but if you’re both writing and directing, Paris and Budapest are inspired choices. Everyone involved seems to have had a good time with “Spy,” and so will the audience.",1
"Everyone has an opinion about every war. Everyone has feelings about it. Everything that happens in a war is greeted by people as supporting whatever point of view they already have. And pro-war or antiwar, people always think they “support the troops.” Yet in truth, the only ones who really know what a war is like are the people who actually fight it.Ang Lee’s new film, “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” — based on Ben Fountain’s novel of the same name — explores the alienation of a young man who returns from the Iraq War to a hero’s reception, but can’t reconcile his own real war experience with how he’s perceived by others. Taking place mostly over the course of a single day, it’s a smart and languorous film that finds time to luxuriate in conversations and to create a feeling for small-town American life.“Billy Lynn” is set in 2004, at a time when the Iraq War had already lost support. When a battle is caught on video, the members of the small Bravo Company become temporary national celebrities, especially 19-year-old Billy, who was seen trying to rescue a fallen soldier. Bravo Company is brought home for a publicity tour, culminating in a Thanksgiving Day appearance at halftime of the Dallas Cowboys game. Now it’s the last day of the tour, and tomorrow the men return to the front lines.Though most of the film shows the action from Billy’s perspective, the movie’s point of view is complicated and olympian. The most pure thing, the most unsullied good thing, in the entire film is the love and brotherhood between the soldiers themselves. Though politics and the public may fail them, they will not fail each other. Yet at the same time, the movie doesn’t quite share the men’s point of view in valuing their personal connection above all else. Hovering inside the scope of the film’s thought is the suggestion that all this love and brotherhood is itself a form of trap, something that outside power counts on to make these young men easy to manipulate.None of this is overtly stated, just touched on, lightly grazed. There’s subtlety in the script and in the direction. The movie reminds us that Billy knows things that other people don’t, what it’s like to be tested under fire, what it’s like to kill an enemy in hand-to-hand combat. But Joe Alwyn’s performance doesn’t let us forget that, aside from those monumental experiences of life and death, Billy doesn’t know squat. He’s just a kid and barely knows himself, much less what’s best for him.The movie reminds us that it’s the poor in this country that end up doing most of the volunteering and fighting. The scenes of Billy visiting his folks back home are truthful without being condescending. The father is debilitated by some unnamed illness, and the mother is haggard and fraught. The sister — there’s always one in every family — is kind of great, an independent thinker desperate to get her brother out of the military for good. She’s played by Kristen Stewart, with her usual breezy precision.Everyone has an agenda. Everyone sees the soldiers’ sacrifice as a personal justification, as a reason to take a victory lap. There’s the fracking entrepreneur (Tim Blake Nelson), who thinks that somehow his getting rich is a contribution to the war effort. There’s the team owner (Steve Martin), who sees the men as a potent symbol that can be used to inspire. Even the cheerleader (Makenzie Leigh) who wants to have sex with Billy isn’t really interested in him, but in the fantasy of being handmaiden to a Christian warrior.It will be interesting to see how people react to this film. Some, I suspect, will misinterpret it as a story about the purity of the military, in contrast to the corruption and ignorance of the civilian world. But that’s not it. “Billy Lynn” is saying something more sophisticated and more challenging, that war itself creates the lies, that war functions on illusions and manipulations that are systemic, oppressive and, alas, sometimes even necessary. It’s saying something else, too, that when it comes right down to it, most people would prefer to be fooled. ",1
"FAITHLESS: Drama. Starring Lena Endre, Erland Josephson, Krister Henriksson and Thomas Hanzon. Directed by Liv Ullmann. (R. 145 minutes. In Swedish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) Those consequences are life-shattering. The emotions are huge. Bergman, who once shocked audiences by showing the passion underneath the facade of repression, has not changed, but audiences have. What was once unsettling is now also reassuring. Bergman, rare among artists these days, still believes in human complexity and value. He believes that what people do matters. When a talent of Bergman's stature reaches his 80s, it makes sense to pay attention to what he offers -- to turn around and listen, like the people in the old E.F. Hutton commercials. Faithless is very much the statement of an old man. Loosely autobiographical, it shows a filmmaker named Bergman (Erland Josephson), looking back on a tragic mess he helped create some years before. Lena Endre, who is extraordinary, plays Marianne, who appears in Bergman's study as he sits down to write a screenplay about a love affair. She tells the story from her point of view: She was a successful actress, happily married to a world-famous conductor. Then, one day, she looked at David (Krister Henriksson), a longtime friend for whom she'd only felt a sisterly affection, and something clicked. That click is not superficial attraction. The characters are in their 40s, and the connection is more existential and inexorably hungry -- something that happens because of merciless, compressed time. When she kisses David, he says (in subtitle), This is serious. This is bloody serious. She assures him, Life needn't be a series of disasters. Oh, yeah? In Faithless, love and sex are matters of life and death. Choices are irreversible. Mistakes are uncorrectable. People discover who they are and who their lovers are. There is never any retreat from that grim knowledge, no winding back the clock, no opportunity for What I really meant was . . . People don't ask for forgiveness because they can't forgive themselves, either the lovers or the injured husband. The tragic procession is riveting, and yet one can't help but ask questions: Are these people enviable because they expect so much from themselves? Or are they contemptible because they fall so short of their ideals? Or are they ridiculous, in that they can't lighten up? Ever. These questions don't really intrude -- they're part of the experience -- and much of the film is so wrenching there's no time for idle thoughts. Though Bergman's screenplay is fixated on a single moment of betrayal late in the film, Ullmann is sensitive to every nuance of faithlessness. In fact there is no more powerful moment than when Marianne looks at her daughter and realizes what her actions have done to her. ",1
"FAR FROM HEAVEN: Drama. Starring Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid and Dennis Haysbert. Directed by Todd Haynes. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Far From Heaven, writer-director Todd Haynes set out to make a film within the style and color palette of a Douglas Sirk 1950s melodrama. He succeeded. The screen is awash with clashing, oversaturated pastels, and Julianne Moore, as a '50s housewife named Cathy, wears the unclouded smile we see on young matrons in old Look and Life magazines -- their pleated skirts caught in midswirl as they advertise cigarettes or Pontiacs. Look at that smile long enough, Haynes seems to be saying, and the strain is unmistakable. As Cathy, Moore smiles to make her soul opaque and to make her presence innocuous. She is living the upper-middle-class suburban dream of two kids and a successful husband, and she seems determined to go through life without ever once banging into the furniture and waking herself up. The wake-up comes with abrupt cruelty. One night she decides to surprise her husband by bringing dinner to his office and finds him making out with a man. Yes, Frank (Dennis Quaid) has a problem. He is married with children and longs to have sex with guys. To straighten himself out, as it were, he embarks on a regime of psychoanalysis (with the promise of some electroshock down the line) and starts drinking himself blotto. It's not a pretty picture. Cathy's discovery of her husband's homosexuality comes as a jolt. Haynes brings us into Cathy's dollhouse, makes us understand the parameters of her world, and then hits her with something as incongruous as a marlin across the kisser. We feel her disorientation and worry, and yet it's probably the last time Far From Heaven has any emotional impact. Haynes' surface 1950s may be impeccable -- the well-behaved kids, the lamb chops at dinner, even the notion of Miami as a vacation destination -- but we soon realize he can't blast through it to locate the characters' feelings or the era's true soul. Don't blame the actors. Moore and Quaid give committed and at times even wrenching performances, but it's as though we're looking at them under glass. Dennis Haysbert, as the black gardener with whom Cathy begins to fall in love, fares somewhat better, perhaps because he seems the most modern. There were no such African American love interests in '50s melodramas, and so Haysbert's performance is the least constrained by convention. As an exercise, Far From Heaven is never less than fascinating, but two- thirds in it becomes clear that the experiment is failing. Haynes' attempt to make a movie with the cathartic effect of a good '50s weepie falls into an emotional dead zone between melodrama and camp comedy. An audience that cackles knowingly one minute can't be expected to get all choked up the next. At the same time, the movie falls short of its attempt to say something true about the 1950s. Haynes took the form of '50s melodrama and added elements of homosexuality and racism so that we might say, Aha, this is what the '50s were really like. But Far From Heaven is based on a false assumption, that '50s melodramas such as Sirk's All That Heaven Allows (1955) were lying only in their details, in their unwillingness to be explicit. On the contrary, '50s melodramas were lies at their core -- false in every way, especially emotionally. To use such a fantasy framework for an exploration of serious issues is folly. Still, in the arts there are worse things than folly. Haynes has a made a big mess, but most people will probably congratulate him for it because they'll sense the generosity in the attempt and the very human failing at the heart of his mistake: He believed in those movies too much. . This film contains sexual situations. ",1
"Factotum: Comedy-drama. Starring Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Bent Hamer. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Factotum is a film about his early working life, based on his autobiographical second novel. A factotum is someone who does a wide variety of jobs, usually in a subordinate capacity, and in the film Henry Chinaski -- Bukowski's alter ego -- goes from job to job doing anything. He delivers ice, works in a pickle factory and gets a job dusting a huge statue. In his free time, and often during work hours, he gets drunk and has sex with alcoholic women. Factotum is a grim and sometimes funny examination of life on the margins and of a singular artist's world. What a world. Bukowski wrote with pristine clarity, and yet his existence, as presented here, looks like a muddle of alcoholism and encounters with pathetic, boring people. It's fascinating and, if true, rather amazing: In Factotum, he's not a man deciding to live poor so he can write. He's a man in his true element, a half step up from Skid Row, who somehow happens to be locked into some creative circuit. Though the stuff of his life looks absolutely barren of inspiration -- the same dives, the same rooming houses, the same conversations with the same kinds of drunks -- he's churning out three short stories a week. He's not Henry Miller, suffering for his art and trying to walk on the wild side. He belongs there, and he's not really suffering. Matt Dillon does good things with the role. He's a handsome actor and Bukowski was a rough-looking guy, but he deals with the disparity by giving himself an underbite and putting on a few extra pounds. He assumes an air of distraction, not of precious distance, but of something else. It's as if Henry's mechanism for receiving pain is either defective or channels right into his creative center without his having to feel it. Even more than the drinking, his impassiveness allows him to live this way. Henry's relationships seem random and, without alcohol, they'd have no basis. He meets Jan (Lili Taylor) and moves in with her, and this is all they do: drink, smoke, have sex, talk about drinking, look forward to drinking or talk about sex. There's no reason that any of this should be interesting to an audience. Go into any flophouse and the conversation would be the same. Yet it is interesting. The characters are in no way sentimentalized. Never are we invited to perceive some deep spiritual grandeur in Jan beneath her mental fuzziness and need. Yet, through the elements of the film -- Taylor's uncompromised performance, Bent Hamer's direction, and Hamer and Jim Stark's script -- we come to an understanding of what Jan's life means to her. The drinking and smoking are not just addictions but emblems of personal identity and definition, and her ridiculous relationship with Henry is love. Too often when the popular arts depict people who are different from most people, they take the obligatory sentimental default: But after all, we're all the same. Well, no. We're not all the same, and it's enriching to know the ways in which we're not. That's a high calling of art, to enable people to transcend their own experience and understand something different. Factotum does that. I should not leave off without mentioning two things -- that Marisa Tomei is in the film and very good as yet another kind of drunk; and that Factotum is funny in a distinct way. It's not a straight comedy. Nor is it a black comedy, because nothing is exaggerated. Rather, it finds the absurdity in everyday encounters. It's a deadpan comedy that looks upon the world with an honesty and impassiveness worthy of its protagonist -- and of the author standing behind him. -- Advisory: This film contains drug use, alcohol abuse, sex and nudity.

"Failure to Launch: Romantic Comedy. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew McConaughey, Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates. Directed by Tom Dey. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker look good in this movie, separately and together. They enjoy themselves, or create that illusion, and they give generous performances, in the sense that, shot by shot, they go out of their way to project thought and emotion in concentrated doses. To talk about it, this sounds like the most obvious thing imaginable, but in the actual doing of it, the successful landing of a screen personality takes skill, a conscious act of will and a personality worth conveying. These are qualities and abilities not always present in modern actors, and it's what we respond to in classic stars such as Gable and Claudette Colbert. Failure to Launch isn't It Happened One Night or even close, but McConaughey and Parker have that extra something. An intelligent case could be made for romantic comedy as the most interesting of genres. It's certainly the most restrictive. All romantic comedies have to end in pretty much the same way, or else they cease to be romantic comedies and become something else -- Romeo and Juliet, for example. It's a genre that offers no mystery or suspense, just spectacle: How will it happen? The details vary from era to era, even from decade to decade, and in those details we can read the development of a culture. Yet one thing has remained consistent, since the days of Gloria Swanson through today: There has to be people in it that audiences want to look at. A good suspense drama can sustain lackluster leads, but a romantic is all about who's in it. McConaughey, who plays Tripp -- a 35-year-old man who still lives with his parents -- mixes a superficial surface with an essence that suggests hidden depths of iciness, stubbornness, character strength and intelligence. He can play the beer drinking, nonsense-talking good ol' boy and the next minute, in close-up, let you know that there's more to this good ol' boy than you thought, or maybe more to good ol' boys, in general, than you ever expected. That's Tripp, a complicated man who lives a life without focus -- selling boats for a living, living out of an upstairs bedroom, and letting the years pile up. Parker plays Paula, a woman who has set up a business in which she romances guys who are still living with their parents. She gives them confidence and persuades them, ultimately, to move out. Getting a guy to like her is easy, she tells Tripp's parents. I look nice, find out what he likes, and pretend to like it, too. Failure to Launch is that familiar story, the love affair that begins under false pretenses. But screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember come up with some unexpected moves, unseen complications and comedy bits, a few ridiculous (otherwise harmless animals keep biting Tripp, for some reason), a few unnecessarily strenuous, but some genuinely funny. They also jazz things up by inserting that staple of musical comedy -- the funny couple, whose romantic development serves as an untroubled counterpoint to the main couple. All the performances are pitched at a generous level. Everyone's vivid, including Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as Tripp's overwhelmed parents, and when that happens, it's time to credit the director. Zooey Deschanel, an actress with her own distinct rhythms, is different here than in her other films, just as off-center and arresting as ever, but in a new less dreamy and more caustic way. Parker, though, is the heart of the movie, and anyone who doesn't especially like her would have little reason to especially like Failure to Launch. At its best, this is a showcase for her sensitive intelligence, her watchfulness, and her way of thinking and reacting. The Family Stone did nothing for Parker, but Failure to Launch makes a strong case for life after Sex and the City. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. ",1
"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer: Sci-fi adventure. Starring Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans. Directed by Tim Story. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies To say that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than the original isn't enough. The last one was awful, one of the worst movies of its year, while the new one is a pleasure, one of the most enjoyable pictures of the season. The last Fantastic Four was 106 minutes of water torture. The new one, instead of expanding in length, clocks in at a streamlined 92 minutes, but nothing about it seems truncated or small-scale. The stakes and the scope are tremendous, and yet the movie doesn't wallow in either. Director Tim Story and writers Don Payne and Mark Frost are at all times telling the story, moving the action forward. They do so from the first seconds: Something that looks like a meteor is flying all over the world, confounding weather patterns. In Japan, the sea turns to ice, and snow falls over the pyramids in Egypt. Electricity goes out all over Los Angeles, and everywhere this energy ball goes, it creates craters. It's strange enough that people start thinking this might be the end of the world. Come to think of it, that's not a bad guess. Meanwhile, everything is cozy with the Fantastic Four. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), the elastic man and group intellectual, is about to marry Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), who can make herself invisible at will. (This means he must always be faithful -- think about it.) Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), who is made of rock and looks like tree bark, is still going steady with the lovely non-superhero Alicia (Kerry Washington). And Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), whose gimmick is to fly around while on fire, is living the life of an eligible New York bachelor. They are urban dwellers, like all superheroes, and so when Reed and Sue opt for an outdoor wedding, they hold it on a rooftop. Or maybe they do this out of plot convenience: Before the rings are exchanged, the meteor flies by -- only, on closer look, it's not a meteor. It's a silver man on a silver surfboard, who looks like an Oscar statuette in motion. He has access to a seemingly unstoppable supply of energy, and he's sowing destruction everywhere. The Silver Surfer is played in body by Doug Jones and voiced by Laurence Fishburne, and both do beautiful, sensitive work -- it's the performance to take from the movie. Yet much of the Silver Surfer's movements and actions had to have been computer generated, too. The interesting thing here is that the line between what's real and what's manufactured is almost never noticeable -- certainly, it's barely thought of. The illusion is complete. It's complete in all the key moments, as well, from the battle in London, which endangers the Millennium Wheel, to the outer-space scenes, in which a creeping darkness threatens to cover the earth. About the only visual lapse in the picture is the blond wig that the dark-haired Alba wears to play Sue. It's even worse than the wig Kate Bosworth wore as Lois Lane in Superman Returns -- worse in that it might really be Alba's hair. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) shows up, too mean to die, oozing menace and mendacity, but, fortunately, the movie doesn't slow down for him. There are oblique attempts at making the film topical: For example, the Army brings in a torturer to interrogate an alien, because the alien has no human rights. But the truth is, Rise of the Silver Surfer doesn't aspire to much. It just happens to have the three things it needs -- velocity, artistry and a pretty good story. -- Advisory: Imperiled action heroes. ",1
"Fay Grim: Black comedy. Starring Parker Posey, James Urbaniak and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Hal Hartley. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) But a familiarity with Henry Fool is not only not necessary for those who'd see Fay Grim -- it could, in fact, even get in the way. That's because the action of Fay Grim doesn't logically follow from that of the earlier film, and to the extent it does, it diminishes its predecessor, taking an effective, straightforward story and adding a layer of nonsense. However, taken for what it is, Fay Grim has something. A major asset is Parker Posey in the title role, as Fay, the sister of Nobel Prize-winning poet Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and the estranged wife of Henry Fool, a drifter and would-be artist who, at the end of the last film, escaped to Europe to avoid arrest. Now some notebooks of Henry's -- which contained what he called his confessions -- apparently also contained secrets vital to the security of the United States, and the government wants Fay to go to Europe and collect them before they fall into the hands of enemy agents. To the extent the film has a point to make, it's that the world has become increasingly more irrational and dangerous in the nine years since we last saw these characters. The film is a response to these changes, and yet what does Hartley really have to say here, besides that America has gone paranoid and the world has gone crazy? These ideas are without sophistication or nuance, and they only come into play with regard to the external circumstances of the characters, not their internal lives. The movie makes this point, and then, without elaboration, continues to make it over and over. Yet Hartley fashions from these limited materials a film that is reasonably entertaining, scene by scene, and despite a script that's almost Ionesco-like in its absurdity, he keeps the picture afloat, maintaining viewer interest for the full running length of nearly two hours. This is a tribute to Hartley's command of tone, which is much more assured than in his early films, and also to the skill of his actors in working within it, particularly Posey, Urbaniak and Jeff Goldblum. Moment by moment, Posey keeps it real and keeps it stylized, effortlessly inhabiting Hartley's skewed scheme, which she seems to understand on an intuitive level. Her use of her face, simultaneously for comedy and pathos, is a marvel. To see her in Fay Grim -- her alert eyes, her flawless skin, her wit and radiant intelligence -- is to realize this is one of the most beautiful women working in cinema today. For my money, Hartley lets himself off too easy in the writing process and keeps having to make up for it in the filming. In middle age, he still has an immature artist's confidence in mere gestures and attitudes. I think he could be more rigorous and should aspire to more. Still, you won't see another film like Fay Grim this year, and we should give Hartley credit for making it work on his own terms. -- Advisory: Violence and strong language. ",1
"Flanders: Drama. Starring Samuel Boidin, Adélaïde Leroux and Henri Cretel. Directed by Bruno Dumont. (Not rated. 91 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) He shares some characteristics with his late countryman, the French master Robert Bresson, in that he works with amateur actors and encourages a certain emotional flatness in the speaking of dialogue. Like Bresson, Dumont is concerned with towering moral issues. But whereas Bresson viewed his characters with the lofty equanimity of a mystic, Dumont views his characters through a lens of moral disgust. Also unlike Bresson, he has no qualms about throwing in the occasional, jaw-dropping action sequence. Don't fight this movie. Just release and get onto its wavelength. One suggestion: Watch the action as though from another, higher species, as if observing human beings in their natural habitat. We meet Demester (Samuel Boidin) on his farm one morning. His girlfriend, Barbe (Adélaïde Leroux), the town trollop, shows up. They go for a walk and have the most mechanical, passionless sex imaginable. Later, Barbe has sex with Demester's friend Blondel (Henri Cretel), which causes Demester some consternation, but these people are too dead inside and too witless, and their lives are too unexamined, for the audience to care about their emotions. Dumont invites us to look at them as a phenomenon, as specimens of humanity, no more. Then comes the draft, and Demester and Blondel are sent to a Muslim country, where, lacking moral standards, and under the strain of seeing friends picked off by snipers, they drift into committing atrocities. It's the path of least resistance. Flanders depicts some heavy violence, including battle scenes, a rape and a fairly excruciating castration. In Dumont's view, war is not some misfortune that distorts moral nature so much as it's the ultimate expression of peoples' real moral nature, an opportunity for folks to express their true nihilism and hatred for everybody. Sex is animalistic; conversation is useless, and love is a travesty. Interpersonal connections are possible, but they're never complete. Lessons can be learned, and yet the whole truth eludes the characters. It's hard to say if Dumont is being elitist, suggesting that some people, perhaps the majority of people, are just too dumb for experience to truly touch them; or if he's being merely pessimistic, suggesting that human beings as a whole are disappointing and stupid. In any case, Dumont is hardly an upbeat guy, and Flanders isn't a laugh a minute -- or a laugh in 91 minutes. But if approached in a sober, receptive mood, the film will reveal its virtues, its novelty and its muted but distinct passion. -- Advisory: This film contains strong violence, sexual situations and simulated sex.

"Flannel Pajamas: Romantic drama. Starring Justin Kirk and Julianne Nicholson. Directed by Jeff Lipsky. (Not rated. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Curiously, the film seems to have no discernible point, and yet -- this is practically unique -- the absence of a point becomes, in itself, a form of narrative interest. Clearly, an inept person did not make the film. Clearly, it was made by a writer-director, Jeff Lipsky, who feels strongly about the material and who has the ability to create enough tension, scene after scene, to maintain an audience's interest. But what keeps us in our seats is trying to figure out what Lipsky is getting at. Why is he showing us these people? Is he slowly building to something without our noticing? Is a statement being made about relationships in general? Justin Kirk is Stuart and Julianne Nicholson is Nicole. He's a publicist, who specializes in fabricating interesting stories for his clients. She aspires to be a caterer. Over the course of a long conversation, they get to know each other. She's ingenuous, and he's a professional liar -- so the audience's guard is up concerning him. He's flashy but seems to lack authenticity. But then gradually he becomes more sincere, while she becomes sullen and disapproving. So, though the movie at first seems to be signaling that he's a bad guy, that card never turns over. Yet he's not so great, either, in that he does some lousy things, like trying to alienate her from her friends. But wait, she does some dreadful things, too. Structurally, Lipsky always seems to be setting Stuart up to be a villain, but things keep happening to awaken our sympathy. For example, her family is appalling to him. He's Jewish, and her mother is an unabashed anti-Semite. Over time, I found myself sympathizing more with Stuart, but others might sympathize with Nicole. Nothing's clear-cut. Actually, after seeing the film I spent a day wondering what Lipsky was up to, and I came up with a number of theories. The least interesting guess was that the film is autobiography, that the filmmaker is or was Stuart, and that that accounted for the uninflected nature of the storytelling. Well, it turns out that Lipsky, in all the press material, talks about how the film is based on his own marriage back in the early 1980s. See, this is why Bob Dylan doesn't talk about his songs: It makes them less interesting. Knowing its origins, Flannel Pajamas seems less like an adventurous experiment and more like a mea culpa that doesn't quite come off. Maybe Lipsky intended to make himself the heavy but couldn't resist making his wife look worse and demolishing his in-laws along the way. Being told that it's autobiography transforms a mind-bogglingly objective film into something else, a subjective film that doesn't add up. And yet -- the big and yet -- this is all quite fascinating. What's more, if this film were in subtitles, particularly if it were in French, we'd all be looking at it and saying, Incroyable. (Although, if it were French, the woman would have had more lines than the man. That would have helped.) As it stands, this is a rare romantic drama, one that puts two good actors through the wringer, and it's as much a pleasure to see them working as it is to watch Lipsky working things out. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language, simulated sex and full frontal nudity, male and female.

"Flawless: Drama. Starring Demi Moore and Michael Caine. Directed by Michael Radford. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Flawless tells a story about the flawless robbery of flawless diamonds, but there's something even more interesting about it than the caper aspect. That's the somber contemplation of the female executive at midcentury. In Flawless we see her, in her tight skirts, high necks and Butterfield 8 hair. She's a vision of rigorous precision, of chain-smoking as an expression of frustration, and of the lonely realization that even being perfect won't cut it in a man's world. And that she's incarnated by Demi Moore only increases the irony and the impact. This is an actress known for her freedom and irrepressibility - her Vanity Fair covers alone are landmarks of pop culture excess. To see Moore, in particular, boxed in and constrained by an era's conventions is in itself a comment on the era. It's 1960, and Moore plays Laura, a London diamond company executive whose bouffant keeps hitting the glass ceiling. Each time she's passed over for promotion, she works even harder, sitting at her desk, late at night, in an empty building, save for the guards and the friendly night janitor, played by Michael Caine. As Mr. Hobbs (Caine) putters and empties her trash, Laura keeps her eyes riveted to the papers on her desk. She is determined to smoke, smile and white-knuckle her way to success, even if it kills her. The turn comes when the janitor reveals himself not to be a harmless happy idiot, but Caine in his wily old sneak mode. This janitor has been keeping his eyes and ears open for a long, long time. He reveals to Laura some disturbing firsthand knowledge, namely that she is about to be fired, and he tries to enlist her in a plan to rob the company - just a tiny robbery that the company might not notice, but that would put them both on easy street for the rest of their lives. Flawless is a fictional tale, but something in director Michael Radford's conscientious, methodical presentation gives it the feeling of true history. Watching it is like watching a historical dramatization of something that never really happened. This treatment has a sobering effect on the movie, one that, on balance, is a good thing. The seeming truth of it invites speculation. How much, for example, is this vision of Moore as the quintessential female executive, circa 1960, equally fictional? Is she an accurate reflection of that era's reality or a fictional construction, made up of equal parts Liz Taylor and Tippi Hedren? I don't know the answer, but I enjoyed being confronted by the question. That it never seems at all far-fetched that Laura should get herself involved in Mr. Hobbs' little scheme is a testimony to Edward Anderson's screenplay. The story construction is neat, not at all flashy, but satisfying. But ultimately it's the world of Flawless that most recommends it, the mores, the unconscious sexism of the boardroom, the safe sallies that pass for seductive banter, the drinking, the smoking, the high hair, and the strange gulf that seems to separate men and women. It's a portrait of a lonely world that may or may not be 1960. Perhaps, it's our dream of 1960. Moore has always been an actress with a deep, intuitive intelligence, and it's a shame that the public's perception of her - and maybe her conception of herself - should have been sidetracked in the '90s by her publicity antics and cult-of-the-body posturing. What a decline from Mortal Thoughts and Ghost to Striptease and G.I. Jane - her filmography goes from great movies to mediocre movies to movies bordering on the neurotic. The good news is that Flawless represents, finally, a return to form, or maybe something even better, the beginning of a strong second act.  Actually, there's no reason the best isn't yet to come for Moore. She's a middle-aged powerhouse. She's Susan Hayward and Joan Crawford combined. She's an actress of turbulence and concentration who can swing for the fences. Let's hope she gets the chance. -- Advisory: Brief strong language.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"For those with an interest in Ernest Hemingway, “Papa Hemingway in Cuba” is a remarkable treat. It contains information about the writer heretofore unknown, and though it’s a dramatic feature and not a documentary, it claims to tell the truth, without embellishment. Even better, it was written by someone who saw the events depicted firsthand.The biggest kick of all is the performance of Adrian Sparks, who is as close to the actual Hemingway as you can ever hope to find. He looks just like him, but just as important, he sounds just like him. The voice of the real-life Hemingway was not the voice that comes off the pages of his novels. It was higher pitched than you might expect and very middle American. He didn’t sound like a stoic, tough-guy hero, but more approachable and normal — a voice you might hear coming out of a bank manager working in a small town in Illinois, circa 1940.Directed by Bob Yari, “Papa Hemingway” took 10 years to make, during which time the screenwriter, Denne Bart Petitclerc, died. Petticlerc’s name is changed to Ed Myers in this version, but Ed’s story is Petitclerc’s story. He was an abandoned child who grew up, bummed around and found his footing as a newspaper reporter. And he idolized Hemingway. In the late 1950s, while working in Miami, Myers (Giovanni Ribisi) writes to his hero in Cuba, and a few weeks later, he gets a phone call. It’s Hemingway, and he has three things to say: (1) He praises Myers’ style of “under-writing.” (2) He announces that he read Myers’ letter 10 times. (3) He wants to know if Myers likes to fish. Within days, Myers finds himself out on a boat getting taught how to fish by the man himself.Hemingway and his wife, Mary (Joely Richardson), call Myers “kid,” and he is invited to regard this older couple as family. Hemingway becomes a mentor and a father figure. We see his unexpected shyness and sensitivity, but also his mean streak. As Woody Allen once observed in a stand-up bit, Hemingway, sooner or later, punched almost every one of his friends in the face. It was just a matter of time.The Cuban revolution, which was brewing in these years, coincided with a difficult period in Hemingway’s life. He was an alcoholic and, according to modern-day psychologists, almost certainly had bipolar disorder. The latter is reinforced by Petitclerc’s recollections, which depict Hemingway as swinging wildly from high spirits to anger to suicidal depression. Sparks’ performance somehow takes all these divergent traits and blends them into a single, convincing portrait. His Hemingway is warm, sensitive, charismatic, brave, cruel and nasty, by turns a boring old drunk and the most fascinating man in the world. As Mary, Richardson has less of a role, but she is also a complex figure, sometimes the long-suffering wife and at other times a partner in dysfunction. The occasional toxicity of the Hemingway marriage is presented with all the clarity of something remembered through the appalled eyes of youth. There are few things more baffling, dispiriting or surprising when young than witnessing the self-defeating stupidity of one’s elders.Ribisi is an ideal audience surrogate, full of feeling, though in a contained, Hemingwayesque way. “Papa Hemingway in Cuba” is a relationship story, but it’s even more the biography of a great man in decline, and about the pressures he faced in his last years — physical and mental illness, harassment by the FBI and a revolution right outside his doorstep.Speaking of his doorstep, the house and the grounds that you see in “Papa Hemingway in Cuba” are not a re-creation. All the scenes in Hemingway’s house were filmed in his actual house, which is now the Museo Hemingway in Havana.",1
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall: Comedy. Starring Jason Segel, Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis. Directed by Nicholas Stoller. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)  Jason Segel did the best favor an actor can do for himself: He wrote a funny screenplay with an ideal role for you-know-who, and then he got really lucky on the timing. Segel's breakthrough movie, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, deserves to ride the wave of the latest, hottest micro-trend in pictures: the romantic comedy for guys. This is what Judd Apatow, who produced Sarah Marshall, has brought to movies in the past few years: 40-Year-Old Virgin? For guys. Knocked Up? Face it: It was a guy movie. So was Superbad. These movies take a genre usually pitched to a female audience but then add sex, a touch of gross-out humor and - most important - a healthy dose of male vulnerability. Like its predecessors, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a smart comedy that trades on social embarrassment and shows love from the standpoint of male insecurity.  It cuts uncomfortably close to real life. That's what makes it funny. After all, behind the placid facade of most men, there's usually a Sarah Marshall, who witnessed the pathetic breakup scene, the regrettable episode of weeping or some other self-inflicted emasculation. Our hero's girlfriend dumps him in the first scene of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and his misery and heartache, while comically extreme, is not far removed from the real thing. Segel is like the Ghost of Breakups Past, and the only response, for anyone who has ever been there, is to recognize that state, squirm a little and then crack up laughing.  But will women find this equally amusing? That's the question. Peter (Segel) is a musician, with a respectable job as the composer for a TV show, but he's become complacent and, when he's not working, he's parked in front of the TV set, like some Platonic ideal of a guy about to get dumped. His girlfriend, Sarah (Kristen Bell), is a famous TV actress, the star of the show, and the moment of their breakup gives us one of the great comic tableaus of 2008: She's impeccably dressed, and he happens to be nude. (It's the middle of the day, and he's not yet dressed.) Within a minute, he looks like a sobbing, quivering white whale, a blubbering heap of blubber.  That tableau comes pretty close to the familiar nightmare of going out in public without wearing clothes, and that's how deep the embarrassment cuts in this movie - to the most basic, core humiliations possible. Most of Forgetting Sarah Marshall takes place in Hawaii, where the humiliations continue. Peter goes there to forget, only to find that Sarah is at the same hotel, with her new boyfriend - an English rock star, of course. Segel's previous work has been confined to small roles in movies, in which I never noticed him, and to better roles on TV shows that I've never seen, but he has a quality in this film characteristic of a lot of actors who've gone on to major success: He seems familiar already, as if he's always been there. In addition, he shows expert timing in this film, as well as a willingness to put himself on the line, emotionally and physically.  Kristen Bell does as much as she can with the somewhat thankless role as Sarah, and Mila Kunis is winning as the radiantly reasonable hotel clerk who takes pity on poor Peter. Two members of the Apatow stock company appear in smaller roles, Paul Rudd as a mentally burnt-out surf instructor and Jonah Hill as the hotel waiter. The movie's major surprise is Russell Brand as Aldous, the rock star. Instead of a comic abstraction, Aldous is presented with some complexity and sympathy, and he's played to comic perfection by Brand, who's a welcome discovery. If there's anything bad to be said about Forgetting Sarah Marshall, it's nothing about the movie itself but rather about the notion of male-oriented romantic comedies in general. The fact that Aldous is presented with more depth than any of the women is symptomatic. Right now in America, all the active genres cater to a male audience: action, sci-fi, adventure, crime, etc. If romantic comedy goes that way, too, our actresses may have to emigrate to Europe to find a decent role.-- Advisory: Sex talk, sexual situations and male frontal nudity.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate. com/podcasts.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Freedomland: Drama. Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Julianne Moore and Edie Falco. Directed by Joe Roth. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Backed by a good script by Richard Price, she instead gives us idiocy as we encounter it in life, in its impure, adulterated state. She plays a woman who has been a loser from the get-go, the black sheep of her family, a former drug user, someone without the will or capacity to make her life add up to anything more than a big fat zero. Yet she's not without the ability to reach back for the unexpected five-dollar word or the stray hint of an insight. Her body language is compressed, stiff and graceless. She releases quickly into anger because anger creates the physical sensation of power, even as it reveals frustration and powerlessness. Moore's meticulous character work, as well as a less flashy but rock-solid performance by Samuel L. Jackson as a popular police detective, carries Freedomland across the finish line when it starts limping and dragging after its first hour. Based on Price's best-selling crime novel of the same name, the picture gets off to a great start, setting in motion a riveting crime story while bringing the audience into a vivid and sordid world of complicated alliances and racial tensions. Jackson plays Lorenzo, a police detective known as Big Daddy around a New Jersey housing project, where he reigns as a kind of benevolent dictator. One night he gets a call that a white woman named Brenda (Moore) has been injured in a carjacking near the projects, and when he goes to the hospital he discovers something else from the hysterical woman: Her 4-year-old son was sleeping in the back seat of the car. From this set-up, Price and director Joe Roth are able to build a suspenseful and thoroughly satisfying first hour. Because Brenda's brother (Ron Eldard) is a cop in a white suburb the next town over, the suburban police descend on the projects, even though they technically don't have jurisdiction. Not to be outdone, the local police also descend en masse and start giving the residents the third degree. Lorenzo's challenge is to find the child, dead or alive, before tensions ignite into a riot. The movie starts drifting when the filmmakers begin looking for deeper significance in the story. Is this a film about racial discord, middle-aged redemption or the vulnerability of the most innocent? In a sense, Freedomland is about all these things, in that it raises questions and glances off them, but there's no concentrated pursuit of any idea or set of ideas, and in the end the film seems more like a concoction than a thesis -- a series of elements slapped together without reason, only because it seemed interesting at the time. When Freedomland was speeding along, in the beginning, this was hard to notice. But when it slows down and becomes thoughtful, the lack of an overall point is unmistakable. This would seem to be a bigger problem than it becomes. What saves Freedomland are the individual scenes and the interplay of people. I get the feeling that this is what Price is most interested in, and that everything else is just an elaborate mechanism to bring about a series of charged and revealing human encounters. Edie Falco plays a housewife who heads a group of concerned mothers who look for missing children. In a remarkably shrewd bit of writing, Price gives us a scene between Falco and Moore in which Falco tells Brenda a long story about her own child's abduction. Roth wisely keeps the camera on Falco, in close-up, with Moore's profile in the foreground, as Falco segues seamlessly and gently into pointed questions about Brenda's child's kidnapping. That's a scene to replay again and again: Beautiful writing meets brilliant acting meets smart direction. At the finish, the filmmakers give us at least three different endings, probably because they have no idea what Freedomland is saying, probably because it's not saying much of anything. But a film with this many virtues can't be written off as just another average entry. -- Advisory: This movie contains strong language and some violence. ",1
"Friday Night Lights: Drama. Starring Billy Bob Thornton, Lucas Black and Derek Luke. Directed by Peter Berg. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Other sports movies do little but try to make the audience root for the team. Friday Night Lights accomplishes that almost in passing. Its real triumph is in the way it allows us to watch the action from a discerning and more rewarding distance. What we see is something sad and human, bestial and ridiculous, pathetic and grand. People who like sports movies will love Friday Night Lights, but so will people who don't like sports movies and would never think of seeing a high school football game. It's more about sociology than championships. Director Peter Berg, who as an actor was best known for starring opposite Linda Fiorentino in The Last Seduction, does everything he can to keep the audience at an alert and watchful remove. Though set in the '80s, Friday Night Lights could not be confused for an '80s film -- the technique is too obviously modern. Berg goes in for quick cuts, hand-held shots and fast, smeary pans. It's a risky approach, but it succeeds here because it's guided by a point of view. Berg is presenting a world he wants us to see as something apart from our own and fixed in an earlier time. The intention is not to give us the actual event but snippets of the event, as they might exist in memory. In keeping with that intention, Friday Night Lights is shot on a film stock that exaggerates contrasts while washing out colors. It really does look like a memory. The memory effect is further aided by period details, which movies usually forget altogether when presenting fairly recent history. True to its time period, the film has every woman sporting '80s-style big hair. In fact, in retrospect, that big hair looks pretty good. So does Billy Bob Thornton, who, as time goes on, is developing an uncanny resemblance to the young Jimmy Carter. Here he plays coach Gary Gaines, a man who combines a fierce determination to win with an odd equanimity of spirit. That's an unusual combination but a natural for Thornton, who can seem high-strung and mellow almost simultaneously. The 1988 season finds the coach with a team that's talented but small, a liability he hopes to overcome through speed. At the center of his strategy is a runner named Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), a cocky kid who seems destined for big things. But when Boobie is injured early on, the plans have to be redrawn. Boobie's story becomes one not of triumph, but of the agony of being on the outside looking in. Though Berg and the other screenwriters (Buzz Bissinger and David Aaron Cohen) make us care about who wins, we never care as much as the characters do. Thus, we're able to see that the importance of high school football in this town's life is simply outsized. Nothing is more important than football. As far as everyone in the movie (except the coach) is concerned, life is one long, miserable slog, interrupted only by a brief season under the lights. The kids feel the pressure to make the memories they'll take through life and to provide vicarious satisfaction for a lot of bored, unhappy adults. It's not a healthy arrangement. You don't understand, says country music star Tim McGraw, who plays Billingsley, the abusive father of one of the boys. This is the only thing you're ever gonna have. And, of course it is, if your whole idea of success is so circumscribed as to see high school glory as the greatest thing to aspire to. Friday Night Lights beautifully conveys that limitation of vision. When the coach drives home, he listens to himself being criticized on local call-in radio. In a parking lot, two older townspeople imply that he'll be fired if we don't win. Can't these people get a life? Though as adults they're expected to remember their year on the team as ecstatic, the players mostly look miserable, coping with all kinds of stresses, from within and without. Tension is the base note of Lucas Black's performance as the quarterback, and anguish is that of Garrett Hedlund's performance as young Billingsley. Less about sports, this is a compelling movie about kids being enlisted into a town's mass neurosis. Advisory: Some sexual activity and strong language. ",1
"Full Grown Men: Comedy-drama. Starring Matt McGrath and Judah Friedlander. Directed by David Munro. (Not rated. 78 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) The first thing to notice about Full Grown Men is the distinct glow of its world. The setting is suburban, and yet everything is as vivid and bright as a child might experience it. The clouds are bright white. The sky is a rich blue. Everything is in focus, and everything is beautiful.  Yet something is wrong. There's something creepy and frozen about these images, something regressive and empty. Before we're five minutes into the story, before the story is even launched, director David Munro has given us the mood and hinted at his message through images. Full Grown Men is an artistically integrated film that introduces a refreshing new talent to the independent scene, one who combines the visual palette of filmmaker Harmony Korine with an all-important sense of narrative.  At the movie's center is Alby, a no-longer-young man with lank, center-parted hair, who has grown too large for his swaddled psychic state. He has a sentimental attachment to his childhood because he wants to remain a child. And so, fleeing adult responsibility, he goes on a road trip in search of his childhood. His goal is to go backward, and the challenge for Munro, a San Franciscan who co-wrote the screenplay with wife Xandra Castleton, is to grow this character - to provide forward motion despite his protagonist's resistance.  Perhaps the key to the film's success is that Munro is sympathetic to Alby without being taken in by him, so he is able to show Alby's dilemma with some distance and perspective. The film benefits further from the fact that almost everyone knows someone like Alby. Even as he threatens to drive us crazy with his dreamy, drifty nature and the underlying selfishness this brand of sensitive self-absorption involves, we understand what he's going through.  Men who'd rather be boys are usually presented as loving and delightful souls, and the analysis goes no deeper. But Matt McGrath gives a delicate, complicated performance that renders the character in psychologically rich terms. Alby is a car crash in slow motion. The flying splinters of his impact with reality are the shards of vintage toys - and he holds onto them like talismans from a safe time. As he travels, he encounters other characters lost in their own dreamscapes, such as Deborah Harry as a former professional mermaid, living in her tank-like camper. Here's a rare example of a movie in which the cameos are an integral part of the film. There's a riveting appearance by Alan Cumming, playing a hitchhiker from hell, and a wonderful bit from Amy Sedaris, whose one scene is the comic highlight of the movie. She plays a waitress who segues from romantic interest in Alby to complete hostility when she realizes he's broke. Hers is a terrific example of comic acting, in which it's possible to trace the precise development of the character's thought on her face. Of course, Alby is in a losing game with time. We know that from the first minutes. But Full Grown Men has a lot more to say than that some people really ought to grow up. Beneath its placid, candy-colored surface, it has a psychological sophistication, a nuanced understanding of the mistakes that allow people to get locked into an earlier time - which is really the same as getting locked into a version of themselves.  In the lovely and unexpected terms of this odd, original and concise film, Alby is able to enter the stream of real emotion only when he turns away from a rarefied focus on his own experience. Full Grown Men, a poignant, quirky and effective alternative to the usual soulless, computer-generated summer fare, is well worth a look. -- Advisory: Adult situations.",1
"Funny and disturbing in the best way, the comedy-drama “Austin Found” captures something beyond its story of a woman’s obsession with making her little daughter a beauty pageant winner. It details one specific pathology that, in the process, illuminates a general sickness, a spiritual vacuum in which the desire for fame and admiration replaces every other human value. The tone is arch and satirical, but it’s also serious, a mix that’s exactly right for a movie saying two true things simultaneously: This is awful. This is absurd. A few generations ago, audiences would have dismissed a story like this as nonsensical, as too far-fetched to be believed. But we totally get it, which probably isn’t a good thing.Linda Cardellini — wow, is she good here: scary, weirdly sympathetic, pathetic, powerful — is Leanne, a Texas wife and mother whose dream is to turn her daughter into a tiny beauty queen. The daughter complies, but reluctantly. She’s a studious type with a gift for the violin, but her mother fills her days with jazz dancing lessons. “Fiddle players” apparently never win beauty pageants.Slowly, organically, Leanne’s backstory is revealed, that she was a high school mean girl and a beauty pageant contestant, with what looked like a glorious future ahead of her. She married a man who she thought had money, but the money dried up. As the movie starts, she finds herself desperate to pay for her daughter’s dancing lessons, but the credit cards are maxed out. That’s when she gets her million-dollar idea, to have her daughter kidnapped, figuring that the inevitable publicity will catapult them to book deals and fame.The brilliance of “Austin Found” and of Cardellini’s performance is they don’t send up the skewed values that Leanne embodies. It would have been so easy, for example, to make the child beauty pageant into a grotesque lampoon and to make everyone connected with it ridiculous. But writer-director Will Raee and co-writer Brenna Graziano are not about dismissing Leanne or laughing at her. They’re about getting inside her mind and illuminating that sort of mentality.Cardellini plays Leanne as a person of drive and force, who has been made dangerous through defects both in her character and in the world she grew up in. Just as she tells her daughter to act like an 11-year-old Marilyn Monroe, someone told Leanne that, too — perhaps an entire culture told her this. She is enslaved to a fantasy about what constitutes happiness and self-actualization, and it all has something to do with the admiration or envy of strangers. If she were younger, she’d be taking pictures of herself and posting them online every 10 minutes. Same illness, different manifestation.What Leanne experiences as warmth of feeling is a sentimental solipsism that puts her outside the reach of reason. She is absolutely sure and absolutely wrong, and following her down that path — as the movie gets darker; still funny, but edgier and more alarming — is fascinating. Of equal interest, in a less flashy way, is the moral journey of Leanne’s daughter, Patricia, played by Ursula Parker with an attuned sense of a little girl’s emerging awareness.",1
"Funny how there are fans of Jennifer Lawrence who will never see her in “Serena.” It’s not her best film, but it contains one of her best performances, in a role that challenges her more than any other. The movie is set in 1927, but director Susanne Bier seems to have decided that an early 1930s look might be more flattering to the eye, and she’s right. Lawrence was only 22 when “Serena” was filmed in 2012, but to see her here, in the styles of the great actresses of that earlier era — people, like Greta Garbo and Constance Bennett, who were also in their early 20s during their success — is to be invited to see Lawrence as a star in that class. It’s to get an idea how she might have fared if she worked in an era that valued women and emotions, not just men and action movies. She would have fared quite well.In “Serena,” we get to see her in a new way, as if for the first time. Her look is lovely but odd, with a lopsided mouth that doesn’t seem to go with the rest of her porcelain face. The mouth rescues her from pedestrian prettiness and gives her that hint of discord without which real beauty is hardly possible. It makes her right for roles that call for someone driven and eccentric — in other words, ideal for the title role in “Serena.”In a story based on the novel by Ron Rash, Lawrence plays a woman of charm and confidence who has been scarred by a horrible, transformative childhood trauma. When we meet Serena, she is in the middle of her journey, with her past behind her, but Lawrence is certainly aware of the character’s past and has harmonized it into the flow of her personality. She looks golden, yet dark. As the new wife of a lumber baron (Bradley Cooper), she projects a steely facade, but deep in her eyes there’s a hint of something panicked. They start out as two young people with a dream, with no intention of becoming the Macbeths of the North Carolina timber business. But the pressures around them are fierce, particularly from proto-environmentalists who want to have the forests declared a national park. Susanne Bier (“After the Wedding”) is one of the best actor’s directors around, and working with her, Lawrence constructs a well-considered and thought-out performance that makes sense of the character’s extremes. At times, you can feel Bier relishing what this actress is capable of, as when she films Lawrence in close-up, reacting to bad news in one unbroken take. Her face is still, then she starts to cry, and then her face gives way to sobbing. Very few people are capable of doing this with a camera 2 feet from their face. Even fewer could make you want to watch. As the hotshot who marries Serena, Cooper provides a generous sounding board for Lawrence’s star performance. Basically, his job is to enact the businessman’s growing realization that his wife is stronger yet weaker and fiercer and stranger and braver and crazier than he’ll ever be. Though he is in Lawrence’s shadow, Cooper does good work, and it’s nice that he did it. Even with a strong director keeping things in balance, Lawrence might have made a lesser co-star disappear.",1
"GEORGE WASHINGTON: Romance. Starring Donald Holden, Candace Evanofski and Curtis Cotton III. Directed by David Gordon Green. (Not rated. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) George Washington is not like any other movie. That, in itself, makes it something to see. Writer-director David Gordon Green, in his feature debut, has created a visually and emotionally consistent universe. From the shots of the landscape to the impulses of the characters, everything about it is muted and yet vivid. George Washington isn't in it. The picture is about young adolescents living in an unspecified rural Southern town, in a recent but nonspecific period of history. Young George (Donald Holden), whose last name is Richardson, is a 13-year-old boy with a congenitally (and metaphorically) soft skull. He can't get his head wet and needs to wear a helmet some of the time. Absolutely nothing happens in the first 25 minutes, except scenes of various kids sitting around talking. Young George gets a new girlfriend when 12-year-old Nasia (Candace Evanofski) breaks up with gentle, bespectacled Buddy (Curtis Cotton III). Buddy is not enough of a man for her. That this should be of interest to anyone watching is baffling, and yet it is. A lot of young filmmakers dare to be dull. Green goes the extra step. If dullness were a speeding train, Green ties his movie to the tracks and says, Come and get me. Yet George Washington holds the viewer in its gentle grip, if only because the scenes feel so true and authentic -- and different. The kids, all of them nonprofessionals, are neither precocious nor cute, like the usual kids in movies. They are matter-of-fact, talking as equals to each other and not preening for an unseen movie audience of adults. Candace Evanofski is particularly self-possessed as Nasia, who narrates the story in voice-over. Her intentionally affectless narration is what first informs us that George aspires to heroism, that he dreams of saving lives and of living forever. Green gets to have it both ways: Though Nasia believes in George's destiny, her bland tone makes us doubt his future and even worry about him. Green's pace is measured. Shots are long and compositions are painterlike. George Washington is set in an impoverished world. Houses are little more than shacks. Businesses are abandoned, and the town square is nondescript and bleak. Nothing is pretty, and yet nothing is ugly, because Green's pace allows a sense of wonder to creep in. Any environment, seen through the eyes of childhood, has a shimmer of possibility. There's a death early in George Washington. Kids are playing in an abandoned amusement park, and one of them is fatally injured. Gushing blood, the child takes a stick and bangs it hard on a bathroom stall, over and over, before collapsing. That steady pounding is the extra touch that turns prose into poetry. The film is not plot-driven. The death of the child is not an important story turn so much as it's an organizing event. The children take in the death, talk about it and go on to different lives as a result. Damien Jewan Lee is impressive as Vernon, an older teenager who covers up the death and then is racked with guilt. His partner in crime is Sonya (Rachael Handy), one of the few white children in the film, who is more cold-blooded. George's growing obsession with heroism dominates the last two-thirds of George Washington. All I know is I want to be the strongest man in the world, sometimes. His idea of being a hero is naive, talking about wanting to save lives, while a blown-up photo of former President Bush hangs on the wall. Only near the end does Green seem to be spinning his wheels. Here and there an exchange of dialogue will feel forced, and the picture doesn't really end; it just stops. Yet these failings only remind us for just how long Green is able to sustain his mood and hit the right notes. His movie is hardly perfect or fully successful, but it's strange and strangely beautiful -- a unique work of art. Advisory: This film contains violence. ",1
"German writer-director Tom Tykwer, who collaborated with her on the international hit Run, Lola, Run, once again finds opportunities for Potente to work her magic. Simple scenes become full-bodied emotional journeys, for no reason but this actress' power in a close-up. Tykwer is smart enough to know where to put the camera -- about six inches from Potente's amazing face. Yet Tykwer also leans on Potente too heavily, expecting her to give meaning to voids in the screenplay -- voids that turn into black holes in the film's last hour. That's asking too much. Certainly, without Potente or an actress of her caliber, The Princess and the Warrior would have been a dreary and self- indulgent exercise. As it stands, it's dreary and self-indulgent but has its crystalline moments. Potente plays a nurse in a mental hospital who, one afternoon, gets hit by a truck. She is choking on her own tongue when a scruffy young criminal (Benno Furmann) saves her life by performing a makeshift tracheotomy and inserting a plastic straw as a breathing tube. It's an intense scene. After her recovery, the nurse seeks out this mystery man, and although her search is gripping, once she finds him the movie turns coy. The characters have nothing to say to each other -- that is, Tykwer has nothing for them to say. Yet the audience is expected to see something important in the mystic bond between this innocent nurse and this angry young criminal. Some viewers might, but they'll have to force themselves. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Pegah Ahangarani. Directed by Rassul Sadr Ameli. (Not rated. 90 minutes. In Farsi with English subtitles.) It does not present an idealized world of innocent children and eccentric, benevolent adults. Rather, we come away with a sense of Iran as a harsh place, with a pervasive government and a real-live criminal underworld. We begin with a teenage boy and girl walking down the street, talking about their hopes for the future. Next thing, they're arrested -- for the crime of underage talking, presumably. Disgraced, the girl decides to run away from home. From there, she meets a lot of people, not all of whom are nice. It would seem the filmmaker is on the girl's side. She is the one who has dreams. She is the victim of an oppressive society. Yet, according to the film's publicity, filmmaker Rassul Sadr Ameli says he made the movie to deal with the subjective preoccupations of a number of the young people in our society. I sincerely hope their number, which is already considerable, will not increase. Is he serious? Or is he just saying that to make his film congenial to the Iranian government? Since we still don't know what Shostakovich was thinking about, we should probably give up hope of unraveling this mystery and just enjoy The Girl in the Sneakers for what it is: a bit of brightness in an impenetrable night. -- Mick LaSalle FAST FOOD FAST WOMEN: Romantic comedy. Starring Anna Thomson, Jamie Harris and Louise Lasser. Directed by Amos Kollek. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Sometimes it takes only about two minutes to know the bad news. Such is the case with Fast Food Fast Women, which has a vacant, inept, why-oh-why feeling from its opening minutes and only gets worse. The story, of a ditzy New York waitress on the threshold of her 35th birthday, was written and directed by Amos Kollek, in a style reminiscent of French director Eric Rohmer. It deals with the romantic longings and complications in the lives of several characters who either work or hang out in a diner. The characters discuss their feelings about love and romance and grope, as it were, for answers. The difference between Rohmer's characters and Kollek's is that Rohmer's are usually expert self-observers, intelligent and articulate, and Rohmer is interested in their ruminations. The characters in Fast Food, by contrast, are inarticulate and clueless, and Kollek is not interested in the fruits of their navel-gazing but in the phenomenon of it. The result is an approach that inevitably seems condescending: The treatment is fey, and the characters are presented as cute. They're not cute. And Bella, the waitress (Anna Thomson) is ridiculous, a former stock analyst who made $40,000 in six weeks but decided that she'd much rather work in a diner. Not even in a hotel restaurant, but a corner joint. She is pathetic, and her flailing attempts at love (with a cabdriver played by Jamie Harris) seem phony. Louise Lasser, meanwhile, plays a 60-year-old woman rediscovering romance with an older gentleman, in a plotline that's handled with the usual sentimentality. -- Mick LaSalle IMAX sports documentary. Directed by Jon Long. (Not rated. 40 minutes. At the Metreon.) Extreme, a celebration of adventure-sports athletes, opens at the IMAX screen at Metreon, and it's one of the best uses of the giant-screen format to date. Canadian filmmaker Jon Long captures exhilarating images of ice climbers, rock climbers, surfers, skiers and snowboarders -- and underlines the visuals with a strong music score and commentary by the athletes. The addiction to adrenaline is what gets most people hooked on extreme sports, says Craig Kelly. Almost without exception, the practitioners speak of the spiritual rewards in confronting nature at extreme levels -- the thrill of achieving harmony with the environment. Anyone who's seen an IMAX film at Metreon knows about the 80-foot-tall, 100-foot-wide screen and the amazing sound emerging from 44 speakers. Extreme maximizes the emotional impact of IMAX by taking us up close to view the athletes and their technique, and then pulling back to see them in relationship to the physical world. The images are unusually rich, dense and crystal clear. We can see the athletes at work, but we have to wonder how Long and his crew captured these images. In the closing credits, he gives us a peek, showing cranes, helicopters and camera operators who hang from slings that glide along cables strung between two mountains. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"Gloomy Sunday: Drama. Starring Erika Marozsan, Joachim Krol, Stefano Dionisi and Ben Becker. Directed by Rolf Schubel. (R. 114 minutes. In German with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) It takes its title from a popular 1930s song that was written in Hungary and recorded by artists throughout the world, including Billie Holiday. It's a song about grief and suicide, and the movie contains some of that, to be sure. But it opens under fairly happy circumstances, in a Budapest restaurant, circa 1940. Laszlo (Joachim Krol) owns the place, and his astonishingly beautiful lover, Ilona (Erika Marozsan) runs it. Why is she with this average-looking fellow, we immediately wonder. Soon we understand and appreciate Laszlo's energy. He's lively, attentive and thoroughly confident, and he's the kind of person who makes things happen. He is the opposite of the restaurant's handsome pianist, Andras (Stefano Dionisi), who is gifted and poetic but useless when it comes to worldly things. Ilona falls in love with both men, and Laszlo, figuring a part of Ilona is better than nothing, proposes a ménage à trois. It's the movie's fictional conceit that the song, Gloomy Sunday, a constant presence in the film, is a composition by Andras, and that people come from all over Europe to hear him play the tune in Laszlo's restaurant. The movie follows history in that the song inspires a rash of suicides -- apparently it became fashionable to kill oneself with Gloomy Sunday on the Victrola. But then, here as in history, the Nazis roll in and life seems more precious, and suicide redundant. As Ilona, Marozsan has every man in the film in love with her, and that's easy to believe. Her beauty suggests a depth and intelligence that could easily drive men to extremes -- but would more likely inspire them to be better people. Perhaps that is the key to the film's odd fascination. The characters, though in the absolute grip of passion, always seem to be struggling to maintain their better natures. We come to care about them. To a large extent, that's even true of Hans, a young German who becomes lovesick at the sight of Ilona during his first trip to Budapest -- and then returns three years later as a Nazi colonel, the city's head honcho. Weak and unloved, his behavior is erratic. He's a slave to his moods, with no external check on his power, and yet he protects Laszlo, a Jew, from being sent to a concentration camp. Gloomy Sunday has a loose structure, which is particularly welcome after a steady diet of American films, whose endings are guaranteed from the first five minutes. Watching Gloomy Sunday, one believes that it really might go anywhere, and that anywhere it goes will be interesting. Throughout, the film provides a steady string of dramatic situations and encounters, most of them taking place within the restaurant's four walls -- a place of decorum and civility that can't quite contain the fact or deny the reality that love and war are combustible. We watch, knowing that at any moment, either one might take the roof right off. Advisory: This film contains nudity and mild violence. ",1
"Go into any supermarket, and there's Britney, smiling from the cover of at least two magazines. Adults might forget her between TV commercials, but she has been, for years, whispering nonstop into preteen and pubescent ears. Crossroads is a chance to eavesdrop on what she's been saying. She plays Lucy, a virginal high school valedictorian who loves to sing. Her father (Dan Aykroyd) wants her to become a doctor, but she's conflicted. She feels she's just not a doctor, and not yet a singer, either. There has always been a disconnect between Spears' offstage and onstage personae. When not singing, she cultivates the image of a scantily clad but chaste young lady. But onstage she acts like every sailor's pal when the fleet's in. At a pop concert, this disparity can work. Music blurs edges, elevates personality and pushes everything into the dimension of fantasy. But a movie makes everything literal. So in Crossroads we home in on a wholesome young thing, then see her bumping, grinding and groaning as though in a state of arousal. What is this about? Lucy and two of her old friends hook up with a young man and drive cross- country to Hollywood. Their driver (Anson Mount) has a prison record for violating the Mann Act. So now he's taking three underage girls over multiple state lines. Give the man credit. He finds a crime he likes, and he sticks with it. Throughout Crossroads, director Tamra Davis finds ways to show Spears off. She appears in her underwear twice in the first 15 minutes and carts out her trademark zany look -- eyes crossed, tongue out. She sings I Love Rock and Roll in a karaoke bar and never stops giving us renditions of I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman, which is the worst kind of bad song. Bad and catchy. In the end, Crossroads is a lot like Spears herself. It cultivates not the illusion of wholesomeness, since no one's buying it, but the pretense of it. Yet examine the movie's message, and it's pretty insidious. We see Britney taking off on a cross-country trip without her father's permission, hanging up on Dad when he tells her to come home, and sharing her bed with an ex-con, who looks as if he's 30. And the movie doesn't present this as naughty or even adventurous. Rather, it presents this as the behavior of a nice girl who's a little on the nerdy, conservative side. If this is a nice girl, this is not good news, though not yet a disaster. Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and coarse language. -- Mick LaSalle . The members of the comedy troupe Broken Lizard are frat guys who've matured, but only slightly. Their comedy Super Troopers is more sophisticated than, say, American Pie 2, but they've still got the good sense to know you can't have a romp without a little raunch. The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen. That's right, Super Troopers makes those officers in the mustaches and aviator shades -- the ones who pull you over and say, Did you know how fast you were going? as if you didn't -- into comic and even sympathetic characters. Broken Lizard founder Jay Chandrasekhar, the movie's director, plays the lead patrolman with the reassuring comic presence of Ray Romano. He's the most levelheaded of the Vermont state troopers, who toy with stoned teenagers and play dumb word games to ease their boredom. What little plot exists concerns the troopers' rivalry with local police encroaching on their strip of highway. The first part of the picture is so tame that you wonder about the R rating, with innocent tomfoolery like a rookie trooper being doused with whipped cream. Then the sexual high jinks begin. A running gag involves a German couple in a hot Porsche who show there's more than one way to be fast. There's also a bit about bestiality that's beautifully done -- and bestiality is hard to do well. Mostly, Super Troopers is plain goofy. When a trooper joins a local policewoman on a drug case, he says, We can be like Cagney and Lacey. When she points out that those were two women, he says, OK, I'll be Lacey. Brian Cox, the great Scottish actor, revels in the role of the chief, who knows when to reprimand his charges and when to join them in an old-fashioned, sirens-blaring drunk. Super Troopers miscalculates with jokes about Afghanistan and the Taliban. Since the movie played Sundance more than a year ago, the references obviously predate Sept. 11, which also means there was plenty of time to edit them out. . This film contains raw language, drug and sexual humor. -- Carla Meyer . Peter Pan is still a Lost Boy. Captain Hook still wants his hide. And Wendy Darling is grown up with two kids of her own. Return to Never Land, the Walt Disney Pictures sequel to Peter Pan, picks up the threads of the 1953 Disney animated feature -- based on the James M. Barrie classic -- and jumps forward to World War II, when Wendy and family are living through bombings, blackouts and evacuations. Her son Daniel, roughly 5, is adorable and frisky. Daughter Jane, about 12, is a gloomy spoilsport who dismisses her mother's tales of Peter Pan and Tinker Bell as childish nonsense. Only when she's kidnapped by Captain Hook and taken to Never Land does Jane learn the power of faith and enchantment. This is pleasant, safe entertainment that ought to appeal to kids younger than 10, especially to girls, with its female-empowerment fantasy. It's got a good heart and a buoyant spirit, familiar characters and a nice message about keeping one's heart open to experience and magic. Compared with such computer-animated features as Toy Story, Shrek and Monsters, Inc. however, Return to Never Land seems dated and ordinary. The standard for animation was raised significantly by those recent films from Pixar and Pacific Data Images, in technical terms but also in humor, hipness and character definition. Going back to Never Land, then, feels a bit like taking a ride in an old, bumpy Studebaker. The plot is predictable and formulaic, the colors muted, the music forgettable and the action pokey. Since the focus is on skeptical Jane, the Peter character remains sketchy and undeveloped. Foppish Capt. Hook is played for laughs: crying Cast off, you mangy dogs with theatrical elan, then quivering like custard when a giant octopus occupies the deck of the Jolly Roger. For children, there's something irresistible in seeing a stern authority figure like Hook exposed and humiliated. What better fun than ripping off the big man's pants, literally in this case, and subverting his silly facade of control and superiority? Veteran voice actor Corey Burton doesn't have quite as much fun with the part as Hans Conreid did in the 1953 cartoon, or Australian actor Cyril Ritchard in the 1950s musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin. He doesn't quite pull off that absurd, campy pomposity. But with so little else to distract us in Return to Neverland, he's a blessing. -- Edward Guthmann . In Scotland, Pa., former actor and novice filmmaker Billy Morrissette transplants Macbeth to a 1970s burger joint populated by losers in their 30s who booze it up and race Camaros when not plotting coups. It all sounds way too cute, and sometimes it is. The film works more as a concept than as a collection of funny lines, and some comic premises bomb outright, like the three hippies standing in for the three witches. But Scotland, Pa. succeeds because of the cast's communal vibe of arrogant stupidity. Pat McBeth, the counter girl at Duncan's restaurant, is the sharpest tack among the mouth breathers. She's played by Maura Tierney, Morrissette's wife and the fine TV actress from ER and NewsRadio. Tierney has always been sexy in a sensible-shoes, matching-401(k) kind of way, but here she really lets loose. Her Lady Macbeth is a libidinous puppet master who prods her dullard fry cook husband, Mac (James LeGros), into murder so they can install a drive-through. Nobody said progress came without sacrifice. When Mac gets passed over for the manager's job, his wife sees red, and the restaurant owner lands in the deep fryer. You probably have some idea of what happens next: The McBeths turn the restaurant into a gleaming fast-food palace, but their respective psychoses and a detective named McDuff impede their rise to town pillars. Christopher Walken, a master at genial evil, makes McDuff as inscrutable as Tierney's Pat is transparent. When the scheming Pat flirts with the lawman, he appears to respond shyly. It's hard to tell who's scamming whom, but the smart money's on McDuff. LeGros slowly transforms his character from dunderhead to calculating killer, and he makes a good comic foil for Walken. As Mac's pal Banco, Kevin Corrigan wears his ugly guy glasses from Walking and Talking and reeks of squandered potential. The picture gets an enormous boost from music by '70s working-class heroes like Bad Company and Three Dog Night. The songs evoke a very specific era -- after Vietnam and before disco -- and move along but never overwhelm the story. Having a sensitive young football player intently listen to Janis Ian's At Seventeen near a poster from Cabaret says more than any dialogue ever could. Advisory: This film contains violence, raw language, sexuality. -- Carla Meyer . The Town Is Quiet is an audacious film, set in contemporary Marseille. Writer-director Robert Guediguian has created a strange mosaic of a plot, most of it surrounding a middle-aged woman with an unemployed alcoholic husband and a desperate junkie daughter. There isn't the usual story. Rather there are incidents occurring over a small period of time to a handful of characters. Only later, perhaps, does one realize that these events have one point of similarity: They are emblematic of some fundamental decay at the heart of urban life. Something isn't rotten in Marseille. Everything is rotten in Marseille. Ariane Ascaride plays Michele, who works every night in a fish market, only to come home to a miserable household, in which she has to listen to the bitter recriminations of her wastrel husband and care for her daughter's illegitimate infant. Anything bad that can happen in The Town Is Quiet happens. In one scene, Michele walks in to find the daughter (Julie-Marie Parmentier) turning tricks in the living room. Michele is appalled, but as her daughter's dependence on heroin becomes more acute, and the need for money more desperate, she herself decides to try prostitution. At 300 francs a pop, she starts seeing a hapless cabdriver. At times, Guediguian's film seems almost as if it's about to slide into utter absurdity. He keeps upping the stakes and piling on shocks until it borders on the ridiculous. Yet his strategy keeps him one step ahead of his audience throughout, and the shocks never quite seem gratuitous. Always, one gets the sense that this film is coming from some place real, and terrible. . Advisory: This film contains violence, nudity, sexual situations and harsh language. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Going in, everyone knows that “McFarland, USA” is intended to be heartwarming and inspirational. The filmmakers know you see them coming, and so they know they have only one play available to them — to come right at you. Kevin Costner plays a high school track coach, so right off we know there’s going to be the scene in which the quiet man stands up and makes a speech, telling the team how much he loves them. The film’s mission is to make you care about this coach, this family, this team, and this town; and “McFarland” does it. The surprise is that it does so methodically, expertly, never pushing you into feeling something unearned, and never making the soundtrack do the work.Go into this movie unwilling to be moved, and soon enough you’ll be tensing up and gritting your teeth and moving your head to nudge these kids across the finish line. Costner isn’t the whole picture, but he’s a big part of its success. He is one of a precious handful of current actors who has that thing that the studio-era stars had, of embodying a moral idea onscreen. With Costner in the cast, you don’t need the “USA” in the title, because the movie will automatically seem emblematic, an American story. It’s going to be about a stubborn and somewhat difficult guy, but one with fundamentally moral instincts, who rises above himself to do something good in the world.Forceful presenceAlong the way, people will tell him off. Notice this about Costner’s movies, including this one: People are always telling him off, and he invariably reacts in the same way. He says nothing. He just looks at them stone-faced but placid, as if thinking, “That may be true, that may be false, but I have nothing to say at this time.” It’s a way of showcasing his character’s strength even while pointing out his weaknesses. Based on a true story, “McFarland, USA” gives us the story of Jim White (Costner), who begins the film at a career low point. An outburst of temper has gotten him fired from a football coaching job, so he takes the only job he can get, as an assistant football coach at McFarland High in the San Joaquin Valley, in one of the poorest towns in California. He moves his family to a cracker-box house in a dicey neighborhood, and director Niki Caro wisely finds nothing cute in this. This man has fallen far and has taken his wife (Maria Bello) and kids with him.After a rocky start, Jim gets the idea to start a cross-country team, after noticing that the school has some particularly fast runners. With the backing of the principal, he finds seven kids for the team — including a chubby guy — and starts training them. He knows nothing about track, but he’s willing to put in the effort, including getting involved in the lives of his runners.Cultural viewMore than just another sports story, “McFarland, USA” is also an immersion into the culture of Mexican immigrants who work the land. Most people watching will be surprised to learn, for example, that these kids would get up at 4:30 in the morning and work the fields for hours, picking lettuce and cabbages, before going to school. In this world, Jim White — nicknamed “Blanco” by his students — can only be an outsider, until, in an important scene, both for his and for our understanding, he works the fields with them for one day. He comes home exhausted and nearly crippled. “McFarland, USA” could have been a sentimental film, but it’s not, because Caro and the screenwriters bothered to know what that they were talking about. They took care to be specific and show the ugliness and the difficulty of life in a harsh, poor immigrant town — for example, the store owner hosing off the blood in his driveway from the night before. Even good stories are never quite like a movie, and to its credit “McFarland, USA” doesn’t try hard to be like a movie. It tries to be something like life.",1
"Gone Baby Gone: Drama. Starring Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Amy Ryan. Directed by Ben Affleck. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.)Somewhere along the line a perception has arisen that Ben Affleck needs to do something to redeem himself. I'm not sure what exactly he did wrong or if it's a combination of things or just some lingering Gigli fallout, but if Gone Baby Gone doesn't make the case for Affleck as a genuine talent, nothing will.  In this, his first film as a director, he has had the good fortune to luck into a good story - a story so good that maybe anybody, working with a healthy budget and a team of professionals, could have turned out something decent. But budgets and stories and even a strong cast can't account for the uniform excellence of the performances in Gone Baby Gone. Even bit players are detailed and vivid. Scenes have emotional shape, and there's no doubting Affleck's feel for this world. As in Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title, the story is set in Boston and involves the abduction of a 4-year-old girl. Affleck grew up in Cambridge, Mass., and just the authenticity of the Boston accents here - not only the sounds, but the attitude and the spirit - grounds his movie in reality. But Affleck has not set out to depict Boston in general but a specific lowlife milieu. In the opening scene, an ostensibly distraught young mother talks to local TV cameras about her missing girl. The impulse is to sympathize with her, but it's impossible not to notice: This woman is dumb as a post. One might think playing dumb is easy, but actors usually end up commenting on the stupid characters they play, hinting to the audience of they're own intelligence while playing dumb. But Amy Ryan, who plays the mother, Helene, doesn't do that. She gives us the stupidity in pure form - plus, the sluttiness, the drunkenness, the cocaine addiction and the colossal vulgarity. Ryan plays a horror show, without once indicating some secret cause, blighted nobility or private shame. Helene is an idiot monster, and that's what Ryan presents, beautifully and brilliantly. Seeing her in these early scenes is the first indication of Affleck's sure hand with his actors. The second indication comes in an early scene in which Patrick (Casey Affleck), the private detective hired by the family to find the missing girl, is confronted by hostile goons in a sleazy bar. The scene is well written and suspenseful, but the revelation is Casey Affleck, who heretofore has been a rather wormy, uncharismatic screen presence. Every young actor should have a brother like Ben. In this scene, Casey Affleck suddenly commands the screen with an offbeat strength, and from that point on he holds the viewer's attention and respect.  As a director, Ben Affleck has a lot of story to cover, some of it labyrinthine, but his screenplay (which he co-wrote with Aaron Stockard) lays it all out methodically. The private detective and his girlfriend/partner (Michelle Monag- han) explore the seamy side of the case, working in an uneasy partnership with a veteran police detective (Ed Harris) and the head of the missing-person's unit (Morgan Freeman). Both Harris and Freeman let us feel the weight and the scars that come from years spent confronting irrationality, selfishness and evil. Imagine a career spent dealing every day with people like the one Ryan plays. Imagine what that would do to anybody's concept of humanity.  Gone Baby Gone deals in gray areas, in which stories that seem simple on the local news are more complicated upon reflection. Though at times a bit drawn out, the film is intelligent and always heading somewhere. And at one point it features something rare in American movies and not all that common in Europe - a conversation between two characters, who completely disagree, who are both sure they're right, in which the filmmaker doesn't tip his hand. Viewers may find themselves continuing that argument out into the parking lot.  -- Advisory: Strong language, lewd talk and violence.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Good Night, and Good Luck: Drama. Starring David Strathairn, George Clooney and Patricia Clarkson. Directed by George Clooney. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet in the midst of what is widely considered an exalted period in TV news history, undermining changes were taking place on the network level. The movie dramatizes that, too -- the beginnings of news as a money-making enterprise, as a ratings grabber, as a form of entertainment. Part drama and part civics lesson, Good Night, and Good Luck is an entertaining slice of American political and cultural history, enhanced by faithful period detail and energized by urgent parallels that George Clooney, as director and co-writer, wants to stress about the present day. The film is ambitious in intent, not in scope. The scenes take place almost entirely in either the TV studio, the CBS offices or the forlorn jazz club where the news staff unwinds. Murrow is at the center of the action -- played by David Strathairn, who looks and sounds just like Murrow -- but the movie isn't his life story; nor is it a character study. There's nothing about Murrow's personal life. In fact, Good Night, and Good Luck is not really about people at all. It's about the news. Viewers interested in news, history or politics will find much to enjoy, while others, hoping for a movie about personalities, may come away feeling that something is missing. One thing is certain, and that's that Clooney made the film he wanted to make. Shot in a high-contrast black and white, it opens at a banquet in 1958, at which Murrow is about to be honored. As the camera floats in and out of the crowd, take a moment to look at the faces: The actors are wearing 1950s clothing and hairstyles, and yet something in the actors' essences retain the telltale suggestion of 2005. The changes in consciousness from one era to another are subtle yet unmistakable. At this 1958 banquet, Murrow is supposed to take his award and say something nice, but instead he uses the platform to criticize TV news for becoming a form of empty escapism. As with all of Murrow's public pronouncements in Good Night, and Good Luck, the text is taken from Murrow's own words, and those words apply even more to today than yesterday. From there, we go back another five years, to the era of McCarthyism, character assassination and loyalty oaths. Murrow is cautioned to be balanced in his coverage, to which he replies, I can't accept the idea that every issue has two equally reasonable sides to it. It's an important point: When one side is lying and the other is telling the truth, it does the truth a disservice to present both positions as equally valid. Clooney lovingly re-creates the world of '50s television: The jolly cigarette commercials, the ancient technology (film instead of videotape) and the primitive ways of doing things. For example, during the broadcasts, producer Fred Friendly (Clooney) sits under Murrow's desk and taps his leg when the camera is on. The rickety nature of the medium makes Murrow and company seem all the more vulnerable as they take on McCarthy. In an inspired touch, McCarthy isn't played by an actor but by McCarthy himself, through archival footage. Time doesn't allow for more than snippets, though the actual See It Now episodes that the film dramatizes are available on DVD as part of The Edward R. Murrow Collection and are worth seeing. They show that, if anything, McCarthy was more sly, formidable and persuasive than the film reveals. Murrow still wins ultimately, but when McCarthy raises the specter of a terrible conspiracy and posits himself as the only possible savior, one can see how people might believe him. Clooney's point will not please everybody. Clooney is suggesting that the fear McCarthy was trading in, the fear people have of getting blown up, is pervasive today; that the spirit of McCarthy, an authoritarianism disguised in patriotic language, lives on; and that TV news is no longer a match for it. At a time when movies are straining to be innocuous, Goodnight, and Good Luck is a bold entry, to say the least. About half the public will also see it as patriotic. -- Advisory: This film contains adult subject matter and a mild bedroom scene. ",1
"Goyas Ghosts: Drama. Starring Stellan Skarsgard, Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman. Directed by Milos Forman. (R. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That Goya is the protagonist is worth noting because a lot of advance publicity is saying otherwise, perhaps to soothe the ego of Javier Bardem, who plays Father Lorenzo, a Catholic priest and a hard-line backer of the Inquisition. Bardem is probably the biggest star in Spain, and to persuade him to play a fictional priest and let a Swedish actor (Stellan Skarsgard) play Goya no doubt took some doing -- including the pretense that Lorenzo is the star of the film. Whatever it took, it was worth it, because both actors are brilliant, and with the fiery Bardem as Goya, it would have been a different picture. Skarsgard makes for an older and more placid Goya, and when we meet him in 1792, he is already in his late 40s and an established master. He's a man with nothing to prove. As the court painter, he navigates various political mine fields with a combination of geniality and nerve, though his skill seems instinctive, almost unconscious. He is focused on his art. He won't compromise it -- even if it means making the queen look even homelier than she is -- but at the same time he poses no threat to anyone. He has no ambition but to do what he's doing, and thus he seems to float a bit outside the world. Bardem, as an ostensibly withdrawn priest, presents another picture entirely. Bardem is cast against his nature, which is ideal in that it's clear from the beginning that Lorenzo is acting against his own nature. His light voice seems mannered. His mild and modest gestures can't fully suppress the ambitions and passions struggling to break out. Goya is a man at peace with himself, while Lorenzo is a man in turmoil, and because of that, and because the emotion of Goya's art speaks to Lorenzo in a subterranean way, he finds himself drawn to Goya. Lorenzo likes Goya, and yet never enough that we can stop worrying about the artist when the two men are in the same room. The dynamic, which would not be present if the actors' roles were reversed, is fascinating: Lorenzo's personality structure is built on a lie, and Goya sees through him. But if Goya were to indicate, by look or gesture, that he can see Lorenzo's essential fraudulence, he'd find himself in a dungeon somewhere. Lorenzo is a dangerous man who has found, in power, compensation for some essential lack of authenticity or character. Yes, they had them then, too. In this setup, it's usually the innocent who end up suffering, and in Goya's Ghosts that fate befalls Ines (Natalie Portman), a wealthy merchant's beautiful daughter who is the model for several of Goya's paintings. Wrongly accused of being Jewish, she is tortured by the Inquisition until she confesses, and is left in jail until Napoleon ends the Inquisition 15 years later. Goya's Ghosts gives us three faces of Portman: She's perfectly lovely as the young Ines, perfectly implausible later as Ines' 16-year-old prostitute daughter and perfectly ridiculous as the middle-aged Ines, ruined by incarceration: filthy, crazy and with a mouthful of awful teeth. As the ruined Ines, Portman keeps doing something weird with her jaw to indicate jaw disease. It's no more believable and considerably less palatable than what MGM might have done in the old days: They would have left Portman beautiful but put a white bride-of-Frankenstein streak through her hair. We would have gotten the idea without getting sick. Rich in color and period detail, the film attempts an epic sprawl it never quite achieves, but the movie is always enjoyable and interesting. Forman's depiction of the aftermath of a public execution is nothing less than masterful. The clash between Goya's effortless decency and Lorenzo's effortful self-promotion loses none of its fascination, and the political background, in which the French liberate Spain in order to exploit it, allows Forman to express his healthy cynicism about political movements. Born in Czechoslovakia in 1932, Forman saw oppression under the Nazis and the Communists, and some of that experience finds its way into the film. In the end, Goya's Ghosts plays as a kind of anecdote, a fictional footnote to history, depicting events that are not terribly important in themselves but are significant in their import. Art paved the way for Forman's liberation, and art was Goya's liberation, too, even as he lived in the midst of conflict. The point Forman is making is that art is the one human thing to believe in, and the only one that's lasting. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity and violence. ",1
"Grindhouse: Starring Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Kurt Russell, Michael Biehn and Vanessa Ferlito. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. (R. 191 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) That makes Grindhouse two movies in one. There's Planet Terror, by Rodriguez, about a horrible virus that turns people into flesh-eating zombies. And there's Death Proof, by Tarantino, a murder and revenge story. The Rodriguez segment is terrific and shows a director in complete control of tone, image and story. His horror film partakes of the vitality of the genre, even as he's satirizing it, so the film is always working in two ways -- for real and for laughs. The Tarantino, by contrast, has flashes of interest and eventually achieves a certain visceral impact, but it's long-winded and juvenile, the work of a director who hasn't grown and, what's more, seems afraid to try. The contrast is striking, and as surprising as the musical number at this year's Academy Awards when Beyoncé suddenly wiped the floor with Jennifer Hudson in their duet. One would think that grind house moviemaking would be the natural province of Tarantino. Instead, he indulges in long, puerile dialogue passages that no respectable grind house audience would ever have tolerated and that few Grindhouse patrons of today will enjoy -- not 2 1/2 hours into an evening. In truth, Tarantino doesn't even attempt a grind-house-style feature. His pace is the antithesis of the genre, and Death Proof is languorous and ruminative, the movie equivalent of a very dull, very stoned person offering up random thoughts. Fortunately, Rodriguez goes first, and he does everything right, including the small details. For example, in the film's one sex scene, the print quality suddenly becomes grainy, and there are missing frames. That's to replicate what would happen in the old movie houses, in which projectionists would screen the one lewd scene over and over in their off hours, and maybe snip out the most salacious sections to bring home for themselves. Rodriguez demonstrates a voluminous familiarity with the conventions of low-budget filmmaking circa 1980, and offers them up, one scene after another, with impressive fluency. Everything here we've seen before, sort of: The scene in which a patient, suffering from a mystery ailment, visits a doctor's office and something routine becomes something horrible. Or the scene in which we think someone is dead, but he springs up alive and joking around. Or the attempt by a frantic woman to get away in a car, while something or someone smashes her windshield. Or the parade of zombies that turns up out of nowhere, moving forward, never running, but getting ever closer. Rodriguez gives us these and more: There's the creepy but resilient guy who works at the cafe (Jeff Fahey) and the by-the-book cop (Michael Biehn) who finds himself fighting side-by-side with a man he once considered a criminal (Freddy Rodriguez). And, of course, there's the go-go dancer with a dream -- played by Rose McGowan, in the best showcase of her career so far. In making Planet Terror, it's as if Rodriguez tapped into some grind house side of his brain, and this emerged, fully formed and lots of fun. And he never forgets the first rule of action movies: If something can happen either now or later, have it happen now and just come up with something even bigger for later. As for Tarantino's Death Proof, you can watch it or just watch the trailers that precede it and leave, knowing that by then you've had your money's worth. It tells the story of four women who go to a bar for a long night of drinking. In the same bar is Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who has a car that he says is death proof. There's lots of banter about sex and movies and popular culture, and some of it is mildly interesting, and some of it is flat-out boring. Later, we meet four other women, and they do lots of talking, too, but there's also some action, and that's where it picks up a little. Tarantino, with his knack for casting, wisely puts real-life stunt double Zoe Bell in a key role. But the story is just an excuse for blather and unpleasantness. One thing about low-budget grind-house-style action movies: They always deliver on the story. They're the cinematic equivalent of beach-read novels: They hook you with the story and force you to put up with the rest. But while Rodriguez juggles a host of characters and delivers on a complicated plot, Tarantino offers up just another listless, linear revenge tale. It's as if he's not even trying. Maybe he thinks it isn't cool to try. -- Advisory: Graphic violence, nudity, strong language. ",1
"Guess Who: Comedy. Starring Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana. Directed byKevin Rodney Sullivan. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In 38 years, Guess Who will probably seem as dated as the earlier film seems today, but in the meantime this is a winning comedy, with solid comic performances from Bernie Mac as the father of a young black woman who shows up on his doorstep with a white guy, and from Ashton Kutcher, as the white guy. By reversing the races of the 1967 movie, Guess Who takes what still might have been a culturally loaded situation and automatically releases it into a more relaxed mode. Guess Who has two minor weaknesses, which don't get in the way of enjoyment, though they're hard to miss. The first is that it doesn't really aspire to much. It essentially takes a cinematic landmark, albeit a stodgy one, and turns it into the bi- racial equivalent of Meet the Parents. The second weakness is that, like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, it makes no case for the relationship at its center. In Guess Who, Kutcher and Zoe Saldana have even less reason to get married than Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton. They don't get along. They have no discernible bond, beyond the physical. When they talk, they don't even seem to listen to each other. Next remake, an effort should be made to make something special out of that relationship. Of course, the primary relationship in Guess Who isn't really between the young lovers but between Kutcher as Simon, an up-and-coming stockbroker, and Mac, as his potential father-in-law. As the chief loan officer of a bank, Percy (Mac) considers himself an expert in sizing up people, and after getting over the initial shock of Simon's whiteness, he starts grilling and testing Simon. There's something about this young man that he doesn't trust. Though a light comedy, director Kevin Rodney Sullivan keeps the acting values authentic and consistent. In portraying Simon's discomfort at meeting his potential in-laws, Kutcher doesn't play a comic version of discomfort -- he just acts genuinely uncomfortable. Playing it straight especially benefits Mac, who is no less funny for being restrained and who gets an opportunity to show that he can act. As Percy, he's more formidable than clownish, and his interaction with his wife and daughters has a tenderness that feels real, not cloying. He acts like a father, like someone familiar in that role. The script is full of witty moments, as when the younger sister (Kellee Stewart) comes home, sees Kutcher and asks, Are we getting audited? The supporting cast gets some of the best bits. Robert Curtis-Brown brings sly humor and expert timing to his role as a gay-seeming events planner (a metrosexual), and, as Percy's wife, Judith Scott cultivates the long- suffering, self-possessed demeanor of a woman who has had to get around a stubborn, hotheaded husband for 25 years. Alas, the one under-written role is that of Theresa, as the girlfriend. Saldana injects passion and a certain spontaneity into her scenes, but Theresa, as written, has little independent identity. She's just a girlfriend and a daughter. Guess Who is all in fun and succeeds on its own terms. But next time out, it would be interesting to see this same scenario, played again as a comedy, but with the races changed back to the 1967 configuration. -- Advisory: Sexual situations. ",1
"Gunner Palace: Documentary. Directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. (PG-13. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) most of them very young -- as they go on raids, have the occasional party and talk into the camera. Along the way, the film documents Iraq in this period of transition. What kind of Iraq will the United States leave? Only history knows, and therefore only history will be able to tell what exactly the makers of Gunner Palace have given us. Does Gunner Palace record the growing pains of a nascent democracy or is it a valuable record of an epic disaster in the making? The filmmakers don't impose a viewpoint and have enough humility in the face of history not to guess where it's all heading. They just keep the cameras running. Throughout, the rosy assessments of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld are played as a kind of ironic counterpoint to reality. But also throughout, we see Iraqis who are quite happy the Americans are there and have intelligent reasons for feeling that way. At times, watching Gunner Palace is as bleak as watching footage of American GIs in Vietnam, circa 1967. At other times, a better outcome seems possible. The soldiers are from small towns and modest financial backgrounds. Some of them are as young as 19. Sometimes they're cocky. Sometimes they're reflective. Sometimes they sound like snot-nosed kids plucked out of some mall and handed a gun, to the world's sorrow. At other times, they sound wise, older than their years and tempered by an experience that's harrowing and unrelenting. The one thing they all seem to share is a conviction that most Americans have no idea what they're going through and don't care, that Americans at home see war as a form of entertainment and don't dwell on the consequences. For you, it's just a show, but we live in this movie, raps one soldier. And another looks out over the road and laments that the only people who'll remember this is us. In one sequence, the soldiers raid a house because of a tip-off that bombs are supposedly being made inside it. They find no evidence of bombs, and when one of the men in the house, who says he's a journalist, tries to complain to the documentarian, he is taken outside camera range. Despite the absence of evidence, the men are arrested and sent to Abu Ghraib prison. In another disheartening moment, a soldier no older than 19 brags about making Iraqis cry by threatening to send them to Guantanamo Bay. He seems to think this is funny. Things we hear about on the news take on an urgency in Gunner Palace. A soldier points to scrap metal stuck to the sides of a truck, in lieu of real armor. With deadpan disgust, he says that the purpose of the scrap metal is to slow down the shrapnel so it stays in your body instead of going clean through. Another soldier talks about killing people and how he has learned to live with it. All of the soldiers worry about getting killed themselves and with good reason. Every time they turn a corner, they're on the lookout for a bomb or IED, as they call it -- an improvised explosive device. In one scene, they break down a door and find ladies sitting on a sofa, asking Why didn't you knock? A soldier answers, You can't knock on the bad guys. But it turns out, there are no bad guys at that location. However, there is a busted down door, now, and some bad will. Yet another raid -- of people financing the insurgency -- finds more than $140,000 in cash and lots of weapons. So it's good they didn't knock that time. Gunner Palace was filmed early in the war, between the fall of 2003 and the spring of last year. It's a documentary with no heroes or villains, just a lot of average people trapped in a hellish situation. -- Advisory: Lots of strong language -- stronger than can be found in any PG-13 film to date.

"HAIKU TUNNEL: Comedy. Starring Josh Kornbluth, Warren Keith, Helen Shumaker and Sarah Overman. Directed by Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The result is a winning comedy about a would-be novelist (named Josh Kornbluth) who is living in a depressive funk and working as an office temporary worker. Behind the laughs, a more serious story seems to lurk: Josh is a guy with nothing going on, nothing to live for and no pleasure but sleeping. He needs professional help. Indeed, it's the promise of health benefits -- which will pay for psychotherapy -- that persuades Josh to switch from temp to permanent status, when he takes a job at the San Francisco law firm Schuyler and Mitchell (S&M). In one of many well-observed bits in the film, Josh becomes visible in the eyes of his co-workers only once he goes perm. Haiku Tunnel is weak only in those moments that retain traces of its origin as a monologue. Almost nothing Kornbluth says directly to the audience is funny. Maybe it's the material, but probably it's Kornbluth, who pitches it too hard into the delicate camera, making him look as if he's begging for laughs, while onstage he might have been a scream. Bob Hope was the master of the direct-to-the-audience pitch. A few Hope videos, and Kornbluth should have that under control. When Kornbluth isn't acting to the camera but with the other actors, he is likable, emotionally true and has no trouble carrying a movie. Film also gives him an opportunity to do physical shtick: a funny low-status shuffle when the boss is around or, when he's late, an all-too-innocent float past the head secretary's desk. The boss of the secretaries is played by Bay Area performance artist Helen Shumaker, who is always good, and here she's good and spooky. She looks into Josh's soul, knows his weaknesses. In one of a fair number of laugh-out-loud moments, Josh wakes up at 2 in the morning and, following an irrational impulse, leaves a rambling, hours-long message on her voice mail, talking about his personal life. It's such sparks of craziness that take Haiku Tunnel -- and Kornbluth's work in general -- out of the land of pedestrian observation. He doesn't just recognize the absurdities of office conversation. He knows how to satirize it in a way that the pain underneath also comes through. One comic highlight, very simple but memorable, comes when Josh's co-worker Clifford (Brian Thorstenson) relates an encounter with one of the partners. Jack, I don't care if you're a partner. You owe me an apology, Clifford says, quoting himself. Then he repeats the quote, varies it, repeats the variation, over and over. Haiku Tunnel should be well received everywhere, but Bay Area audiences will have the added kick of seeing familiar faces. Anyone who has gone out to see a play in the past few years might recognize Warren Keith, who's very funny as a stiff, corporate boss; Amy Resnick, charming as Josh's perky co- worker Mindy; and the redoubtable Brian Russell, who appears here as an impassive security guard. Sarah Overman, in her film debut, registers a particularly strong impression as Julie, an attorney who becomes attracted to Josh, mistaking him for a tax lawyer with a bohemian streak. Overman has the self-possession, the magnetism and the all-important ability to think on camera that mark her as someone who will be making more movies. ",1
"HIGH CRIMES: Drama. Starring Ashley Judd, Morgan Freeman and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Carl Franklin. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . That's the jarring moment from the beginning of High Crimes, director Carl Franklin's effective thriller about a wife who finds herself defending her husband on a murder charge. It's a movie that feeds on audience outrage -- at the courts, at the military, at the federal government in general. It also works on our fear of strange noises in the next room and of shadowy figures in parked cars. High Crimes has some faults, but it manages to keep its audience either angry or jumpy from start to finish. Based on the novel by Joseph Finder, the film stars Ashley Judd as Claire, a successful attorney with an upscale Marin house and a husband, Tom (Jim Caviezel), who has all the manly virtues. He's handsome, he's a woodworker and, when the ovulation test reads positive, he can be called upon to make a baby in the five minutes his wife has before leaving for work. So it comes as a shock for Claire to find out that Tom is really named Ron. A former Marine, he is arrested and accused of freaking out and killing nine villagers while on assignment in El Salvador in 1988. Framed by higher-ups who are using the case to cover their own crimes, Ron wouldn't have a prayer if his wife weren't a lawyer played by Ashley Judd. The role of Claire makes intelligent use of Judd's sledgehammer relentlessness, her fury, her focus, her loquaciousness. It's a good Judd role but not an ideal one, because unlike, say, Double Jeopardy, High Crimes doesn't capitalize on her wild-woman delight in herself, nor on her danger. Here she's mainly a victim, a surrogate for the audience's indignation. The movie's spark, its flash of the unexpected, instead must come from Morgan Freeman as Grimes, a crafty old attorney with a falling-down office and a drinking problem. Both genteel and seedy, he uses underworld friends, such as prostitutes, to gather information. Meanwhile, the movie's wild woman isn't Judd but Amanda Peet, in a likable featured role as Claire's ne'er-do-well sister. High Crimes is the story of a seemingly insurmountable challenge, with the defense team -- Judd and Freeman, joined by a wet-behind-his-ears military attorney (Adam Scott) -- up against a federal monolith. The other side has guns, armies, a willingness to do anything and the ability to make any crime look like an accident. If the defense attorneys start winning in court, they have to worry about getting killed on the way home. About five years ago, we saw a run of paranoid thrillers, such as Absolute Power and The Shadow Conspiracy, in which the government was not to be trusted. High Crimes, with a few twists, harks back to those movies. It also touches on areas that are of special interest today, such as civilian oversight of covert actions and the makeup and conduct of a military court. The dramatic focus of High Crimes gets a bit fuzzy in the last half hour - - it starts to feel as if some scenes get replayed. Still, the scenes are never dull, and the movie recovers for the big finish. Only one thing is lacking throughout, not a big thing, but big enough to mention. We keep hearing about what great lawyers Claire and Grimes are, but there's no great courtroom scene. In that, High Crimes is too much like real life. It gives us court with no courtroom fireworks. . This film contains violence. ",1
"HOLLYWOOD ENDING: Comedy. Starring Woody Allen, Tea Leoni and Treat Williams. Directed by Woody Allen. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Over the years, I've come to think of horrible Allen movies such as Celebrity or Everyone Says I Love You as like sewage that simply needs to be flushed through a pipe so that clear waters of inspiration might flow -- and bring along a gem every few years, such as Allen's latest, Hollywood Ending. It's not a masterpiece like Annie Hall, but that's not the way to think about it. Instead, imagine if this were Allen's first movie. Audiences and critics would be floored by the sheer funniness of the one-liners: To me the best part of masturbation is afterward -- the cuddling time. They'd also be impressed by the screenplay's heart and humanity, by the economy of storytelling and by the delightful ensemble cast. This is an excellent comedy, and the fact that it's made by a filmmaker with even better movies on his resume is nothing to hold against it. Allen plays Val Waxman, a two-time Oscar-winning director whose neurosis and temperament have made him unhirable, except to make deodorant commercials in Canada. But his ex-wife Ellie (Tea Leoni) throws him a lifeline. She gets him a job directing a $60 million picture for her new lover, Hal (Treat Williams), a big-shot studio honcho. I would kill for this job, Val (Allen) says, but the people I'd want to kill are the people offering me the job. In Leoni, Allen finds his most artistically compatible female co-star since Mia Farrow, and not since Diane Keaton has he had one who could play off him as well comedically. In one of the movie's best scenes, the ex-spouses meet to discuss business, but the rejected husband's bitterness keeps diverting the conversation. Leoni's comic exasperation and timing are expert, as when she refuses to let Allen deny that he was a demented hypochondriac. Black plague? Elm blight? Only trees get elm blight. Plot intrudes early in the picture, when Val gets a case of psychosomatic blindness, which hits him only days before he is to commence shooting the movie. At first it seems like an arbitrary and none-too-promising story development, like the hypnotism gimmick that runs all through Allen's Curse of the Jade Scorpion. But Allen makes the blindness angle work, milking it for sight gags and slapstick bits. Val decides to conceal his blindness and direct the movie anyway, and the spectacle of him bluffing on the set makes for lots of funny moments. Allen uses Hollywood Ending to get in his usual shots at Los Angeles and the movie business -- Val is paid $500,000 to direct the picture plus a tenth of a point after quadruple break-even. Yet wisely, Allen doesn't have Williams play the studio boss as a caricature but rather as a brusque, relatively reasonable businessman. George Hamilton also has a role as a studio executive whose actual function on the set is a mystery to everyone. Particularly winning -- in fact, he's practically adorable -- is Mark Rydell as Val's agent, one of those old-time agents who's always smiling and schmoozing and who worries about his clients like an old uncle. Watching the movie, you might wonder where they've been hiding this wonderful character actor, but look again at the name. Rydell is best known as a director, the man behind the The Rose and On Golden Pond. - This film contains sexual situations. ",1
"Have you ever seen something in the shadows, some ominous outline that made you uneasy, and then watched it vanish when you turned on the lights? “Lights Out” takes that common source of unease and crafts a smart little horror movie around it, one that neither goes for cheap effects nor overstays its welcome. The result is a nice calling card for first-time feature’s director David F. Sandberg, and pretty good entertainment in its own right.It’s one thing to have a good idea. It’s even better when that idea is essentially visual. The gimmick here is that there is a monster of some kind — an evil spirit, a psychological emanation, something bad for sure — that only has power in darkness. Turn on all the lights, and she’s gone (the thing is female). But in the shadows, she terrorizes, claws and devours. And you’d be amazed at the power outages that happen when she’s around.Just a few random bad things, common to modern horror movies, that “Lights Out” doesn’t do: There is no stupid misuse of the soundtrack, with thunderous chords crashing down and making everybody jump. There isn’t a high body count. There isn’t a pat explanation for what is going on. Instead some things are left mysterious, for us to fill in according to our own understanding of the moral universe.“Lights Out” presents actual characters that are interesting, that have rough edges, that act like real people, not victims in waiting. Martin (Gabriel Bateman) is a little boy whose father recently died. But the boy’s real problem is that his mother — an increasingly wiggy Maria Bello — is entertaining a malicious evil spirit. At first, the boy thinks Mom is talking to herself all night, which would have been bad enough. Then he sees that no, Mom is actually talking to something that is there, that is evil and that wants to kill him.Then there is Teresa Palmer as Rebecca, a young woman who has confidence and strength but a real problem when it comes to emotional commitment. We soon realize why — she is the little boy’s sister and grew up in the same house with their nutty mother. She doesn’t trust emotion because she saw too much of it as a child. And now things are coming to a head with Mom, and she has to assume some of her brother’s care.The good idea at the heart of “Lights Out” gives it an advantage, but the truth is, bad horror movies have been made from good ideas. What distinguishes “Lights Out” is that it follows through on its premise. It doesn’t blast through characters, pile up corpses and try to make you anxious that, at any moment, you might be forced to see something disgusting. It stays grounded in its specific situation, which is terrible in its own right, and because it keeps it real, it keeps the audience imagining themselves in the characters’ predicament.In the end, it’s just a little horror movie, but the director knows that and doesn’t overplay his hand. Sandberg gets the job done in 81 minutes, and in the process shows that he knows how to make a horror movie and that he has the talent to make other kinds of films as well. ",1
"Heading South: Drama. Starring Charlotte Rampling, Karen Young and Menothy Cesar. Directed by Laurent Cantet. (Not rated. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What starts as merely odd gradually comes to look like a devil's version of paradise. Karen Young plays Brenda, an American woman who travels to a Haitian resort in the 1970s on a sexual quest. Three years before, she had sex with a 15-year-old Haitian boy on the beach, and in that time she has been unable to think of anything else. Her marriage has collapsed, and she's on her own. But when she gets to the resort, she finds that the young man, Legba (Menothy Cesar), is the sexual consort of another woman, Ellen, a university professor played by Charlotte Rampling. In fact, the resort is made up entirely of middle-aged, unattached women from the United States and Canada who have come to have sex with the boys, a privilege they pay for through cash and gifts. Ellen, the queen bee among the women, comes every year and stays for months. These women are not rich ladies. They're middle-class and lonely, and they just happen to have enough money to vacation at an inexpensive beach club in a dirt-poor country. This is no Chippendale's, though the women act as though it were. The women, sexually invisible and in effect cast off by their world, are driven by a need to prey on children. The atmosphere is festive, but the laughter is hollow. Vulnerable in their lack of allure, they have found a country where the men are even more hopeless and powerless than they are. This is shocking, though perhaps the most shocking thing about it is that it's moving. Rampling -- this has to be considered her great period -- gives another sterling performance, assuming a manner for Ellen that's quite unlike anything we've seen from her. As the film starts, she has a curt way of talking and a superior smile that's like a reflex or a mask. It's the face of a confident, assertive person in a state of round-the-clock denial, a denial that's multifaceted. A 55-year-old woman who prides herself on her realistic grasp of things, she can't face that what she's doing is grotesque and exploitative, no more than she can admit that she has fallen in giddy, hopeless love with an 18-year-old boy. When Brenda (Young) comes on the scene, with her desperate needs and romantic projections, the women engage in a competition for who gets to prostitute Legba. The bleakness that surrounds the little beach club -- the poverty, the misery, the squalor -- can't really be held at bay. The sexual transaction itself becomes radiant with the corruption outside the gates. The women are lost, clinging to rafts made of human flesh, not realizing they, too, are a corruptive force. They're indicted by their linguistic and psychological denial of what their pleasures consist of, and yet we feel sorry for them. Heading South, directed by Laurent Cantet (Human Resources, Time Out), features two extraordinary performances, both involving subtly executed but profound moral and emotional transformations. For Rampling, the self-satisfied facade she adopts for Ellen is just an opening strategy. Gradually, painfully, inexorably, she is revealed to herself. For Brenda, the revelation is the power of her own hunger, and its selfishness. Unlike what just about any actress would do under the circumstances, Young does nothing to cozy up to the audience. It's a brave, uncompromising performance that wisely keeps a few pieces of the puzzle missing, that keeps us wondering. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and simulated sex. ",1
"Helen Hunt as  Cheryl Cohen Greene  and John Hawkes as  Mark O'Brien  in SessionsHelen Hunt as Cheryl Cohen Greene and John Hawkes as Mark O'Brien in SessionsHelen Hunt and John Hawkes in Ben Lewin's The Sessions.Helen Hunt and John Hawkes in Ben Lewin's The Sessions.(10-31) 17:48 PDT SAN FRANCISCO -- One sure way to tell that The Sessions is bound to be an exceptional movie is that the subject of it sounds like nothing anyone would want to see. The story of a man in an iron lung who decides that he wants to experience sex could not have gotten funding on its premise alone. Obviously, there had to be something there, and there is.  The Sessions is moving. At times, it's even erotic, which is unexpected, to say the least. It sends viewers out of the theater with a heightened sense of the physical and a real feeling for all the things that sex means in human life. The Sessions goes beyond what movies usually deal with when they talk about love - attraction, the mating dance, the happily-ever-after. It's about people's most basic need to connect, express and feel through sexuality. The film is raw and adult and, in the least somber way imaginable, unusually dignified. Based on the real-life story of Mark O'Brien, a Bay Area poet and journalist who died in 1999, it dramatizes a period in the 1980s when, at 38, O'Brien hired a sex therapist. Among the ancillary revelations of The Sessions, for those of us previously in ignorance, is that hands-on sex therapy is nothing like prostitution. Part therapist, part sex partner, part life coach, the therapist (Helen Hunt) ministers to a severely disabled patient and makes him feel as if he's part of the world. She helps bring him into  the world. If anything, this is like missionary work.  John Hawkes plays the entire role on his back. (You might find yourself turning your head sideways to get a look at his face.) As played by Hawkes, O'Brien is a sweet and witty person, who wants to get as much out of life as he can. A polio victim, he can only move his head and needs the iron lung to breathe, though he can go as long as three hours outside of it. He is about as physically limited as a person can be, but with all the longings, even the romantic longings, of an able-bodied person. Written and directed by Ben Lewin, The Sessions is most impressive in the way its tone harmonizes a whole range of different scenes and moods. The scenes between the devout O'Brien and his parish priest (William H. Macy), in which he discusses his plans to pursue sex therapy, are funny in a straightforward comic way. But the sex therapy scenes - the sessions that give the film its title - are clinical, explicit and wrenching. People will leave the theater talking about Hawkes, about the role's physical difficulty, Hawkes' emotional nakedness, and the way he conveys, just in his demeanor, a history of lifelong disability. But this is a movie with two remarkable performances, and in The Sessions Hunt gets her best screen opportunity in years.  As you might expect, Hunt plays the sex therapist with her usual matter-of-fact directness, but she adds something else - something skewed - the eccentricity that could allow her to do this kind of work. It's also worth noting that in those sexual sessions, Hunt is the one who is completely naked, under brutal lighting that would give a 25-year-old pause. She looks great, but make no mistake: Hawkes may be depicting bravery in The Sessions, but Hunt is the one who's being brave.------------------Cheryl Cohen Greene, the sex therapist played by Helen Hunt in The Sessions, tells her story in a Jan. 10 Chronicle profile. tinyurl.com/8tlrcnt.",1
"Helen Mirren portrays Alma Reville, the wife of director Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins), in the new film Hitchcock.Helen Mirren portrays Alma Reville, the wife of director Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins), in the new film Hitchcock.Scarlett Johansson plays Janet Leigh, Anthony Hopkins is Alfred Hitchcock and Helen Mirren is Alma Reville in Hitchcock.Scarlett Johansson plays Janet Leigh, Anthony Hopkins is Alfred Hitchcock and Helen Mirren is Alma Reville in Hitchcock.Drama. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Sacha Gervasi. (PG-13. 98 minutes.) Hitchcock tells the story of the making of Psycho - or, as Alfred Hitchcock pronounced it, Psyyyy-cow - a film that was a trauma and a sensation in its own time and still has the capacity to shock. Released in 1960, that movie retains an aura of the forbidden, of something sordid and unwholesome, bordering on a snuff film. So imagine how studio heads reacted when Hitchcock, hot off the success of North by Northwest, insisted on making an ugly, grainy, black and white movie about a serial killer. Hitchcock stars Anthony Hopkins as the Hitchcock of legend, seemingly implacable, and always dressed in his regulation dark suit and skinny tie. (Actually, JFK dressed in a similar way, but somehow the vibe was different.) The film begins with him deciding on Psycho for his next film and takes him through the process of raising money, casting, filming, editing and premiering the new picture. Along the way, Hitchcock emerges as an entertaining, economical and thoroughly enjoyable glimpse into a familiar artist's creative process. This time Hitchcock's wife, Alma Reville, gets her due as a collaborator working in every phase of production. She is far from just a sounding board, but a screenwriter and story editor who has the authority to take over on the set when Hitchcock is ill and the ability to save the picture during the editing.  Hopkins is a fundamentally benign Hitchcock, hiding his vulnerability, neuroses and unrealized longings behind a mountain of impassivity and corpulence. He is a nice man, while the real Hitchcock seems to have been a more complicated figure. Likewise, no matter how much Helen Mirren tries to suppress her feistiness and allure as Alma Reville, she can hardly disappear. And so when Hitchcock begins to worry that his wife has become interested in another man, it means something different that Mirren is the source of the worry - Mirren is still a woman who can wreck a man's life. The real Reville wasn't that kind of siren. In this way, Hitchcock is made to please a modern audience, providing us with a Hitchcock we can like and an Alma we must respect. Scarlett Johansson, at her most charming, plays Janet Leigh with a sweet deference, as though it were she herself getting a miraculous, time-travel chance to work with the master of suspense. Finally, there's James D'Arcy playing Anthony Perkins and doing the best Perkins imitation the world has ever seen, all angles and elbows and with an apology in every glance. If Hitchcock has a fault, it's that there is too little to challenge us, too little that's unexpected, and nothing to rub us the wrong way. It's not at all like a Hitchcock movie. In a series of fantasy sequences, Hitchcock is tormented by thoughts of Ed Gein, the murderer who inspired Robert Bloch's original novel, but these hardly take us into Hitchcock's unsavory depths. Speaking of unsavory, the film doesn't bother to mention that Hitchcock got the rights to Psycho through a blind bid, so as to lowball Bloch with a minuscule offer.  There's not enough in the writing of Hitchcock to allow for a great performance from Hopkins, but he's certainly game, even if he does occasionally sound as much like Michael Caine as he does Hitchcock. Ultimately, what saves him and everyone connected with the picture is that Psycho is just so interesting and Hitchcock commits itself to dramatizing its creation. It's fascinating to see a classic being built from the ground up, to see it fail and then burst to life in the editing process, and to see Hitchcock standing in the lobby listening as the audience reacts to the shower scene.  Hitchcock isn't ambitious or complicated. It's simple, does what it sets out to do, and gets out before anyone even thinks about checking the time. More movies should be made in its image.",1
"Here’s a case of a pleasing average movie. We don’t get many of those. We get movies great and awful, and then we get movies that have strong virtues but are obnoxious or repellent. But movies like “Masterminds,” which is right on the line between good and bad, but whose problems don’t outweigh its pleasures, are rare. And so perhaps a little grade inflation is in order.A comedy based on the 1997 Loomis Fargo robbery in North Carolina, “Masterminds” tells the story of a motley gang that robbed a security company of $17 million in cash, the biggest heist in American history. On the downside, the movie is something of a mishmash of tones, and the end brings no particular sense of arrival. The story just stops where it had to stop, and viewers walk out feeling about the same as when they went in.But the movie has one great, redeeming quality, which is its comic acting. In the two lead roles, it has Zach Galifianakis and Kristen Wiig, who are able to be hilarious without playing for comedy. They are completely in their roles, completely invested in the seriousness and truth of their characters’ thoughts and emotions, but they are aware, as if watching from the tiniest of distances, that they are playing ridiculous people. And so they tilt it just a bit and open a window into human absurdity.They’re just two people having an office flirtation. David (Galifianakis) and Kelly (Wiig) both work at Loomis, and then some months after she leaves, she falls in with a bad crowd, including Steve (Owen Wilson), who gets the idea to rob Loomis. But they need an inside man. You know, someone easily persuadable, not too smart, someone so crazy about Kelly that he’d do anything ... It’s a  strong role for Galifianakis, almost tailor-made for a comedian specializing in dim-witted losers with profound aspirations and a delusional sense of dignity and possibility. There’s something strangely appealing about a character who wants the world and doesn’t know how pathetic he is — maybe because we all secretly wonder if we’re in the same boat and just don’t know it.As for Wiig, who leads him on by making him believe that, if he does this, they will go to Mexico and have a great romance, she does several things at once and makes them look as natural as breathing. She has to be genuinely seductive, but also a parody of seduction. She has to convey a complete physical indifference to this guy, but an emotional sympathy. And most of what she does is without words, just a face onscreen. Don’t be distracted by how funny she is — Wiig is one of the most interesting actresses we have right now.Not everything works so well. Jason Sudeikis shows up as a perverted hit man, and he does a fine job of being creepy, but the character itself is discordant and strains at the boundaries of the comedy.But “Masterminds” delivers for the most part. Kate McKinnon, as David’s wife, does her usual frozen-faced, crazy-eyed weird thing, but this time she’s funny. And director Jared Hess, either through his own invention or an intelligent willingness to let his actors run with it, finds little ways to lift almost every scene.You might forget “Masterminds” five minutes after you see it, but you’ll enjoy it in the moment.",1
"Here’s a case where the screenwriter’s signature is the strongest element onscreen. “The Girl on the Train” was directed by Tate Taylor (“The Help”) and based on the best-seller of the same name by Paula Hawkins. But in feeling and aura, it’s much more like “Chloe” and other films written by its screenwriter, Erin Cressida Wilson.There’s an atmosphere here that’s hard to describe, a kind of mournful eroticism. Sex and sexual possibility are in the air, but so are betrayal, melancholy and loss — and hovering out there, too, a hint of real twistedness. And the wellspring of all this flailing human behavior, all these pathetic attempts to connect, is longing. It is the face pressed up against the window, the despairing need to feel whole.This is the ideal tone — an ennobling and enriching tone — for a story that begins with a woman sitting on a train, looking into the houses as they go by, wondering about the lives taking place behind those windows. Rachel (Emily Blunt) is a complete mess, a blackout drunk and an emotional wreck, but the one thing she has left is a grand romantic yearning. And so she fixates on a young woman that she imagines to have the ideal life.In fact, the woman, Megan — played by Haley Bennett, a commanding presence — is nothing but confused and angry, with a tragic past and an unsettled present. She has the surface confidence that Rachel lacks, but she is utterly lost. And though her beauty gives her a certain power over people, it only gives her license to lose herself more.The movie’s trio of turbulent women is completed by Anna (Rebecca Ferguson), who is married to Rachel’s ex-husband, Tom (Justin Theroux). She is seemingly normal, besotted with her baby daughter and seemingly happy in her marriage, but there are cracks, both in her moral nature and in her facade of contented domesticity.A missing-person case unites these characters into a single story, with Blunt remaining mostly at the center. She’s obsessed. She’s drunk half the time, and when she shows up at an Alcoholics Anonymous, it’s always day one. She stumbles into the investigation and gets in the way of the police, particularly Allison Janney as a detective who looks at her with a professional’s scorn. Yet she keeps stumbling closer to the truth.“The Girl on the Train” may be too idiosyncratic and moody to get the credit it deserves, but if there’s any justice, Blunt should be up for awards consideration at the end of the year. She gives a remarkably invested and unflinching performance. She contains her natural wit, brightness and intelligence — she conceals her attractiveness — and encases herself in a physical condition and a psychological cloud. She piles on the damage, but she doesn’t play the damage. She plays the struggle to break through. It’s a performance of technical precision, emotional perception and inspiration.Of course, when the acting is strong across the board, it has something to do with the director. Taylor directed Viola Davis to an Oscar nomination for “The Help,” and with “The Girl on the Train,” he may very well have made a star of Bennett. Meanwhile, Ferguson continues to demonstrate a capacity to transform entirely for each role (“Mission Impossible — Rogue Nation,” “Florence Foster Jenkins”) and be memorable and arresting each time.But the most exciting contribution to “The Girl on the Train” is that of Wilson. It’s exciting because it shows that it’s possible, despite the odds, for a distinctive screenwriter to express herself consistently and dominate a film. And it’s exciting because this is a unique voice, and very much a woman’s voice, that our cinema needs.",1
"Hidalgo: Adventure. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Omar Sharif and Louise Lombard. Directed by Joe Johnston. (PG-13. 133 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Loosely based on the life of Frank T. Hopkins, a former cowboy who entered many long-distance horse races, Hidalgo gives us this iconic American: He talks when he has to. He helps out when possible. He's open to new ideas. He lives and lets live. He believes it's possible to do things. And he is in touch with nature. Even his horse likes him. His horse likes him a lot. It's a long movie, too long, in fact, though the cuts should have all come from the beginning. After a slow start, it moves. Mortensen plays Frank, half Indian by blood, who rides a brown and white mustang named Hidalgo. Early in the film Frank witnesses the massacre at Wounded Knee, and this turns him into a drunk, doing tricks for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The Buffalo Bill show has been evoked in other films, but rarely in a way so mercenary and depressing, as a place where soothing myths were sold to the public by precisely the people who knew better. Hidalgo has similarities to The Last Samurai, in which Tom Cruise also becomes a drunk after witnessing the massacre of an American Indian village, but Cruise, more flamboyant by nature, becomes a bigger drunk and gets into bigger trouble. By contrast, Mortensen plays Frank as saddened by what he sees, but more disgusted than surprised. Lost in his own country, he decides to go away to find himself. He accepts an offer to go to the Middle East and enter a race across the Iraqi desert to Damascus, competing against the greatest horsemen and horses in Arabia. The film's frequent mention of Iraq and Syria in a film set a century ago could make one wonder if Hidalgo is intended as some kind of allegory, but the story is straightforward, concentrating not on the merits of any particular culture but on the physical and internal struggles of a single individual. America in 1890 is messy, and Frank finds the Middle East just as messy, full of conflicts and rivalries. Omar Sharif plays the Sheikh of Sheikhs, and one can only imagine how thrilled the filmmakers must have been to cast him. Who better to play the Sheikh of Sheikhs? He's a man of honor and a loving, indulgent father, who nonetheless treats his daughter (Zuleikha Robinson) like a dishrag when men are around and who plans on marrying her off as the fourth wife of a bad guy. What Sharif brings to the role is a complete understanding of how such a man - - contradictory by Western standards -- could make perfect sense in a Middle Eastern context. Thus, we understand, too, the unyielding influence of tradition in the Sheikh's every decision. The journey through the desert comes complete with two bizarre natural occurrences -- an obviously computer-generated sandstorm and a less obviously canned sky-blackening swarm of locusts. Will someday computer- generated sequences seem as laughably fake to most people as old-fashioned rear projection does today? It's inevitable. These obligatory action touches, as well as the failure of the film to make completely clear which rider is on which horse and who has a financial stake in whom, are about the worst that can be said for Hidalgo. The good things are many: Sharif's playfulness and dignity. The cool, complicated villainy of Louise Lombard, as the amoral Lady Davenport, who wants her horse to win at any cost. And Mortensen, who says little but sees all, and seems to understand all, from a place not of judgment but of tolerance. Over the course of the film, every kind of treachery is thrown at Frank -- not to mention knives and spears -- and he just deals with it, neither outraged nor frightened. If this kind of American hero no longer exists -- especially if he no longer exists -- he's a nourishing vision all the same. -- Advisory: This film contains violence. ",1
"Honeydripper: Drama. Starring Danny Glover, Yaya DaCosta and Gary Clark Jr. Directed by John Sayles. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) John Sayles makes long movies that are dull in places, but eventually he gets somewhere, and he does with Honeydripper, his rumination about the birth of rock 'n' roll in the Deep South. The scene is Alabama in 1950, in a club called the Honeydripper Lounge, where the owner decides to bring in some new sounds to attract a younger clientele.  Even more than the music in this musically rich picture, the great pleasure of Honeydripper is in watching Danny Glover as Tyrone Purvis, the club owner. Playing a man trying to stay afloat in the face of competition, hard times and a white sheriff (Stacy Keach), Glover changes his walk, stiffens his posture and even tightens his facial expressions. I have seen the man he's playing, or men like him, but not for a long time. What Glover is doing is channeling a certain type he once knew, a kind of man who was a certain age when Glover was very young. Watching Glover here is like watching memory made flesh, or some psychic excavation. It's going back in time.  Yet it's subtle - the subtlety is the beauty of it. You won't notice if you don't pay attention, but if you do, you'll see it all in Glover's face and in the way he carries himself: a dignity that's innate but also earned, the wariness and dread that keep his back tense and straight, and a painful past that manifests as gentleness toward the weak. When you watch him, you'll have no doubt that this is a black man who has spent his whole life in the segregated South but has somehow managed not to break or even bend.  He's a character we'd like to spend some time with, and we do. Sayles likes to let his movies breathe. Sometimes he lets them breathe until they die, but he can afford to luxuriate in the atmosphere of Honeydripper because his story is simple and dramatic: This is Purvis' big weekend. If he makes enough money, he can pay off the mob, pay off the sheriff and keep his club. If he doesn't, he'll lose everything and probably get his legs broken - at least. The Alabama town is lonely in its smallness and poverty and with the whistle of the train going by, always heading somewhere else. But the music is the evidence of things unseen. The town's longing and its life of the spirit come out in the blues and in the exuberance of early rock 'n' roll. The blues may be sad, and rock 'n' roll might be happy, but they're both about resiliency - about facing things and coming back, if only with a song. And so it should come as no surprise that after a slow but considered opening, Honeydripper picks up. Glover, who's wonderful, isn't alone out there. Yaya DaCosta is touching as his delicate daughter, too lovely for this place, and Keach as the sheriff is fascinating to watch. His face is cold but not impassive, and it's possible to read in his eyes every gradation of envy, admiration, fear, resentment and sadistic amusement that he experiences as he looks at Purvis.  Meanwhile, real-life guitarist and singer Gary Clark Jr. keeps the club jumping as Sonny, an early rock 'n' roller who stumbles into town with one of the first-ever electric guitars. Among the many smart things Sayles did in Honeydripper is record the music live on the set so that Clark wouldn't have to mouth the words to a canned track. The energy onscreen makes its way into the audience. -- Advisory: This film contains violence and strong language.",1
"Hoodwinked. Animated comedy. Directed by Cory Edwards, co-directed by Todd Edwards and Tony Leech. Produced by Maurice Kanbar. With voices of Glenn Close, Anne Hathaway, Jim Belushi, Patrick Warburton. (Rated PG. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Red (voice of Anne Hathaway) and the other main characters are under police investigation following a series of thefts in the woods. The basic story of how the wolf (Patrick Warburton) winds up disguised as Granny (Glenn Close) is retold from four wacky perspectives -- a comic take on Rashomon. The familiar characters get new twists -- Red is a savvy kid who knows karate, Granny is addicted to extreme sports, and the Woodsman (Jim Belushi) is a dingbat who drives a schnitzel truck but is really an actor. Twitchy, a chittering, manic squirrel voiced by co-director Cory Edwards, is by far the most amusing figure, but has a small role. (Other characters are voiced by Chazz Palminteri and David Ogden Stiers.) As usual with these fairy-tale put-ons, there's a barrage of wisecracks, throwaway lines and anachronisms; some of the jokes are good, many are predictable. The animation style seems a bit dated, and the so-so musical numbers feel tacked on. Audiences used to Pixar- and DreamWorks-level animation are likely to notice these shortcomings. Sad to say, Hoodwinked seems little more than multiplex fodder. -- Advisory: Rated PG for some mild action and thematic elements. -- Walter Addiego 'Following Sean'  Documentary. Featuring Sean Farrell. Directed by Ralph Arlyck. (Not rated. 87 minutes. At the Lumiere Theatre in San Francisco, the Act 1 & 2 in Berkeley, and the Smith Rafael Film Center in San Rafael.) At its exhilarating best, Following Sean is reminiscent of the lauded British documentaries that began with 7 Up and continued to follow a cross-section of 7-year-olds into adulthood to see how they turned out. Only one kid is featured in the new film. But Sean Farrell is such a charmer and his upbringing so bizarre from a 21st century perspective that he hardly needs company. Sean is first seen as a precocious 4-year-old more than ready for his close-up. Hippiedom is in full swing in the Haight-Ashbury, where the boy lives in the same building as novice filmmaker Ralph Arlyck. Looking for a project for a film class at San Francisco State, Arlyck turns his camera on his guileless neighbor with the dancing eyes and Beatles mop. Sitting barefoot on Arlyck's couch, Sean casually talks about his preference for eating pot instead of smoking it and how he can always spot speed freaks because they're all skin and bones. The short black-and-white film that results becomes a cause celebre on the film festival circuit in the late 1960s, sharing a bill with François Truffaut's The Wild Child at Cannes. Scenes from the short are interspersed throughout Following Sean, in which Arlyck returns to San Francisco almost three decades later to see what became of his own wild child. Unlike the 7 Up series, in which its subjects were interviewed at seven-year intervals, the documentary leaps from Sean as a little boy to him fully grown with no footage of the intervening years. Sean and his relatives -- including the parents who presumably sanctioned his marijuana use and allowed him to roam the Haight alone -- fill in the gap verbally. But listening to them talk about Sean's evolution into a responsible adult against all odds can never be as involving as watching it happen. The bigger problem is that Arlyck has to figure out how to fill the screen between Sean's sporadic appearances. The director makes an unfortunate decision to graft on his own story of how he wound up in the Haight, why he left and what became of him. The film transmutes into Following Ralph as Arlyck interviews his parents, his wife and family and slips in clips from his later work. You get the sense it's a pain to be anywhere in the vicinity of his camera. Turning it on his adolescent son eating dinner while Arlyck is in the midst of another documentary, the youngster asks quite reasonably, What does this have to do with a film about human rights? More to the point, what does it have to do with a film about Sean Farrell? Fortunately, Sean turns up again in the nick of time to spark our interest. He's 31 and working steadily as an electrician in San Francisco. He's even a union member. Meanwhile, his father, who renounced the suburban life in Redwood City to be a free spirit in the Haight, still can't hold down a regular job and lives in a trailer with no savings. Sean loves him, but can't understand his transient existence. Arlyck quickly re-establishes his bond with Sean and gets him to open up about his feelings. He's as magnetic onscreen as he was at 4. The film chronicles him throughout his 30s as he marries and has a son, who by the end is the same age as his father when he was first captured on celluloid. The unanswered question in Following Sean is why its subject isn't strung out in prison. Remembering back to the short film, Dad may have been a positive influence when he appointed Sean his little helper building a boat in which they were to sail around the world. That never happened. But by allowing his son to handle tools at such a young age, did he give Sean the tools for his eventual livelihood? Or are some kids just so resilient they can survive anything? -- Ruthe Stein 'April's Shower' Romantic comedy. Starring Maria Cina and Trish Doolan. Written and directed by Trish Doolan. (98 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) The phrase lesbian comedy is not exactly an oxymoron, but April's Shower is still a rarity, an expansive, talky and often zany romantic farce, with lesbian characters at its center. It's written and directed by Trish Doolan, who for her feature debut also took the lead role, which she handles with wit and assurance. The film has a pleasant spirit and lively dialogue, and what's more, seems to be coming from a specific cultural and geographical location. The entire film takes place over the course of a bridal shower, in and around one house, and plays out almost in real time, and yet it conveys the sense of a context outside its specific setting. The characters, gay and straight, come from a distinctly Irish-Catholic world, in which everyone knows the parish priest and most go to Sunday Mass. The house and its exteriors may look like California (that might be a consequence of the budget), but the vibe is East Coast, either New York or New Jersey. Doolan plays Alex, a chef who is single-handedly preparing the food for her friend April's bridal shower. She is fraught and irritated, and not only because she's cooking but because she's heartbroken: She lived with April (Maria Cina) for five years, in a secret affair. None of their straight friends or family knew they were lesbians. In terms of story, Doolan does something impressive consistently: Every time the audience gets to the point that it can guess what will ultimately happen, she has it happen immediately. For example, anyone watching the movie might expect the revelation of Alex and April's affair to come at the end, but no. Alex blows April's cover early on. Though for brief moments, the movie sometimes feels about to spin out of control into freneticism and repetitive banter, there's always something happening, always something to look forward to, and a fair amount of surprises. By shooting in one location, Doolan made it easy on herself. But by having the movie take place entirely at a party, she gave herself the burden of having to introduce and juggle about two dozen characters, all of whom she tries to give their due. Some of the side stories are forced, including a tiresome bit about a strange Scottish man (Euan MacDonald) stalking one of April's friends. (Typical of the movie's benign spirit, it makes the mistake of trying to present him as a lovable romantic.) Other subplots work quite well, for example one about a lesbian painter (Honey Labrador) gradually coming to realize that her relationship has hit a dead end. The actors are either especially good (Doolan, Cina, Labrador) or do their job. Nothing jars. It's an admirable first feature. Advisory: Ribald humor, sexual situations, partial nudity and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Horrible visions of the future are a staple of movies, but the future vision depicted in “Ghost in the Shell,” based on the Japanese comic book, is more dispiriting than most because it’s more than plausible. It’s practically inevitable. While watching, the question that keeps crossing the mind is how do we prevent this? But the question has no answer.The movie’s title refers to a situation in which a human spirit is housed in a synthetic body. In “Ghost in the Shell,” most human beings are no longer entirely human but combinations of flesh and machine. There are replacement limbs and replacement eyes, of course, but there are also brain enhancements, such as chips that allow a person to learn French in one minute. Scarlett Johansson plays the ultimate end product of this process — a human brain housed in a completely synthetic, humanlike body. The existence of such an individual has implications that touch all aspects of life. What is a human being? What is a human spirit? Who owns the life-giving technology, and how can it be abused? “Ghost in the Shell” devises plenty of reasons for action scenes, most of them good reasons, but the action doesn’t overwhelm it. This is a thoughtful movie that’s interesting now and will probably still be interesting in 100 years, whichever way things go.Directed by Rupert Sanders (“Snow White and the Huntsman”), it takes place in what seems like a futuristic Tokyo, in which the skyline is filled not only with buildings but also with weird building-size holographs — ominous, smiling figures that are probably advertisements. Throughout there is a sense of a squalid, frenetic world in which monstrous businesses are in a constant effort to sell things, even though hardly anybody has any money.As a cyborg, Major (Johansson) has been designed to fight terrorism. She is essentially a supercharged cop, in possession of great speed and powers of climbing and leaping. She works directly under a government minister played by Takeshi Kitano, the action star and director. And for routine maintenance, repairs and downloads, she sees the scientist who helped create her, Dr. Ouélet (Juliette Binoche), who takes a personal interest in her welfare.For Johansson, “Ghost in the Shell” isn’t much of an acting challenge, except perhaps as a physical role. The movie calls for her to be mostly in a state of confusion or dim apprehension, but she helps serve up scenes for others. Even if you don’t know Kitano’s pedigree as one of the world’s greatest action stars, you can tell just from his quizzical and assured expression that sooner or later he will explode. Binoche brings an arresting quality to her role — a reassuring serenity with an undertone of anxiety, as if questioning the moral underpinnings of her life, her work and her world.  One of the best scenes in the entire film is a quiet interlude between a fairly blank Major and a motherly Japanese woman who spontaneously invites her in for tea. Something about the performance of the actress, Kaori Momoi, is extraordinary. Though performing in a language she can barely speak, she brings to the scene a complicated dynamic in which several things seem to be happening at once, all of it beneath the surface. Yet oddly, about a third of the way into “Ghost in the Shell,” it seems as if it might derail. After giving us a character whose very existence presents a fascinating moral proposition, the movie seems to shift gears. It stops focusing on the world of the film and starts concentrating on more garden-variety issues such as deception and betrayal. But the movie is more deft than you might expect, and this unwelcome detour ultimately turns into a way for the filmmakers to dig deeper into the movie’s real issues, such as what is life and what it all means.“Ghost in the Shell” is like an amalgam of 2017 anxieties. Fear of technology. Fear of big business. Fear of being spied upon. Fear of the sacred disappearing and of the crass, the loud and the empty crowding into every corner of existence — crowding out life itself. But the movie doesn’t just exploit these fears. It communicates an idea that may turn out to be important, that sooner or later, we as a species are going to have to decide about the limits of technology. And the limit may have to be the human brain.",1
"Horror thriller. Starring Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Arlen Escarpeta and Miles Fisher. Directed by Steven Quale. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Death doesn't like to be cheated, so following the miraculous escape of eight people from a suspension-bridge disaster ... things start happening. These things that happen? Oh, they're bad, but not just bad. They are elaborate and obliterating and unsettling and extremely funny, so that audiences end up laughing, yelling and gasping at the same time. It's a startled, ridiculous sound that people make, and you will make it about 10 ten times yourself if you go see Final Destination 5. What else is there to say? Wait, let me look at my notes. Great when the car lands on her head. Indeed, yes, that was one of many highlights, when the car lands on the woman's head. Not good for the car, not good for the woman, don't try this at home. What a strange thing this is. Final Destination 5 is irresistible, and the reason it's irresistible is that it speaks to us in the language we all understand, which is fear. If eternal beings came to earth and watched Final Destination 5, they would see it as a curious documentary. Only if they watched it with a human audience would they be moved, and then only by the audience, because people go nuts for this. This is a comedy about death. The movie makes audiences omniscient and above it all, and yet awakens them to their vulnerability, forcing them to see the danger in everything. It's funny and appalling, the most obvious schlock, and yet so effective that there's no point arguing with it.  The formula - it's not broke, why fix it? - is by now familiar. A group of young people gets on a transportation vehicle, in this case a bus heading toward an employee retreat. Everything seems to be going routinely, and then Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) observes that the suspension bridge they're on has begun to collapse, which is not a good thing. He runs off the bus and others follow, and over the ensuing five minutes, we're treated to a spectacular disaster, with cars tumbling into the sea and individual characters getting killed in gruesome and spectacular ways. But wait. That was just a vision, a premonition of the immediate future. Now, with a warning of 30 seconds to a minute, Sam jumps up and leads a party off the bus, this time in reality. This means we get to see the bridge collapse again - just as vivid, from another angle. And we have a group of survivors, each of whom are available to be killed again. You see, they were meant to be on that bridge, and so it's just a matter of time before ... death catches up. The rest is a game played between the movie and the audience. The movie tells us who is going to be killed, in what order. In a sense, the filmmakers tie one hand behind their back and say, We're going to surprise you any second now. You just don't know when or how. The scene in which a young gymnast goes through a routine is a beautiful example of successful comic suspense. The movie sets up a number of ways in which she might be killed and still shocks. Being the fifth installment in the Final Destination, this means that people or persons are getting enormously rich from this, but that's only right. Inventions like the light bulb and the phonograph are a lot easier to respect, but there is a place for more humble creations, like the Frappuccino and the Final Destination series, which do absolutely nothing except liven up the day.",1
"House of Wax: Horror. Starring Elisha Cuthbert, Jared Padalecki and Paris Hilton. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. (R. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yes, it's sensationalist, silly entertainment meant for a young audience, but everyone knows that going in. And yes, its dialogue is stilted, its characters undelineated and their motivations ridiculous. After a month, no one will talk about this movie, ever again. Still, with a picture like this, there's really only one question: Is it any fun? Yes. Lots. Definitely. For a good long while, nothing really happens, except a mood is created. Two carloads of hapless college-age people are on the way to some sporting event and decide to stop in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, to camp out. They're not even in a campground. It's more like a bleak, vacant lot. The experience of a thousand other movies suggests that such a boneheaded move would be good for two corpses, at least. But no. All in good time. When one of the cars develops engine trouble, the rest of the travel party continues on, while Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and her boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki), stay and try to get the car fixed. (MISTAKE!) They stumble into an old town, with a modest town square and one prominent structure, a wax museum called the House of Wax that is actually ... made of wax! House of Wax shares its title with a 1953 film starring Vincent Price, which through sheer willpower and a decent respect for the preciousness of time, I have managed not to see. But I understand the new one has nothing to do with the 1953 one. It also has very little connecting it to the grand progenitor of the wax- horror subgenre, the early Technicolor The Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), though Charles Belden (1904-1954), who got a story credit 72 years ago, gets another one here. The one point of connection is the notion of someone being so crazy as to make wax statues out of real, living bodies. They tried that on Fay Wray in the original, and she was so good at screaming that they cast her in King Kong. House of Wax doesn't lose its hold on the viewer once its mystery is revealed. On the contrary, it opens up into a situation of protracted, unrelenting tension over a fairly wide set of locations. Elisha Cuthbert's matter-of-fact, likable quality helps. Seeing her turn into wax would be as bad as seeing that happen to Glenda Farrell (the star of the 1933 version). The film is also enlivened by the director's willingness to be appalling -- not disgusting, which is cheap -- but shockingly grim and awful. Speaking of shockingly grim and awful, Paris Hilton has a supporting role, as the heroine's best friend. Her presence is innocuous enough, until she does a misguided striptease about three-quarters into the movie that puts every other crime committed in House of Wax into sudden perspective. -- Advisory: Graphic violence, blood, gore, terror and sexual situations.

"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days: Romantic comedy. Starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. Directed by Donald Petrie. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture benefits enormously from the casting of Kate Hudson, who already at 23 is a nimble and confident comic actress; and from the presence of Matthew McConaughey, who almost gets as many laughs as Hudson playing it straight. Though at times individual moments fall flat and allowances have to be made for the dialogue, the picture's comic structure is so impregnable that the comedy can't sink. Hudson plays Andie, a how to columnist for a women's magazine who gets the idea to write an article about all the mistakes women make in their relationships with men. To give the article extra color, she decides to find a guy, get a relationship going and then demolish it within 10 days by acting pushy, clingy and neurotic. Through a series of complications not worth going into, she ends up choosing for her experiment an advertising man (McConaughey) who has bet his boss that he can find a woman and make her fall in love with him within 10 days. So there it is, a perfect comic situation: She tries to drive him crazy, and he is willing to put up with anything to win the bet -- and neither knows what the other is up to. The movie doesn't get good until the relationship starts going bad. The first date, in which everything supposedly goes well, is like watching a mating dance between two very good-looking, self-satisfied imbeciles. But then Andie begins her campaign to sabotage things -- calling him at work, asking what he's thinking and badgering him about past girlfriends. At one point she bursts into tears in a restaurant and tells the waitress, My boyfriend thinks I'm fat, and I can't eat in front of him. Hudson flings herself into the glorious silliness of playing a woman pretending to be the kind of lunatic who, on a third date, might show up at a man's apartment with an album full of photos showing what their future children might look like. It's just as fun to watch McConaughey's bemused reactions as he tries to figure out this woman who seems beautiful and confident one minute and a crack-enhanced Kathie Lee Gifford the next. Just as he contemplates Andie, the audience contemplates Hudson, who is almost irresistible but isn't quite. She may be adorable, but her demeanor suggests that she not only knows it but has a precocious expertise in the cold mechanics of adorableness -- pulling out adorable smile No. 1, tossing out adorable look No. 3. Still, she can act when she needs to, and is the most likely candidate around to enter the romantic-comedy likable-blonde pantheon that includes Marion Davies, Carole Lombard, Goldie Hawn (Hudson's mother) and Meg Ryan. Still, there's one strange thing about How to Lose a Guy that needs to be mentioned, stranger still because it hardly seems so until one thinks of it. Andie's dilemma is that this is the man of her dreams, and yet she needs to kill the romance at the outset for the sake of an article. Not a job. One article. Sixty years ago, women would give up their jobs at the end of movies in order to marry some loser, and that was crazy. But was that any crazier than this? Today we see How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days as a jolly farce, but the future could just as easily look upon it as the bizarre product of an age that valued worldly success above everything else. . This film contains sexual situations. ",1
"Hunter Thompson was a significant figure in American journalism and a colorful presence in popular culture, and he gets the documentary he deserves in Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. The film is thorough and entertaining. It's enthusiastic about his contributions, but it's no hagiography, and it serves as both a celebration and a cautionary tale.Indeed, there are so many lessons, professional pointers and observations to be gleaned about writing and living from watching this story that it might be best to take these points one at time: 1. How to be a journalist: Most kids who imitate Thompson - those who want to be new journalists - go in for flashy writing. That's fine. But successful New Journalism combines idiosyncratic, personal observation with old-fashioned foot work. Thompson wrote about the Hells Angels only after riding with them for a year. He wrote about the 1972 presidential campaign after spending a year following George McGovern around. He worked hard, at least in the beginning. New Journalism is real journalism.2. How not to be a journalist: Making yourself part of the story can be a good thing. Making yourself the whole story is a mistake, and there's a thin membrane between the two approaches. Thompson crossed it when he had the arrogance to get drunk and go swimming rather than attend the Ali-Foreman fight, even though he was assigned to cover it. Arrogance in a writer is like dynamite, a necessary substance but one that, if handled improperly, will inevitably blow the writer up, sometimes for good.3. Fame is dangerous: It can ruin a journalist as easily as it can ruin an artist, and Thompson, who was essentially both, was definitely damaged by it. Though Thompson complained about fame, he embraced it. He played a version of himself on the world stage, and the minute he started doing that, his best work was behind him.4. You want to write? Avoid drugs and alcohol: Sure, drugs and alcohol fueled a few incandescent years for Thompson, but once it's admitted that Thompson was good because he was a good writer and not because he was a substance abuser, the ways in which his habits cut short his creative period become clear.Beyond the obvious, that drugs and alcohol sucked his vitality and damaged his health, those substances also pickled him in a set of ideas and attitudes that he'd developed as a young man. What comes through between the lines of Gonzo is that Thompson didn't grow as a thinker or as a writer. His preoccupation with the death of the American dream, which was at the heart of his important work, became the reflexive prism through which he interpreted everything. It's ironic that the man who foretold the end of 1960s idealism should have been so frozen in the attitudes of that period. Was it drugs? Was it fame? Was it the drug of fame mixing with the other drugs and alcohol? Whatever it was, Thompson remained, at heart, a self-protective sentimentalist, with a tendency to fall in love and fall in hate with great intensity, all with the borderline irrationality of an adolescent. It's an ironic thing about adolescent absolutism in a mature person: It makes a fellow seem much older than he is, as if he hasn't bothered to have a second thought in years.Looking back, it's hard to believe that in the mid-1980s, when Thompson was writing his column in the San Francisco Examiner - still railing about Nixon, who'd been driven from office a dozen years earlier - he was only in his late 40s. Those should have been Thompson's prime years, or rather the beginning of his prime. Instead he wrote like a talented relic. Again, kids: Don't do drugs.Finally, in 2005, Thompson took the Hemingway way out, with a shotgun, following the example of another exceptional writer who was brilliant in his youth, lived too long as a legend and eventually chose suicide. The various talking heads have different interpretations of Thompson's final act, some seeing it as an act of courage, others as an act of cowardice. His first wife sees it as cowardice, and she makes a good case. But the nice thing about this movie - directed by Alex Gibney (Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, Taxi to the Dark Side) - is that you can see it in any number of ways. Everything you've read here just tells you how I saw it. There are other ways of seeing it, equally satisfying, to be sure, and all of them testimonies to the compelling nature of this life and the virtues of a fine documentary. -- Advisory: Drug use, nudity, strong language.Gonzo:The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S.

"Hustle & Flow: Drama. Starring Terrence Howard, Taraji P. Henson, Anthony Andersonand DJ Qualls. Directed by Craig Brewer. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) This is sincere, old-fashioned acting that owes its strength to an absolute conviction that people's emotional yearnings are not to be laughed at, that these yearnings are the place where people really live, and that that place is a source of dignity. Stand back and the character Howard plays is almost ridiculous -- a small-time pimp and drug dealer who dreams of becoming a hip-hop star -- but there's no standing back. Howard draws us in immediately, by somehow suggesting, through his essence, that this seemingly unsavory man, despite not having one aspect of his environment to strengthen it, has a natural goodness about him. He plays DJay, a Memphis hustler whose world consists of a couple of prostitutes, a pregnant girlfriend and a beat-up Chevy, without air conditioning, in which he sits most of the day peddling his little blond hooker (Taryn Manning). Not surprisingly, he wants more out of life -- not more money but more meaning. The national success of a Memphis rapper named Skinny Black (Chris Ludacris Bridges) makes him start thinking of hip-hop as a possible ticket out. And a chance meeting with an old high school friend, a sound engineer (Anthony Anderson), gets things in motion. Craig Brewer, who wrote and directed, lingers over the settings -- the boarded-up and beat-up buildings, the single-level dilapidated homes and the seedy nightclub where DJay discusses his dreams with the owner (Isaac Hayes) in a tired drawl. Sometimes scenes are punctuated by a train whistle, that peculiarly American sound that has inspired scores of country songs and has become sonic shorthand for frustrated ambition in movies, all the way from Joan Crawford in Possessed (1931) on up through 8 Mile. It's the sound of standing still while other people go places. Brewer's script has obvious potential pitfalls -- sentimentality and cliche being the big ones -- but he directs around them. In fact, the general excellence of the ensemble must be credited in part to Brewer. Take Manning as the prostitute. She's a truck-stop lizard, but Manning plays her with no self-pity. When she ultimately expresses dismay, it's not that her life is so hideous but that she doesn't have any meaningful work. She craves usefulness most of all and seems to relish her function in the studio as the girl who gets to turn off the fan before the recording starts. But then everybody in the movie wants something deep and fulfilling. Throughout, people say things like This can't be it for me, and My life's not over yet. Hip-hop might be the music of youthful rebellion, but the words in Hustle & Flow have more to do with a midlife crisis: You know it's hard out here for a pimp ... Every studio scene is irresistible. It's amazing how a great hip-hop song can be synthesized with no one actually playing an instrument. There's also a riveting extended scene, between DJay and Skinny Black, which goes in at least three directions before resolving in a way that's unexpected and yet, in retrospect, inevitable. But more than the individual scenes, audiences will take from Hustle & Flow a memory of the performances. As DJay's pregnant girlfriend, Taraji P. Henson is lushly beautiful and complete in her embrace of her frankly romantic role -- and she's not the only actor to give herself in this wholehearted way. So much love went into Hustle & Flow that it almost glows with it. -- Advisory: Violence, sexual situations and harsh language. ",1
"I AM SAM: Drama. Starring Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Jessie Nelson. (PG-13. 133 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Penn doesn't compromise, and the script never forces him to. He plays a grown man with the IQ of a 7-year-old. Sam is not a savant. The soundtrack contains modern covers of old Beatles songs, but no one, thankfully, sings Fool on the Hill. Penn never presents Sam's severe retardation as a form of wisdom in disguise, although, in a couple of moments, the movie seems about to head in that direction. Instead, it stays honest: Sam doesn't know more because he's retarded. He knows less. It's always interesting to watch a good actor thinking in a close-up, but here it's particularly fascinating. As Sam, Penn thinks with all his might -- and moves very slowly. Sometimes, when he talks, we can see the moment where his thoughts go off track and he becomes lost. At other times, we see him struggling to find the words to express a complicated feeling. Early in the movie, there is a quiet moment when his daughter (Dakota Fanning), whom he is raising alone, asks him why he is not like other kids' daddies. She has reached the age at which she can tell the difference, and a wonderful look of dawning uncertainty moves across Penn's face. He has worried about this moment. The story of I Am Sam centers on a court case. The county decides that Sam is incapable of raising his daughter and takes her away from him. Sam, with incredible luck, manages to get himself a high-powered attorney, played by Michelle Pfeiffer as a beautifully coiffed, over-caffeinated type-triple-A train wreck. The litigation goes on for the length of the movie, but I Am Sam is no Philadelphia, in which one side is clearly right and the other wrong. Instead, I Am Sam does two important things. It makes it absolutely clear that Sam is a loving father. Penn's scenes with Fanning -- who is bright, big- eyed and adorable -- are touching in the way Sam so easily connects with a child's mind. He's like a real-live teddy bear. At the same time, the movie makes it absolutely unclear whether Sam really is capable of adequately raising this child through adolescence and into adulthood. I Am Sam is not about the justice or injustice of the legal system. Rather it's about the tragedy of Sam's predicament. By refusing to make the social workers into villains, and by never succumbing to the temptation to give Sam an improbable moment of lucidity or insight, the filmmakers avoid two obvious traps. But they put themselves into a less obvious trap with regard to plot. Sam is never going to change. So any plot motion has to come from another character. Two-thirds of the way in, I Am Sam comes to a standstill. Desperate for forward motion of any kind, the movie starts concentrating on the relationship between the hard-driving attorney and Sam. The idea is that somehow, just by being in contact with Sam's loving nature, the attorney is forced to confront the shallowness of her existence. It's the script's one blast of insincerity, but it's a big one, and Pfeiffer has the burden of trying to carry it off. In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It's hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material. Most of the last part of I Am Sam is made up of inconclusive scenes, followed by long and overused musical interludes featuring Beatles songs. Yet just when I Am Sam seems about ready to descend into the very stickiness and sentimentality it had managed to avoid, the movie rescues itself -- by knowing when to end. Director Jessie Nelson has made a stylish picture from a screenplay she wrote with Kristine Johnson. In moments of tension, she uses a staccato zoom effect -- moving in on actors' faces in abrupt increments. It creates an unsettled quality. Yet more impressive is her handling of the court scenes, in which she gives us a peek into Sam's childlike perspective by showing us how he sees the proceedings. ",1
"I ♥ Huckabees: Comedy. Starring Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Mark Wahlberg, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law and Naomi Watts. Directed by David O. Russell. R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To explain the movie accurately is, inevitably, to sound vague. Like the characters, director and co-writer David O. Russell (Three Kings) is flailing in search of meaning. He grabs at everything and sometimes comes up empty. But to write off Huckabees as a mishmash of zany characters and half- thought ideas would be wrong. This is a high dive into the creative waterfall, a risky, foolish, intelligent comedy that acknowledges, with neither irony nor mawkishness, the spiritual pain of living in these times. Huckabees, the film's central metaphor, is a discount department store that is rapidly expanding and doing its part to turn America into a strip mall. Little girls in Third World countries, we're told, go blind working in factories in order to supply Huckabees' production line. To shop at Huckabees is to blind oneself to injustice. Thus, average people are faced with an unattractive choice. They can know the truth and live in a state of paranoia, guilt and paralysis. Or, they can choose ignorance and exist inside a bright lie that would almost be perfect, if only it were a little more convincing. The action of the film involves an effort by an environmentalist group, led by a young activist, Albert (Jason Schwartzman), to prevent Huckabees from expanding into a nearby marsh. It also involves an investigation of a more personal nature. Albert hires a pair of existential detectives -- played by Lily Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman -- to follow him around and diagnose his emotional ills. He doesn't quite know what his problem is, but he knows something is wrong. Hoffman and Tomlin are a delight. He is deadpan and reassuring, tough love in a 1960s Sonny Bono haircut, and Tomlin is infinitely peaceful to the point that one suspects she must be crazy. They preach the interconnectedness of all things: We are all one, and so whatever happens is OK. Their nemesis is Caterine, a cool French nihilist played with deadpan aplomb by Isabelle Huppert. She teaches that nothing is connected to anything and that life is simply chaos. A firefighter with post-Sept. 11 stress comes under Caterine's spell, and next thing he knows he's obsessing about the effects of petroleum. As played by Mark Wahlberg, the firefighter exudes a visceral suffering bordering on a kind of madness. Burly and bewildered, he's a simple guy thrust into the deep waters of the spirit and its disorders. Wahlberg, essentially playing America's troubled soul, is perfect in his part and assured of his tone. What the firefighter knows is what the other characters find out: Sooner or later, something cataclysmic happens to make people search for deeper answers. Jude Law as Brad, the golden boy Huckabees executive who poses as an environmentalist, seems to have an enviable life, with a nice house and a girlfriend, Dawn (Naomi Watts), who's the company's national spokeswoman. But Dawn's inner life is nothing but an infantile wail of need, and the two are like children. The shiny surface masks a loveless relationship between two beautiful narcissists frozen with fear. At times the movie's message seems to be that if people follow their feelings, a healing will follow, for themselves and the universe. But Huckabees is more complicated than that. In fact, watching it is rather like being trapped in a fugue of contradictory thoughts and concerns. Thematically, the movie remains unresolved, but perhaps for that reason, it's haunting, and in any case, the search is honest. For example, the movie introduces a Sudanese refugee who works as a doorman in America. To him, Huckabees is a paradise. In his way, he's right. So it doesn't really matter if I ♥ Huckabees doesn't quite hit the bull's-eye. There's ambition here, as well as a shaggy brilliance and a rare willingness on the part of a director to work out his questions in front of us, on film. Russell trusts the striving for meaning, and he trusts that others will find it interesting. His trust is not misplaced. -- Advisory: Strong language and a sex scene. ",1
"I, Robot: Action. Starring Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Alex Proyas. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Proyas, Smith and the movie's compelling situation -- robots are going bad in the robot-infested Chicago of 2035 -- are enough to make I, Robot seem like more than a likable diversion, at least for the first hour. Few directors can match Proyas (Dark City) in his ability to make futuristic urban landscapes look gritty and tangible, and the world he creates in I, Robot seems like the setting for an important film. Unfortunately, the screenplay, which is only loosely based on Isaac Asimov's I, Robot stories, gradually reveals itself as trivial in comparison -- not bad, not ridiculous, just small in spirit and lacking in importance. It's still good enough to keep things moving, to supply Smith with one- liners and to provide an excuse for the compelling backdrop. Smith plays Spooner, a Chicago homicide officer with an affection for old things. His stereo is early 21st century. He listens to Stevie Wonder and wears Converse All-Stars from 2004. He doesn't like robots, even though they're everywhere, working not just as domestic appliances but also in most of the service professions -- in sanitation, package delivery and bartending, just to name three. It's a wonder that any human still has a job. A mystery plot, of sorts, kicks in with the apparent suicide of Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell), a pioneer in the development of robotics. Spooner is sent to investigate, which puts him into contact with Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), the head of the robotics company that is about to roll out its new model. Spooner thinks a robot may have killed Lanning, which is exactly the kind of publicity Robertson doesn't need, with a robot from his company already scheduled for delivery in every household in America. What's eerie and intriguing about I, Robot in these early minutes is that its premise isn't all that far-fetched. A future corporation could very well form a partnership with the government to provide robots for every household, and families would welcome a machine that could cook, clean, drive and relieve people of domestic drudgery. At the same time, with all the robots plugged into a central database, the potential for abuse would be staggering, especially if, as in I, Robot, the robots were stronger and more durable than people. In such circumstances, the placement of a robot in every home would be the same as placing a guard in every home. In one swoop, an entire populace could be held captive. Yet although I, Robot provokes thought, it doesn't exactly deliver thought, despite the occasional Cartesian reference to ghosts in the machine.  It delivers action, a series of sequences in which robots attack and try to kill our hero. A scene in a tunnel, in which two trucks full of robots jump on Spooner's car and try to make him crash, is typical: It's kinetic and attention-grabbing, but it looks a little fake. The computer-graphics nature of those robots can't be disguised. The movie does, however, boast a remarkable CGI creation in Sonny, a robot who thinks, dreams and has feelings. Watching him, it's hard to believe he was never physically on the set. Greenwood, a good actor, is underutilized, and Bridget Moynahan, as the robot psychiatrist who comes to share Spooner's suspicions, underplays her role. If she and Proyas decided that the character should be withdrawn and hesitant, it was an unadventurous choice. In the last third, the picture becomes an action frenzy and loses the human element, though it maintains interest. A particularly interesting moment comes when we hear the spokesman for the evil force explain its actions: Lives must be lost and some freedom sacrificed to maintain safety, we're told. Obviously, someone is trying to make a point with this, but it's not clear enough to register. -- Advisory: Lots of stylized, action violence. ",1
"ICE AGE: Animation. Starring the voices of John Leguizamo, Ray Romano and Denis Leary. Directed by Chris Wedge. (PG. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There is no over-caffeinated comedian on the soundtrack trying to get recognized as a comic genius by ad-libbing bad one-liners. In Ice Age, John Leguizamo is the voice of a sloth named Sid, but if Leguizamo did any improvising, it doesn't sound like it. This is not a movie about how clever the actors are. It's a movie about a sloth, a woolly mammoth and a saber- toothed tiger and their adventures 20,000 years ago. The challenge of any animation is to come up with a story that merits full- length treatment. Few do. All those movies, for example, about unlikely heroes who rise up and save the kingdom -- terrible. We know how those have to end before they start. Ice Age comes up with something different. The earth's climate changes are causing animals every- where to migrate to warmer regions. Sid the sloth begins his migration by offending a pair of rhinos, and so, for protection, he turns to a woolly mammoth named Manny (Ray Romano). No one messes with a woolly mammoth. The teaming of an annoying little guy with an impassive big guy might sound straight out of Shrek -- in that one, an ogre was paired with a wise- cracking donkey. But Ice Age introduces an extra element. An infant human child accidentally falls into the care of Sid and Manny, which brings a saber-toothed tiger into their orbit. The tiger has been assigned by his pack to kidnap the child. When the tiger joins Sid and Manny's migration, supposedly to help guide them to the infant's father, Ice Age develops a note of ambiguity and complex motivation unexpected in an animated film. The journey is a real journey. The characters grow. Relationships change. Hemingway once said that if you want to know whether a story works, take away all the fancy writing and see if there's still a story there. The same could be said for animation. Take away the pretty pictures, and the story of Ice Age would hold up. For an actor to act with just his voice is like acting with two hands and two legs, a head and a torso tied behind his back. Operating within those constraints, the tendency is to break loose and overdo it, but Romano, Leguizamo and especially Denis Leary, as the tiger, deliver performances of delicacy and nuance. Their talents are ably matched by the animation artists, who, by virtue of the story, must render drawing after drawing of characters between emotions, who aren't sure how they feel. This might be the first animated film in which close-ups function as they do in live action, as moments of quiet revelation. By now, audiences have come to expect animated films to be visually dazzling, and Ice Age holds up its end. The play of fur and hair is strikingly natural. There's lots of fluttering and zaniness in a scene involving dodo birds. (In their alarmist way, they're the only ones to comprehend fully the implications of the climate change.) A guaranteed crowd- pleaser is the opening sequence, in which a prehistoric squirrel, trying to bury an acorn in the ice, creates a fissure that races up and down mountains and starts an avalanche. Yet in a way, the most impressive use of animation comes in the scene in which the mammoth goes into a sad reverie while looking at a cave painting of a woolly mammoth family. We see Manny's recollection of his long-ago life as a family man, depicted in an animated sequence using the cave-painting figures. It's an imaginative way to communicate a back story that never needs to be stated or referred to, but which adds complication and richness to the character's motivations. Like any other animated movie, Ice Age has scenes that drag here and there, but clocking in at a lean 84 minutes, it doesn't wallow in any moments too long. The movie's subtly peculiar environmentalist sentiments are worth contemplating in those rare bland moments. For some reason Ice Age sympathizes with every kind of extinct animal but has little use for humankind. ",1
"ICE CUBE (as Calvin) cutting up while cutting hair in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures� ensemble comedy BARBERSHOP.  Photo by: Tracy Bennett (HANDOUT PHOTO) PLEASE VERIFY RIGHTS AND USAGEICE CUBE (as Calvin) cutting up while cutting hair in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures� ensemble comedy BARBERSHOP. Photo by: Tracy Bennett (HANDOUT PHOTO) PLEASE VERIFY RIGHTS AND USAGEBARBERSHOP: Comedy. Starring Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer. Directed by Tim Story. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Cube makes comedies for an urban audience, mixing outrageous humor with stories about fellows of modest means looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Sometimes Cube writes the screenplay. In Barbershop he just stars, but it's very much in the genre of Cube's homegrown efforts, Friday and Next Friday. That Ice Cube should have found his cinematic niche making comedies is surprising, since he usually looks like someone who just received the worst news of his life. But the seriousness can come in handy. In Barbershop he plays Calvin, who inherited a Chicago barbershop from his father. Calvin doesn't like cutting hair. His business is about to go under, and he needs money fast. All his get-rich-quick schemes have come to nothing. The comedy is set against this seemingly hopeless situation. There's no way out for Calvin, and yet he manages to make matters even worse for himself by selling the shop to the local crime boss and then going back on the deal. So he has creditors and a mobster (David Keith) after him, and he's the easiest guy in the world to find -- he's stuck behind a chair all day. For those who want to take Barbershop seriously -- and fortunately no one in the movie takes it seriously at all -- it's a picture that contrasts the bleakness of inner-city life with the resiliency of its people. In a sense, that's what Ice Cube's movies are always about. Here, as in the Friday movies, the jokes are big and rude and vulgar and very funny. Most of the best laughs come from inside the barbershop, which is presented as a makeshift community center, like a bar in an old Saroyan play. There's the upwardly mobile college student (Sean Patrick Thomas), the ex-con (Michael Ealy), the female barber (the rap star Eve) and the white barber who talks like a rapper (Troy Garity). Everybody gets on everybody else's nerves, but there's the sense that this is a kind of family. Best of all, there's the old-timer, Eddie, an old barber with no customers, who spends all day gassing about his opinions. As Eddie, Cedric the Entertainer is done up in intentionally ridiculous age makeup and has the funniest monologues. His bits about the true historical significance of Rosa Parks and the three things black people need to admit will have audiences laughing out loud. The picture also has a comic subplot, with lots of sight gags, involving two imbeciles (played by Anthony Anderson and Lahmard Tate) who steal an ATM and then find themselves lugging it all around Chicago, futilely trying to open it and looking for a place to stash it. As directed by Tim Story, Barbershop is a clumsy film, and in a couple of stretches, it seems to stand still. The screenplay doesn't quite succeed in its intent to present the barbershop as a glorious place where humanity intersects and people leave enriched. But it almost succeeds, and the big laughs go a long way toward picking up the slack. Anyway, a sloppy but likable movie beats a meticulous but flat one every time. . Contains coarse language and sexual content. ",1
"INSOMNIA: Drama. Starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Directed by Christopher Nolan. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Those of us who love the manic, flailing side of Pacino, who enjoy him yelling anything (except hoo-hah), might therefore be disappointed by the actor's weary demeanor throughout his new movie, at least at first. Not only does he do no screaming, but he also doesn't have a single moment of suppressed, pent-up, teeth-grinding rage. (They pull me back in.) But stick with Insomnia. Christopher Nolan's intelligent and penetrating direction brings out a new side of Pacino. Along the way, Nolan also gives us a new Robin Williams and a transformed Hilary Swank. Directing his first big- budget Hollywood movie, Nolan (Memento) controls every nuance of the emotional temperature. The result is something more than an effective thriller. Insomnia is a haunting psychological drama. Pacino is tired even as the movie starts. He plays a Los Angeles homicide detective named Dormer, who is sent with his partner (Martin Donovan) to a remote Alaskan village to look into the bludgeoning death of a high school girl. Pacino gives the character a bone-tired life weariness. The heavy things he's seen have put bags under his eyes. He's so exhausted, he can barely manage a smile for the chipper local cop (Swank) assigned to be his assistant. From the movie's opening moments, as Pacino's propeller plane wings its way over mountains of green ice, we understand that we're entering a landscape both beautiful and eerie. Here the sun doesn't set in summer, which is really bad for the detective, since he's staying in the one hotel in the universe that doesn't have blackout shades. Even before he has something to feel guilty about, he can't sleep, and after the next day -- after he accidentally kills somebody -- there's little hope he'll sleep again. Pacino is not usually a less is more type of actor, but we see the strategy begin to pay off early in Insomnia. After a shootout in thick fog, he approaches what he thinks will be the corpse of a murder suspect. Instead he finds that he has just shot his partner. His face barely registers a reaction and yet suggests a range of complex possibilities. By not giving the viewers what they expect, he makes them think. From there, Insomnia becomes the story of two cases -- the murder under investigation and the killing that the detective hopes will remain unsolved. Swank, who came across as rather chilly in The Affair of the Necklace, emerges as a fresh and engaging actress. She nicely calibrates the character's change in attitude toward the detective, from hero worship to distress to suspicion. To a large degree, we understand how the detective is being perceived by watching Swank. Robin Williams enters the film midway as a creepy villain, and it's striking to see how Williams' facial features, which generally register as benevolent, can suddenly strike the eye as distorted. By acting perverse, Williams makes us see him as perverse -- his chin looks bigger, like that of a goblin. One of the pleasures of the movie is watching Williams and Pacino act together. Williams plays the villain as emotionally needy, trying his best to sound reasonable and almost believing his own act, while Pacino plays the detective as so sleep-deprived he can't be bothered to conceal his disdain. You're my job, Pacino says in a hoarse voice. You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet to a plumber. You're the same distorted freak I've been dealing with for 30 years. Thirty years of distorted freaks -- Pacino makes the audience feel every year of it. It takes nothing away from Swank and Williams to say that Insomnia represents a Pacino tour de force. In addition to rising to a number of powerful scenes (including one in which he has to call the wife of his dead partner and give the bad news), he has to render the progressive mental and physical deterioration that comes of sleep deprivation. He does it expertly. The traditional time for guilty crackups, from Lady Macbeth on down, has always been nighttime, when it's dark and people are alone. Insomnia shows how a sunny night can be even worse on a conscience than darkness, making a person feel as though he's done something so wrong that heaven's floodlight just won't go out. There are moments in Insomnia when the sameness of the emotional landscape becomes as wearying as the constant sunshine, but that isn't a damning flaw, and in any case it was probably Nolan's intention. Here, as in Memento, the director shows how film bright can be as dramatic, oppressive and revealing as film noir. ",1
"If at the end of “American Sniper,” you feel less than moved by the title character’s exploits — if the whole enterprise leaves you with a strange, hard-to-define feeling — don’t think that’s an accident. Clint Eastwood has made a sneaky, complicated film that takes the form of a rousing war movie but whose ideas are almost subversive, or at least too provocative to state overtly.For that reason, “American Sniper” is bound to be misunderstood even by those who admire it. And it will definitely be misunderstood by people who don’t like it, who might wonder why they didn’t walk out inspired by the story of a real American hero. Well, the clue is in the title. Not “American Hero,” but “American Sniper.”What Eastwood is saying with this film is that sometimes what we call heroism isn’t defined by the presence of something, such as courage or a sense of purpose. Sometimes it’s the result of an absence of something, such as the capacity for introspection or real empathy. At the same time, Eastwood is realist enough to know that, if you’re going to fight a war, you don’t want Hamlet standing next to you. In some contexts, limitation can be a strength.The movie is based on the memoir of the same name by Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL and the most lethal sniper in American history, with some 160 confirmed kills. He became known as the Legend. The movie tells his story, from his childhood in Odessa, Texas, through his decision to join the SEALs and through several tours of duty in Iraq.Bradley Cooper, who bulked up for the role, also changed his demeanor, from urban and mercurial to rural and steady. He plays Kyle as not smart, but not stupid, either; as someone who sees his path to distinction as doing exactly what he’s told but doing it better than anybody else. Later, Cooper also suggests depths to Kyle that he doesn’t see himself, that beneath the surface of this simple, bottled-up guy, there is pain and rage that he can never face.Eastwood throws audiences right into the battle scenes. As a sniper, Kyle sits safe, above the action, but there is still a lot of stress involved. He must constantly make life-and-death decisions. He must decide if a mother carrying a baby is about to throw a hand grenade. He must decide if a child walking up to a group of Marines is just a harmless kid or a suicide bomber.Still, though shooting at people is intense, getting shot at is worse, and the scene in which Kyle and a group of men are pinned down by sniper fire brings out the best in Eastwood. He keeps us in the heart of the action by showing us only what Kyle can see, while he reminds us that what’s happening to Kyle is the same thing he does to other people all the time. Of course, Kyle might dismiss his foes as “savages” whose lives don’t matter, but that doesn’t mean the director agrees. He almost certainly doesn’t.Incidentally, if anybody thinks I’m reading this complexity into Eastwood’s intentions — if anybody thinks of Clint Eastwood as an uncomplicated old fellow who has conversations with chairs and who sees moral issues in black and white — forget it. This is the same director who took a nuanced view of Iwo Jima, and who made two films about that battle just to do justice to both points of view.In between combat scenes, “American Sniper” abruptly cuts to Kyle at home, between deployments. His wife (Sienna Miller) asks him to open up and talk to her, but he keeps saying he has nothing to say until we believe him, even if she doesn’t. By the time she tells him, “I need you to be human again,” the unspoken question hangs in the air: Was he ever?In “American Sniper,” Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall have made as good a film as could be made from the substance of Kyle’s life and career. But greatness was never a possibility, not with a protagonist not all that interesting and with the surrounding circumstances making it impossible to go deeper and risk the movie’s critique of Kyle’s becoming overt. Even so, the big guy comes away with a shrewd and very well-made picture.",1
"If you have to get bad news, at least have Noam Chomsky deliver it. His views on the state of the country and where the economy is heading might lead another person to despair or anger. Instead, Chomsky is measured and thoughtful, even as he looks deep into the past and far into the future and sees little but exploitation, misery and possible civic chaos.“Requiem for the American Dream” is an inventively staged and illustrated interview with Chomsky, a leftist theorist known for his critiques of American foreign policy. Here the subject is the growing gap between rich and poor and the shrinking of the middle class. It’s about people working longer and harder, while getting less, about the disappearance of unions, and about globalization, which has killed off most of the high-wage jobs for unskilled labor.The movie was filmed over the course of several years, and yet it pretty much anticipates everything that has been fueling this crazy election year, with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders becoming the vehicles for working-class anger. These are extreme opposite approaches, but they indicate that a sizable percentage of the electorate is in pain and getting restless.Chomsky’s thesis is that a tiny minority of powerful interests are rigging the economy and the political system in their own favor by buying candidates and pushing for friendly legislation. Over the course of the 73-minute film, he calmly lists and explains 10 ways by which the powerful manipulate and control the debate in the United States. To his credit, he doesn’t assert some overarching conspiracy. Rather he talks about the tendencies of power, almost as though they were organic entities with built-in modes of response. Most interestingly, Chomsky cites precedents going back to Adam Smith and beyond. These are historical tendencies, struggles that come in waves and take decades to form. The robber barons of the Gilded Age led to the union movement of the early 20th century, which led to high corporate taxes in midcentury ... before the reaction set in and things slowly began to shift the other way. More than 30 years separated the Taft-Hartley Bill and President Ronald Reagan’s decision to fire the striking air-traffic controllers, but they were two events in a tide that is still rising. Strangely — or perhaps not so strangely, as it deals with issues of survival — “Requiem for the American Dream” is an entertaining film. Few will agree with every word spoken, but Chomsky’s vision of history is worth encountering and considering.",1
"Imaginary Heroes: Drama. Starring Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Dan Harris. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To put it in another way, there's a lean, mean 82-minute drama encased in this flabby 112-minute film. As it stands, it's possible at different points to go into a waking trance while watching it, the way one does on long driving trips, only to snap back minutes later to find that nothing has happened. Two teenagers will be talking about life. Minutes later, they will still be talking about life. If there's something less interesting than a pair of teenagers smoking pot and ruminating about existence, it's hard to imagine what that might be. What saves Imaginary Heroes is its essential truthfulness about families, which it reveals, not only in the broad movements of its story but in the small details. For example, a father, played by Jeff Daniels, grieving and guilt-ridden over his son's suicide, takes to passing each evening in his car, listening to the radio. That's specific and odd enough to have the ring of truth. There's even a touch of poetry in the image of a man who can't stand to be in his own house, walling himself off from every contact and every physical reminder of his misery. The performances are also of high quality, starting with Emile Hirsch, who plays Tim, the younger brother of a gifted swimming star. One fine day, young Tim, stunned, walks into the kitchen tracking something on his shoes. His mother starts to complain, then realizes that her son is in shock and that the substance on his shoes is blood. It's an economical way of communicating the catalytic event of Imaginary Heroes: The older brother -- his father's pride and joy -- has blown his brains out. For the father, who believed his son was destined for an Olympic gold medal, the son's suicide is the death of every cherished vision of the future. It's also a rebuke and a source of guilt, since his late son hated swimming and did it only to please him. For the mother -- played by Sigourney Weaver -- the son's death is not the only source of grief. There's also the loss of her marriage, which was probably suffering to begin with, but which soon becomes unbearable, when her husband retreats into an angry bitterness and starts acting bizarre, insisting, for example, that a plate (with food) be put out for the dead son at every meal. Mainly, the picture follows Tim, who goes through life with the painful awareness of being the lesser son, whose presence is no consolation for the grieving father, and whose continued existence, in fact, might even be an annoyance. Tim retreats into his music -- he can play the piano -- and into his relationships with friends. Most of all, he benefits from a healthy relationship with his mother, who, though she's screwed up in some ways herself, understands him and offers the kind of unconditional love that his father is incapable of. If the brother was dad's favorite, Tim is mom's favorite, and the difference between mom and dad on that score might, in fact, be the determining factor between one son's life and the other's death. That mother-son bond, seemingly casual and glancing but really nourishing and deep, is convincingly rendered by Hirsch and Weaver. Imaginary Heroes takes place over the course of a year, checking in with Tim, his college-age sister (Michelle Williams) and his parents, as they maneuver, together and separately, under a black cloud of grief that informs every contact. Sometimes the film's tone wobbles into farce, which is inappropriate, and often the story treads water, as though mimicking, in tone, every somber family film since Ordinary People. But, ultimately, it arrives at an authentic and surprisingly powerful place. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, strong language and drug use. ",1
"Imagine living in a world in which everyone you know is an idiot, including every single person in authority, every boss, every cop, even your mother and grandmother. And then imagine that all those tragically, achingly stupid people are convinced that they know everything and they can’t wait to tell you just how stupid you are.Imagine, further, that within this world you’re brilliant. You have poetry in your soul. You have dreams, talent and spirit, but you have no power, and everything that you see — every street corner, every building, every landscape — is repulsive. And then imagine that no one takes you seriously, that everybody is saying that you’re fat or that you’re worthless, or both. So you want to get out, but you have nowhere to go, and even if you did, you have no way to get there.This is the situation that the heroine, Patricia, experiences in “Patti Cake$,” a condition rendered with such bleak precision by writer-director Geremy Jasper that it presents a challenge, for the audience and for the filmmaker: Do you really want to go to this world? Do you really want to sit and look at nothing but awfulness and morons for almost two hours?After all, this is not like going to see, for example, “Dunkirk,” which is also a trying experience, but it’s edifying. “Patti Cake$” shows us something we already know about, and, if we’re from the Northeast, may have even witnessed. It is hard to make an interesting movie about people who are incapable of expressing a single interesting thought. Yes, the heroine is the exception here, but how much fun is it to watch a person getting spiritually suffocated, in scene after scene?Trailer for the Sundance Fest breakout comedy-drama Patti Cakes. Warning: This video contains profanity.Ultimately, “Patti Cake$” becomes worth it, because it finds its way to some kind of uplift without losing its truth, but it’s a close call. If you see it, there may be stretches where you’ll want to give up and say, “Enough already.” Yet something in Danielle Macdonald’s performance keeps us in our seats, a truth, a yearning of the soul, a desperation to find the exit, which makes common cause with our own desire to bolt out of that ugly world and never look back.Patricia is 23, obese and mocked for it — called “Dumbo” by people in her northern New Jersey town. She is doing menial jobs and living with her mother (Bridget Everett) and grandmother (Cathy Moriarty), who do very little but park themselves in front of the TV set and smoke. Patti wants something better, to be a rap star, but she is hemmed in by poverty, a culture of failure, and the world’s indifference to any talent that arrives in an unexpected package.In its broad outlines, “Patti Cake$” may sound like a female version of “8 Mile” (2002), starring Eminem, but there’s one crucial difference that keeps “Patti Cake$” from really taking flight: Danielle Macdonald isn’t a rapper. She’s an Australian actress who, for the role, had to learn how to rap. She does a good job, and yet, you can sometimes feel the strain. With Eminem, he just had to open his mouth, and you felt like you were blasted by a fire hose of verbal brilliance. With Macdonald, it feels like rooting for her and feeling relief when she stops, that she got away with it.This becomes an unintended problem for the movie, because unless we think Patti is brilliant, we are liable to think that her hip-hop ambitions are deluded. This doesn’t quite happen. Instead, we become willing to accept Patti’s talent as a conceit of the story, even if we don’t ever really feel it. That’s bad enough, but, in this context, it’s also good enough.Indeed, if you put aside rap, “Patti Cake$” is more valuable as a story about what it’s like to be a woman in what’s close to being a man’s game, a white person in a black game, and a fat person in a skinny game. It’s less about music and more about how hard it is — and how bad it feels — to be absolutely and completely on the outside. And though the movie is uncompromising on that score — and shows its heroine going through a series of humiliations that are almost as painful to watch as they would be to experience — it’s not self-pitying. It’s dead-eyed accurate, and that’s its ultimate redemption.So she’s not Eminem. There’s only one of those. Patti is something else, the patron saint of being on the outside looking in. And because every one of us knows that feeling, everyone can connect with her story. ",1
"In Bruges: Comedy-drama. Starring Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Martin McDonagh. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)With In Bruges, writer-director Martin McDonagh has made the movie that Guy Ritchie kept trying to make a few years ago. It's a story of criminals, with lots of working-class Irish banter, colorful characters, absurd situations and an intricate and irresistible plotline. Ritchie never succeeded. His dialogue was never clever enough; his characters never got off the page, and his plots were impenetrable. But McDonagh has done it with enviable ease, right out of the starting gate with his first feature. But then McDonagh is a very talented guy. In his other life, he's a playwright, with a string of Broadway and West End hits to his credit, including The Pillowman, which is one of the best plays of recent years. In Bruges is not an achievement on that scale, nowhere near it. At the same time, compared with most movies, this is something very fine - not just witty and lively, but with a soul to it, as well. That soul comes out in three complicated comic performances and in the conscience that informs and underlies the story.The film represents one of the few completely successful comic treatments of hit men in movies, usually a sour subject. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are the professional killers, who are sent by their boss to Bruges, Belgium, after a disastrously botched job. Bruges is a beautiful medieval city, with canals and museums and buildings from the 12th century, but as soon as Ray (Farrell) arrives, he thinks it's a dump, while Ken (Gleeson), his partner, loves it.Through his actors and through hints in the dialogue, McDonagh is able to suggest a lot about these men and their backgrounds. Gleeson brings a sad humanity to Ken, whose life went off course years ago, the result of some calamity. Meanwhile Ray is in turmoil, a young guy of basically decent instincts, who's not too smart and has made a terrible choice. It's a tribute to McDonagh's skill that the film can remain essentially comic, while doing justice to the characters' guilt and self-questioning.In the past few months, with Cassandra's Dream and now this, we've found out something about Farrell. He's not a matinee idol, and he's not a suave or heroic leading man. He's a terrific character actor, and he can go to low places that suave heroes can't risk, like anguish, self-hatred, embarrassment, utter confusion and buffoonery. That's his address as an actor, low status, inner conflict and the impulse to break free through reckless action. This role couldn't be more in his zone.Though the plot is always moving forward, McDonagh knows when to ease off the pedal and lavish time on a scene, or take a moment to satirize the travel experience. In the course of their sightseeing, the hit men run into Americans who either: 1) are enormously, spectacularly obese, 2) get apoplectic if people are smoking around them or 3) keep apologizing for being American. As anyone who has traveled abroad in recent years can testify, McDonagh's not making this stuff up.Half the fun of In Bruges is in how it unfolds, and so talk about the story is best left to a minimum. The guys are in a lovely medieval city around Christmastime, taking in the sites and experiencing civilization at its best, while internally absorbing the contrast between the environment and their function in it. They're waiting for a call from their boss, maybe to do another job.McDonagh is gifted enough that even minor characters are vivid in the moment. Every conversation is not just an opportunity to move the story along but to do something new that surprises or delights. When Ralph Fiennes shows up as the boss, he's not the usual Fiennes. He's a cockney, contained in manner, clipped in speech, but always spilling over into rage. It all comes through, the character's nonstop sense of aggrievement, the limits of thinking, and his specific and sincerely held notions of personal honor. These shadings, dimensions and notions are slipped in under the radar, just as a consequence of McDonagh's telling the truth, moment to moment. In Bruges is not a great movie, but there's no mistaking that it's the product of a great talent.-- Advisory: This film contains sex talk, sexual situations, drug use and graphic, disturbing violence. This is not for children.",1
"In his previous movies, Chris Rock has been brilliant only in flashes. But with “Top Five,” his third feature as a writer-director, he has made a film that’s as consistently smart and funny as his stand-up comedy.He takes an old idea, from Preston Sturges by way of Woody Allen, but he does it in his own way. He plays a successful comedian who is tired of being funny, who longs to be taken seriously. “Top Five” takes place over the course of a single day, as Andre Allen (Rock) promotes his latest movie, “Uprize!,” a somber epic he wrote, directed and starred in about a 19th century Haitian slave revolt.Rock structures “Top Five” in a way that gives him lots of freedom and plays to his strengths. For most of the movie, Andre goes about his business in New York City, while being interviewed by a reporter (Rosario Dawson). Though Rock isn’t nearly as intense in these conversations as he is onstage, the interview banter has some of the flavor of his stand-up. It also gives the movie a solid spine that allows for digressions and flashbacks.One flashback shows a scene from one of Andre’s blockbuster “Hammy the Bear” movies, in which he wore a bear suit as a crime-fighting grizzly. It’s only a slight exaggeration of the kind of awfulness that could actually find an audience. The brief snippets of the Haitian slave revolt movie “Uprize!” are even more hilarious.Rock satirizes trends in pop culture, such as reality TV, by giving Andre a fiancee who is a reality star. The action takes place entirely on the day of his bachelor party, the day before he is to be married on camera, in front of millions. Rock justifies how someone as cynical and savvy as Andre could get caught up in such ridiculousness by making the reality star appealing (Gabrielle Union) and by making Andre, for all his success, personally and artistically lost.Rock keeps Andre close enough to himself to show us what he knows but far enough away to allow for the invention that comes with distance. “Top Five” never stops being funny, but the jokes are informed by a sense of the rigors and pressures of being a comedian. At one point, Andre tells the reporter that the minute you become even slightly famous, people start lying to you about everything — and he gives examples of it. Another hazard of working under stress and in nightclubs is ending up a drunk. In “Top Five,” Andre is four years into his sobriety, but he’s still struggling with it and wondering what being sober will do to his comedy.Much of the movie is laugh-out-loud funny, though here and there a joke will cross into foul and fall flat. Kevin Hart, Adam Sandler, Jerry Seinfeld and other comedians show up in cameo roles and are used to good effect. They’re not just there to surprise you with their presence. They’re funny.As an actor, Rock isn’t bad, and that’s saying something, given the fact that he’s directing himself and that many of his scenes are fairly serious. But then he gave himself the advantage of casting himself opposite Dawson, an emotionally ready actress who helps get him where he needs to go. Throughout “Top Five,” there are scenes in which Rock and Dawson play off each other over the course of long takes, riding off the other’s responses. If there’s a surprise to “Top Five,” it’s the emotional undercurrent that Rock writes and Dawson brings out. What lingers hours later aren’t just the laughs but the people.",1
"In his recent movies, Al Pacino has been devoting himself to showing what it’s like to be an old guy. He was an old cop in “Righteous Kill,” an old gangster in “Standup Guys,” an old actor in “The Humbling,” and now he’s an old rock star in “Danny Collins.” In each of those roles, his age was not incidental but was very much a part of what those movies had to say. With “Danny Collins,” this movement in Pacino’s career gets interesting. Until now, the most indelible Pacino has always been the young man. Many actors experience a heyday in their 40s, but Pacino had his in his 30s, when he made a series of classics, including the first two “Godfather” movies, “Serpico,” “Dog Day Afternoon” and “...And Justice for All.” He’ll never top that, but these recent movies may end up creating a new indelible Pacino image, as well as an important third act in a great actor’s career. These new films explore questions that Hollywood usually avoids: What is it like to have been somebody in the world, but then lose your ability or interest? How do you escape the patterns of a lifetime? How do you conduct yourself when you feel the same as ever, but the clock is running down? And what, if anything, really matters in the end? “Danny Collins” is an entertaining and refreshing take on these questions, with Pacino as a megastar of more than 40 years standing, a pop elder statesman like Bob Dylan or Paul McCartney, whom even 20-year-olds would recognize.But unlike Dylan or McCartney, Danny hasn’t written a song in 30 years; and though he sells out big arenas, he can’t help but feel like he lost himself along the way. Wherever he goes, everybody wants to hear his last big hit, “Hey, Baby Doll,” a song that sounds like light, pleasing pop the first time you hear it, but by the second or third time is revealed as an anvil around his neck. Singing “Hey, Baby Doll” to 20,000 people isn’t like breaking rocks for a living, but anyone could see how that wouldn’t be fulfilling. Then one day his longtime agent (Christopher Plummer) gives him an unexpected present. Apparently, back in 1971, John Lennon wrote a letter to Danny warning him about the dangers of fame and inviting him to hang out with him. The letter was never delivered, and now, more then 40 years later, Danny seizes on this missive  as the summons to change his life. Maybe if he’d met Lennon, he wouldn’t have dried up as an artist or turned into a nostalgia act.“Danny Collins” is a fun glimpse into stardom on the ultimate level. Every person he meets feels privileged just to talk to him. He is greeted only by smiles; and, in return, he has to perform and act high spirited, even if he doesn’t feel that way. For sure, it enhances the movie that Danny is being played by Pacino, a star of equal magnitude, and at times we can’t help but wonder where the character ends and Pacino begins. As you might expect, the movie is about one man’s attempts at redemption, both as an artist and as a human being, but there’s a nice fluidity and freedom to writer-director Dan Fogelman’s storytelling, so things never become predictable. Bobby Cannavale has a supporting role as Danny’s son, who is bitter at never having known his father, though at least he should be happy that he got his height from mom’s side of the family. Cannavale has too often been cast in thuggish roles. Here he retains some thuggish power, but he’s basically a sensitive family man. As the woman who becomes Danny’s conscience — a hotel manager that he keeps flirting with — Annette Bening is warm but wary, projecting the self-protective aura of someone who knows she is out of her depth. It’s a subtle performance, suggesting lots of thought and suppressed emotion.By the way, “Danny Collins” is inspired by the true story of Steve Tilston, a British musician who received a 1971 letter from John Lennon some 30 years after it was written. The gist of the letter was about the same, but all the characters and circumstances are creations of the filmmaker. Curiously, that makes “Danny Collins” one of two movies currently in release — the other is “Living Is Easy With Eyes” closed — based on something John Lennon did in real life. In both cases, Lennon extended himself in a generous way that took him no more than 10 minutes, and he probably never thought of it again. But over 40 years later, it all comes back.",1
"In the first minutes of “The Gift,” a newly relocated couple is looking at a house with a real estate agent and thinking about buying. They like the view. They don’t realize they’re in a thriller, and so they violate the first rule of thrillers, which is “Don’t buy a house with glass walls. Sure, during the day you will have a view, but at night you will become the view, and you will not like who’s watching.”A scene or two later, they’re in a store, and the husband, Simon (Jason Bateman), is approached by a man he doesn’t at first recognize. He’s Gordon, played by Joel Edgerton, who also wrote and directed, and apparently he and Simon went to high school together. Simon’s wife, Robyn (Rebecca Hall), is immediately friendly to the old acquaintance, and they exchange some personal information, thus violating the second rule of thrillers: “It is utterly essential — indeed, a matter of life and death — that you assume everyone you meet is insane.”“The Gift” takes its title from the thoughtful little gifts that Gordon starts leaving at the couple’s door. Then he starts showing up, always polite and helpful, if perhaps a bit socially awkward, but there’s nothing about him that is particularly alarming, unless you’ve seen this kind of movie before. If you have, you will be sure to remember the third rule of thrillers, going back all the way to Norman Bates and beyond: “Emotional neediness is the first sign of a homicidal maniac.”This is what’s so good about “The Gift”: It keeps some of the rules of thrillers (there are more than three), but it violates others, and it will keep you guessing, until the last minutes, about which rules it plans to keep or discard. The movie replaces the familiar sense of inevitability with an overall aura of dread. Better yet, the movie’s surprises come from more than a filmmaker’s calculated impulse to surprise. Edgerton actually has something to say and uses the maniac-menaces-nice-people genre as his vehicle for saying it. Along the way, he ends up expanding a genre that could certainly use a little letting out. The performances are rich and get richer upon reflection. Hall is the movie’s open book, sensitive, intelligent and frightened. The men are harder to read. Edgerton makes it clear that there is something very wrong with Gordon, but the specifics of what’s wrong reveal themselves only gradually. Bateman as Simon is the movie’s most complex creation, an unusual combination of blitheness and irritability, breeziness and anger. He is at least as interesting as the man who’s menacing him.The only drawback, a substantial one, is that when it’s over, you may remember things that happened in the movie that don’t entirely make sense in retrospect. There’s nothing here that isn’t justifiable. Arguments could be made. But “The Gift” stretches things a little too much for it to be a first-rate thriller. Still, among second-rate thrillers, it’s one of the best.",1
"In the late '30s, England agreed to open its doors to German Jewish children seeking refuge from Nazi oppression. The children came by the hundreds and thousands and were housed in orphanages and placed with foster families. Into the Arms of Strangers uses archival footage and interviews with the children, now elderly, who were part of that exodus. This film shows how difficult it was for Jewish adults to leave Nazi Germany, not just practically and emotionally, but logistically. Countries were not accepting refugees, and only England was taking children. This led to heartrending scenes at railway stations, where children said goodbye to their parents, many of whom later perished in the death camps. The stories are powerful. In one case, a woman tells of her father yanking her off the train at the last minute. The result was that she ended up, a year later, going with her parents to Auschwitz. The documentary details the activities of the refugees in England, as well as their treatment. These particulars are not always scintillating, but even at its slowest, the film has value as a historical document. At its best, the film gives a human face to stories of unimaginable suffering and unexpected triumph. -- Mick LaSalle 'SOLAS' SOLAS: Drama. Starring Ana Fernandez and Maria Galiana. Directed by Benito Zambrano. (Not rated. 98 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza.) Spanish director Benito Zambrano is the anti-Almodovar. In Solas, he has made an extraordinary and heartfelt film that is in no way zany, brash or farcical. It's about small but decisive movements of the soul. In English, the title would be Alone. The picture takes place in a city, where loneliness is especially acute. Ana Fernandez plays Maria, a hard-drinking 35-year-old cleaning woman. Her bitterness is scalding. To make matters worse, she finds out that she is pregnant by her verbally abusive boyfriend, a truck driver. Solas takes place over the course of a few days in which Maria's father recovers from an operation and her mother comes to stay with her. Maria Galiana plays the mother, a character written -- and played -- with great restraint. The script gives her little to say, none of it profound. Yet despite the fact that there is nothing saintly in her manner, one comes to see the mother as the embodiment of love. Both women are amazing, but Fernandez is the revelation. Until now she'd never starred in a feature, but Solas is enough to turn her into an international star. As Maria, Fernandez gives a compelling portrait of an intelligent woman in hell. She is closed off for most of the film, neither vulnerable nor excessively brash so as to suggest vulnerability. She is just a dark cloud. And then she lets go. She doesn't quite break down; Solas is too honest and too lacking in unearned sentiment for that. Fernandez merely lets down her guard for a moment and shows us a hint of Maria's anger and despair. The hurt is so deep it sucks the audience right into her pain. -- Mick LaSalle  JUST ONE TIME: Comedy. Starring Lane Janger, Joelle Carter, Guillermo Diaz and Jennifer Esposito. Directed by Janger. (Not rated. 93 minutes. At the Lumiere). Just One Time is a bedroom farce with little sex or humor, a weak premise and spotty acting. But it's mildly enjoyable anyway, thanks to a sneaky charm. Lane Janger directed, co-wrote and stars as Anthony, a New York City firefighter supposedly devoted to his lawyer fiancee, Amy. He just can't help fantasizing about her sleeping with another woman. Since he's such a moral guy, he wants the deed to take place before their Catholic wedding in 10 days. She agrees to it, but only if the homophobic Anthony sleeps with a man. Hilarity is supposed to ensue. Janger obviously hasn't known many women in the throes of wedding planning. Any self-respecting bride-to-be would rather serve Spaghetti-O's at the reception than spend the precious few days before the nuptials scouting out chicks. Even avowed swingers realize that place settings and flower arrangements take precedence over sexual high jinks during this time. Most of the comedy bits in Just One Time are strained at best. One scene, in which Anthony and Amy euphemistically discuss male and female body parts, is agonizingly sophomoric. But darned if this film doesn't have some nice touches. Guillermo Diaz and Jennifer Esposito shine as Anthony and Amy's possible conquests. Diaz (Party Girl) is rarin' to go but endearingly naive as an inexperienced gay man with a huge crush on Anthony. Jennifer Esposito, a standout in Summer of Sam, is brash and funny as a lesbian furniture restorer who catches Amy's eye. Janger took a big chance in casting himself as the lead. A self-conscious actor, he looks like a younger, scrawnier Sylvester Stallone, without the charisma. But somehow he makes us care about this doofus, especially when it looks as if Anthony's fantasy may have dire consequences. Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. -- Carla Meyer 'NON-STOP' NON-STOP: Action. Starring Tomoro Taguchi, Diamond Yukai, Shinichi Tsutsumi. Directed by Sabu. (Not rated. 82 minutes. In Japanese with English subtitles. At the Galaxy.) The latest in the Shooting Gallery film series is a skillful Japanese entry that all the same never rises above the level of its gimmick. Non-Stop is about three guys chasing one another. They chase each other . . . nonstop. It begins when a man who intends to rob a bank shoplifts a mask from a convenience store. The store clerk chases him -- and runs into a mobster to whom he owes money. So the mobster chases the store clerk, who chases the thief. The chase goes on for hours and hours. Interestingly, no one ever hails a cab. Within the constraints of its gimmick, director Sabu shows an impressive fluidity of perspective. What he does seems effortless, but it's not: He shows us a man running. Then he flashes back to show the man's past. Then he shows what he was daydreaming about in the past. Sabu does this without ever losing or even confusing the viewer. In one scene, the three men pass a pretty woman on the street. They see her for a split second, and each man has a sexual fantasy about her -- a different one for each man. The scene has the advantage of psychological truth. It also represents one filmmaker's heroic effort to include a sex scene, somehow, some way. Advisory: This film contains violence and nudity. -- Mick LaSalle 'A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS'A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: Comedy-drama. Starring Andrew Shim, Ben Marshall, Paddy Considine, Vicky McClure. Directed by Shane Meadows. (R. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere.) A Room for Romeo Brass is a promising wry comedy for its first 20 minutes or so. Then the story of two teenage boys from dysfunctional families in the prosaic British Midlands goes downhill fast. That's because this eccentric comedy-drama, written and directed by Shane Meadows (TwentyFourSeven), heads straight for creepily perverse territory. Suddenly, it's not amusing. Romeo Brass (Andrew Shim) is a beefy, giggly Afro-Anglo boy who buddies around with the asthmatic Gavin Knocks Woolley (Ben Marshall), his next-door neighbor. Neither can count on a warm home life -- Romeo's dad is a bullying, mostly absent bum, and Knocks' is a catatonic slouch who barely speaks but is unpleasant when he does. These boys are pranksters with attitude, but who can blame them? When they're bullied by kids in a park, a quirky adult slacker named Morell (Paddy Considine) intervenes, saving their hides. Morell finds out Romeo has a pretty older sister, Ladine (Vicky McClure), and he schemes to seduce her. So far so good. But Morell turns out to be a real creep, perverse and sadistic, as he works his awkward charms on Romeo, Ladine and Knocks. An ugly spiral of hostility and twisted motives turns this film into a distasteful experience. Still, it's well acted, and if viewers have a need to see a memorable portrait of a creep, Considine, a musician making his screen debut, turns in a solid performance. The kids are believable, and director Meadows gives the film enough earthiness to make it all strangely plausible. Trouble is, it's a downer of a story. Advisory: This movie contains violence, raw language, sexual themes. -- Peter Stack ",1
"In this image released by Fox Searchlight Pictures, McKenna Grace, left, and Chris Evans appear in a scene from, Gifted. (Wilson Webb/Fox Searchlight Pictures via AP)In this image released by Fox Searchlight Pictures, McKenna Grace, left, and Chris Evans appear in a scene from, Gifted. (Wilson Webb/Fox Searchlight Pictures via AP)From a distance, “Gifted” might not seem like much. It’s a combination of two kinds of movies — or rather two kinds of movie cliches — a custody battle story, and a story about a math genius. In this case, the genius is a gifted natural, kind of like Matt Damon in “Good Will Hunting,” only a lot younger.But in its details, in its characters and their relationships, in the unfolding of its story, and even in the delicacy of its filming, “Gifted” rises above cynical expectation. Far from a canned piece of work, it feels sincere and inspired. It’s not going to shake up the world, but it’s a very nice and well-made movie.It also signals a moment of redemption for Chris Evans, who has spent the past few years blotting out the memory that he was ever an actor by playing Captain America in an endless series of superhero movies, some of them good, some of them bad, but all of them vaguely embarrassing. The case of Evans is practically a question for some philosophy class — would you take unimaginable fame and wealth in exchange for years of your life spent running around in tights and pretending it matters? But here he’s lovely, not ridiculous or arrogant, but sensitive and full of some very becoming humility. He plays a man trying to raise his 7-year-old niece. As the niece, Mary, Mckenna Grace is about the cutest thing on the planet; and, unusual for a child actor (particularly for one playing a math genius), she is not in the least obnoxious. She, along with director Marc Webb and writer Tom Flynn, makes Mary interesting even before we realize her special talent. At first, all we know is that she’s smart and that Uncle Frank (Evans) seems inordinately worried about the outside world figuring that out.The first outsider to grasp Mary’s gift is her first-grade teacher, played by Jenny Slate. If you saw Slate in “Obvious Child,” you might well be surprised to find that this is not someone doomed to portraying relentless personalities. She’s quiet, gentle and concerned here, and yet her comic ability pays off in several scenes. Slate is inspired casting here.Frank’s mission in life, his reason for being, is to make sure that Mary has a childhood, that she has friends and joins the Girl Scouts and someday goes to the prom. If this means not fully exploiting a God-given gift, he’s OK with that, but even then he’s not sure. Some gifts are so extraordinary they’re practically like emanations from the beyond. Is it right or wrong for a person in possession of such a gift not to commit to its special frequency?One person with a sure answer is Lindsay Duncan as Frank’s mother and Mary’s grandmother. Duncan, who scared Michael Keaton as the theater critic in “Birdman,” goes a long way toward scaring the entire audience in “Gifted.” Once she knows that Mary has the special family gift, she insists that the little girl should live with her and that Mary’s life should be spent doing nothing but studying math and expanding her abilities.Though there is no question in any viewer’s mind as to which parent figure is preferable, the script makes the interesting choice of giving each side its due. No one is entirely wrong or right. To consign a little child to a galley-slave existence of around-the-clock drudgery would be cruel. At the same time, running from a gift is at the very least impractical, and at worst is a denial of selfhood.“Gifted” sifts through these issues, while staying close to the emotions of the case, and, long before the end, it has built an intense involvement within the viewer. By the time the movie is through, you end up caring about the fate of everybody in the movie. And not just the people — little Mary’s cat, too.",1
"In this photo provided by The Weinstein Company, Sienna Miller is Edie Sedgwick in George Hickenlooper's Factory Girl. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company/Patti Perret)In this photo provided by The Weinstein Company, Sienna Miller is Edie Sedgwick in George Hickenlooper's Factory Girl. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company/Patti Perret)'Factory Girl' Drama. Directed by George Hickenlooper, With Sienna Miller, Guy Pearce and Hayden Christensen. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle reviews.]If you know anything about Edie Sedgwick, you know all those things going in and -- as was also the case with The Notorious Bettie Page -- there's little there to justify a biography. Yet working within those inevitable limits, director George Hickenlooper and his cast and crew come up with interesting things. For one, the film has the most decisive take on Warhol that has yet been committed to film, and the most persuasive. The mild-mannered Warhol is depicted as close to a satanic figure, a soul-destroying sadist who collects people for the sake of destroying them. His art celebrates superficiality -- his paintings are amusing, unremarkable surfaces that make a withering, banal statement, and he seems to look at people as though they were similar: amusing and unremarkable entities, only worthy of being cracked open to see what's inside. When he celebrates them, it's with the implicit idea that they, too, are superficial and disposable. Everyone gets 15 minutes of fame because that's all anybody deserves. As Warhol, Guy Pearce is funny -- every screen portrayal of Warhol is funny -- but it's also detailed, magnetic and disturbing, without question a portrait of evil. Whether or not he deserves it, he gets the back of the hand from the film, while Bob Dylan, who's alive and can still sue, is treated carefully. Dylan is never mentioned by name, even though Hayden Christensen is made to look just like him and imitates his vocal patterns. Still, if it's the movie's intention to present Dylan as unloving and full of himself, it succeeds. One comes away from Factory Girl certain that every man Sedgwick ever trusted was some kind of sadist. Such is the fate of a lot of women. Two things distinguish Sedgwick. Her flameout was spectacular, and her sadists were at least accomplished. I've saved the best for last: Sienna Miller. The role demands a lot of her -- youthful confidence and its slow disintegration; exuberant enthusiasm and its change into addiction and enslavement; different kinds of wholehearted love and as many resulting varieties of soul-racking disillusionment; and a physical transformation from absolute freshness to complete, wasted ruination. Miller gets old and used up before our eyes, and we not only see it, we see what it means to experience it. This is a movie about power, and its spectacle is that of a woman losing all of it. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity, simulated sex, harsh language and drug use. -- Mick LaSalle 'The Dead Girl' Drama. Starring Marcia Gay Harden, Brittany Murphy, Kerry Washington and Toni Collette. Directed by Karen Moncrieff. (R. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Toni Collette looks sullen. It's Toni Collette in her can't-make-eye-contact mode. Nothing good can ever happen to her. She knows it, we know it. Anyway, one day, walking in the woods near her house, she finds the brutally beaten, decomposing body of a young woman. But she doesn't freak out. No, she just goes home and gives her ancient mother a bath as the soundtrack emits mournful, ominous chords. It must be said that The Dead Girl is a film of considerable integrity. But before that, something else must be said: That's about as unappetizing an opening to a film as can be imagined. Any one of these elements is a possible deal breaker: a sulking Collette. A rotting dead body. A depressive soundtrack. And giving ol' Mom a bath. But writer-director Karen Moncrieff combines all of them, as if to say, Sit through this thing. I dare you. Those who accept the challenge will find that the movie gets better. It's well acted, has an accomplished cast, and contains some fine writing. It also has the virtue of gaining in interest and complexity as it goes along. On the downside, the film is mired in gloom, not just sadness, but heaviness. It presents an unattractive world in unattractive terms, which is honest, but so is a one-week vacation to Calcutta. The narrative is start-and-stop, showing how various people are affected by the murder of a young prostitute. The film is broken into segments, small stories making up the larger story, and some of these are more compelling than others. The Collette story, of a woman living with her demanding, sadistic mother -- Piper Laurie, who can do demanding and sadistic with the best of them -- has little to recommend it but the sound of Laurie's powerful, frightening voice. Also of little impact, surprisingly, is the segment in which Mary Beth Hurt, as an unhappy wife, realizes that her husband is a serial killer. The movie maintains a tenuous hold on life and then blossoms into something special in the segment in which the dead girl's mother (Marcia Gay Harden) shows up at her daughter's apartment, meets the fellow-prostitute roommate (Kerry Washington) and becomes acquainted with her long-lost daughter's life. Harden and Washington are just superb, and their story is full of well-timed revelations, including revelations of character. In the last segment, Brittany Murphy shows up in flashback as -- guess who? -- the dead girl, and she's terrific. Murphy clearly worked on trying to sound like someone living the low life. The timbre of her voice, the nature of her speech and even her facial expressions suggest a profitable study of drug addicts and others on the fringes. She inhabits the soon-to-be-dead girl with no vanity. Her performance combines, poignantly, a lust for life with a kind of drug-enforced idiocy bordering on the hopeless. There really is a person there, Moncrieff and Murphy tell us, even if half the time all you can see is damage. -- Advisory: Simulated sex, a gruesome dead body, nudity and strong language. 'Tears of the Black Tiger' Action film. Starring Chartchai Ngamsan, Stella Malucchi, Supakorn Kitsuwon and Arawat Ruangvuth. Directed by Wisit Sasanatieng. (In Thai with English subtitles. Not rated. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The best way to approach Tears of the Black Tiger is with a sense of humor and a pair of shades. It features the fullest rainbow of psychedelic colors -- shocking pink, eye-popping turquoise, blinding chartreuse -- since those laughable 1960s flicks that tried to approximate an LSD trip. Tears takes you on a different kind of trip, back to the heyday of the Hollywood melodrama and Western. That this Thai action film is intended to be nothing more than highly stylized nonsense is signaled in an early scene: Dum (Chartchai Ngamsan), a poor but honorable young man forced to become an outlaw to avenge his father's murder, fires a bullet that ricochets off a wall before hitting a rival. A sign pops up saying, Did you catch that? If not we'll play it again, and the bullet follows the same trajectory in slow motion. The rest of the movie also is one big in-joke. It's watchable, but eventually wears you down with its over-the-top cleverness. Pastiche, or homage, as first-time director Wisit Sasanatieng probably prefers to think of his outlandish creation, is hard to pull off. Most filmmakers put their energy into trying to make you forget that what you're watching is only a movie. Sasanatieng, however, goes the same route as Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill, creating a self-conscious parody of genre movies. (Sasanatieng got there first; Tears was made in 2001 but is only now getting an American release.) It's meant to evoke early two-reeler silent Westerns as well as Technicolor tearjerkers like those directed by Douglas Sirk in which a great romance is doomed to failure for reasons beyond the lovers' control. Doing double duty as screenwriter, Sasanatieng employs the most conventional obstacle: class difference. Dum falls in love with an extremely wealthy girl Rumpoey (Stella Malucchi) during World War II. Fate and her father conspire to keep them apart. A decade later, Dum has advanced to top bandit in the toughest gang in the Thai countryside. Rumpoey is being pushed into an arranged marriage to a conniving police captain (Arawat Ruangvuth, whose good looks are a distraction -- you keep wondering why Rumpoey objects to the match). But her ardor for Dum hasn't cooled. The young actors' inexperience shows, although even seasoned pros couldn't have made these characters believable. They're written to be caricatures. As a consolation for her melodramatic lines, Malucchi gets to wear fabulous clothes. She appears in a tight-fitting scarlet dress as Rumpoey awaits her childhood love. The bad guys all wear black, accessorized by colorful scarves tied around their necks. The production notes make much of Sasanatieng's use of iris shots, wipes and back projection to achieve the look of Hollywood films from the mid-20th century. Tears of the Black Tiger is a visual treat. But imitating other movies is a far lesser talent than coming up with something original. -- Advisory: Stylized violence and mild sexuality. -- Ruthe Stein ",1
"In “Blade Runner 2049,” there’s a sequence inside an old casino, where holographs of long-dead performers can be seen with the press of a button. There’s Elvis singing in his white jumpsuit. There’s a brief flash of Marilyn and another of Liberace. There’s a song by Sinatra. And seeing these people, a forlorn feeling sets in. These are emblems of a simpler time, when everyone understood what it meant to be human.There’s no such understanding in the world of 2049. In this sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1982 film, it’s impossible to tell one kind of mechanical human being — that is, “replicant” — from another kind, and equally impossible to tell a replicant from a human being. And this brings up all kinds of existential questions that make “Frankenstein” seem like a cheery fairy tale: Is there really much of a difference, after all? Maybe replicants are like humans and have a soul. Or maybe humans are like replicants, and everything’s mechanistic, and the whole notion of the soul is just fantasy.The task of science fiction is often to threaten us with the prospect of essential human values not prevailing into the future — and then, sometimes, to assure us that they will. “Blade Runner 2049” offers no such assurance. It takes modern-day anxieties and blows them out, presenting a world in which life is less than cheap. It’s not even life.Ryan Gosling, with that look he has, is ideally cast here as K, a replicant LAPD officer whose job is to track down and kill older-model replicants. What’s the look? Complete self-confidence and absolute confusion, the eyes of someone who knows exactly what to do and yet has no idea what any of it means. K’s confusion runs even deeper when he comes across evidence suggesting that a miracle took place some years back: A human woman and a replicant man apparently had children together, something that was supposed to be impossible.This discovery is the propelling incident of the movie. For K’s boss, Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), it represents a threat to the principalities of creation and to the structures of civil society. But for Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), the diabolical creator of replicants, and to his evil assistant, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), it represents an opportunity. If replicants can reproduce on their own, they can populate distant planets and completely supplant humanity.In this way, K finds himself at the center of the conflict. He is assigned to find and kill the hybrid replicant/human offspring, but everybody is tracking him, trying to help or interfere, and meanwhile he is coping with his own doubts. That’s a modest amount of story, but it turns out to be enough to embroider a series of scenes that play like somber ruminations on the nature of existence and the future of life on Earth. Yes, this is a movie that takes itself very seriously, but it saves itself by taking its subject even more seriously.Eventually, Harrison Ford shows up as Deckard, the hero of the 1982 movie, and it’s always good to see him, even if he never looks happy to see anybody. Given the state of the world (not just 2049’s, but ours), Ford’s incurable grumpiness seems like a refreshing and healthy alternative to despair. The entrance of Ford signals the coming of some genuine action sequences, but for the most part, “Blade Runner 2049” is quiet, thoughtful science fiction, nothing like a summer blockbuster, but more like “Arrival,” from the same director, Denis Villeneuve.Villeneuve keeps the emphasis on the performances. He casts fairly unknown actors and gives them a chance to make strong impressions, sometimes in a single scene. The Swiss actress Carla Juri has only one long scene (and a bit of another), as a sheltered scientist who specializes in the creation and implantation of false, happy memories, but she remains vivid throughout, as lasting as one of the scientist’s fake-happy creations.“Blade Runner 2049” is long and slow. It’s never boring, but it’s a little too mired in one sustained note of sadness to break out as a great experience or to stand out as a great movie. Still, there are some remarkable scenes: A large plastic bag breaks, and a brand new replicant, a fully grown woman, drops onto a platform, dripping with slime, in what looks like a gross parody of human birth. And we think, like Peggy Lee, is that all there is? Is that all there is to being born and being alive?“Blade Runner 2049” leaves us with such thoughts, the kind that Mary Shelley was writing about two centuries ago. The difference here is that with artificial intelligence breathing down our collective neck, it’s beginning to feel personal. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic.

"In “Cake,” Jennifer Aniston takes on 15 extra pounds and takes off the makeup, and what the audience ends up seeing is a normal-looking person, not a movie star. It’s not a radical transition like the one Charlize Theron made in “Monster” (from beautiful to ugly), but something a little more complicated and less from out of nowhere. Usually the Platonic ideal of average, Aniston in “Cake” is simply an average woman.This feels so right and so appropriate as the next step for Aniston that the decision to make “Cake” barely registers as brave, but it was. Beautiful movie stars do not let you see the lines on their face, and when they let you into their bedrooms, it’s not to show you what they really look like in the morning. To strip yourself down to normal while the world still worships your illusion is like Samson sitting down in a barber’s chair.So making “Cake” required confidence on Aniston’s part — in the nature of her appeal, in the intelligence of her audience, but mainly in her own talent. There’s no safety net in this movie, no falling back on charm. There’s also no co-star to lean on and no escaping the scrutiny of the camera. Aniston is onscreen at virtually every moment, and half the time we’re looking at nothing but her face. If she had blown it, this would have been an epic embarrassment. She didn’t blow it.Instead, her performance is a triumph that might go some distance toward redefining her in the eyes of the public. She plays Claire, a 40ish woman suffering from chronic pain. Gradually, her story comes out, but all we know at first — and all you need to know now — is that she experienced some trauma in the recent past. Every move hurts. She can’t turn without wincing, and she has scars on her face.She also seems to have a knack for alienating people. Then again, when you’re in pain, who has time for diplomacy? Within her first five minutes of screen time, she unnerves her touchy-feely support group and gets a nervous phone call from her ex-husband. She is drinking and taking pills around the clock and seems to be half hoping she will accidentally kill herself. Her only contact is with her maid — Claire is well off — played by Adriana Barraza with subtlety and complex emotion.“Cake” follows Claire as she goes about her life, trying to find the reasons behind the suicide of a young friend (Anna Kendrick), but her search is halfhearted. In truth, “Cake” has a loose, structureless quality, which is partly a strength and partly a flaw. It’s a design that absolutely required a powerhouse performance at its center or it would make no sense. Or, to say that more positively, director Daniel Barnz and screenwriter Patrick Tobin provided the space for an actress to become the whole movie, and she did.What makes Aniston, of all actresses, especially right for “Cake” is that her comedy has always had a certain ruefulness underlying it, an understanding of life’s limits, a kind of glum acceptance. So the transition into sadness and desolation is a natural step for her. There’s a sex scene in this film that is so loveless, so bleak, so without tenderness or even lust that it’s haunting, an emblem of how, with just a little bad luck, a life can go off the rails. But with Aniston, there’s no sense of shock at life’s reversals, but rather the impression that she knew all along how things might go for her, and time has just confirmed her worst suspicions.Of course, she should have been nominated for a best actress Oscar, especially this year, with such a weak field. Unfortunately, the studio arranged for few screenings and sent links when they should have sent DVDs. Even then, with one hand and four fingers tied behind her back, she was nominated for a Golden Globe.But the awards matter less than what “Cake” shows. This is a real actress. (Perhaps now, finally, critics can retire their obligatory references to “Rachel” every time they review one of Aniston’s movies.) Beyond that, if it wasn’t already apparent before, this is someone for the long haul.Aniston’s appeal has always been that of an exalted averageness. Olivia de Havilland had the quality decades ago, and Nathalie Baye in France has it. These are beautiful actresses who don’t seem out of reach, but rather seem emblematic of the average woman of their time. The good news of “Cake” is that it proves that Aniston can be appealing without being exalted or gorgeous, by simply being average. That might not matter so much now, but it’s going to become very important in about 10 years.Alas, American movies of today aren’t what they were when de Havilland came into her maturity, nor are they anything like the French cinema that has maintained Baye’s stardom from her 20s through her mid-60s. Still, on the basis of “Cake,” it’s safe to guess that Aniston won’t be one of those actresses who disappear at 50 or 55. People will continue wanting to see her, because they’ll want to see themselves. ",1
"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull:Adventure. Starring Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, Shia LaBeouf and Karen Allen. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times, and buy tickets for select theaters, at SFGate.com/movies.) Nothing about the new Indiana Jones movie feels creaky. Everything old is rejuvenated, including Harrison Ford, who looks younger and less cranky than he has in years. The movie moves. It has action sequences that are so enormous that they won't just wow audiences, but rock them back in their seats and make them laugh at the audacity of it all. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal is probably the worst of the Indiana Jones movies, but it's still pretty much a delight, from the beginning almost until the end. Almost. Something holds the fourth installment back, and that's director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepp's determination to make it an action movie in the modern style. If everything old about Indiana Jones is new again, the one thing new about it is what seems old: The filmmakers' insistence on making a film in which the action is nonstop, in which the viewer and the characters never quite have the chance to breathe. That Spielberg especially should want to try his hand at this is understandable. He is one of the pioneers of the modern action movie, and what could be more fun than to demonstrate, at an age when he could be resting on his Oscar, his Thalberg and his AFI awards, that he not only can master some new tricks but can do them better than anybody? And he can. The action in the new Indiana Jones is more inventive, more lovingly detailed and a lot more pleasurable than anything you could hope to see in action movies.  But in proving that he can do it, Spielberg also shows why it shouldn't be done. He shows why it's a dead-end. Even Spielberg reaches a point of diminishing returns, in which the movie begins to feel like a video game and the audience longs for - not quiet, not peace - but an opportunity to savor the reunions, the one between us and the characters, and also the one between Ford and Karen Allen, his co-star in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the original Indiana Jones film. This is not to say we don't get little moments in there, but considering how much pleasure the audience is willing to take in the characters, and not just in their exploits, it's not quite enough. Yet anyone who sees the movie won't even know what I'm talking about until after the first hour. Audiences who have been anticipating Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull should love the first half, and skeptics will be persuaded. With a sense of fun that characterizes much of the film, Spielberg pulls from the old Hollywood playbook in introducing Ford. We see his hat. We see his silhouette. And then he turns and in a close-up mutters, Russians! That's right, Russians. The year is 1957, and the Soviets - particularly a scientist named Irina (Cate Blanchett) - are searching for paranormal artifacts. In particular, she's in search of a crystal skull and a lost South American city that she believes will be the key to world domination. She wants the Soviet Union to control everyone's mind. Fine. Every movie has to have a plot, and that's this one's. From the first scene, in which Indiana is kidnapped and brought to a facility in Nevada to help Irina, the consummate skill of the filmmakers is unmistakable. Director of photography Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List) composes the characters within the frame like Gregg Toland in an old William Wyler movie, with everything crisply outlined in deep focus. It's an homage to the 1940s style that doesn't copy the '40s so much as show how, say, a Toland might do things were he working today.  For a while, a long while, skill is enough. There's skill, for example, in the long chase scene through the jungle, in which Indiana and his cohorts have the crystal skull, and Irina and the Soviets want it. Screenwriter Koepp comes up with various ways for the characters to end up in each other's vehicles. Sometimes one side has the skull, sometimes another. There are cliffs to negotiate, and when all else fails, there's always an attack of giant ants. But skill without inspiration is something you can get from a Vegas act. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a professional job done by professionals. For better or worse, that's all it is. Be content with that or go watch the one with Sean Connery - again.  On the plus side, small flaws and too much action can't take away from the pleasure of seeing Ford back in this signature role and in his signature hat. Shia LaBeouf, his sidekick this time, plays well off the old man (What are you, like 80?). And it's no surprise to anybody when his mother turns out to be Marion (Allen), reunited with Ford after 27 years. Her role, as written, consists of little but high spirits and high-spirited carping, but Allen looks as happy as Marion at being the one Indiana ended up with, after all.  Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is no Raiders of the Lost Ark, but if you look at the long, tired history other sequels made years after the initial magic had faded - Rocky Balboa, The Phantom Menace, The Barkleys of Broadway - this has to rank among the respectable entries. -- Advisory:Lots of action and scenes of peril.",1
"Infamous: Drama. Starring Toby Jones, Sandra Bullock and Sigourney Weaver. Directed by Douglas McGrath. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet, despite those similarities, the films are very different -- different in terms of scenes, dialogue, cast and mood. Watch Capote and Infamous back to back for a rare illustration of the different ways roles can be played and stories told. Or watch Infamous on its own. It's a worthy film in its own right, with its own virtues. Before going into those virtues, however, the main question must be answered: Is it as good as Capote? The answer is no. Infamous offers a more surface rendering of the story, while Capote was more internal and mysterious. Infamous spells things out, including Capote's relationship with Perry, one of the killers, while Capote suggested things too complicated to be explained. Perhaps the difference can be summed up this way: Watching Philip Seymour Hoffman in the title role, it was easy to see Capote as someone truly extraordinary, perhaps a genius. Toby Jones in Infamous doesn't have that quality, though he does offer something almost as good: Watching him it's easy to believe he's really Truman Capote. That's the nagging thing about Infamous. Hoffman's Capote was a more interesting man, but one can't help but wonder: Is Toby Jones' portrayal the more true to life? He certainly looks and sounds just like Capote, and he acts as foolish as the fellow who routinely made a spectacle of himself on talk shows. Then again, perhaps Jones and director Douglas McGrath transposed the drunken mess of 1980 and moved him to 1960. It's certainly difficult to believe that the flouncing, fluttery, gossipy, ridiculous Capote, as played by Jones, could have felt, much less written, In Cold Blood. Yet is this a flaw in Jones' performance (and McGrath's screenplay) or an accurate presentation of the random mystery of talent? Infamous chooses to show Capote at work and at play, and so when he's not writing or researching, we see him hobnobbing with New York high society matrons, including best friends Babe Paley (Sigourney Weaver) and Slim Keith (Hope Davis). However, McGrath's presentation of high society is superficial, as a den of dimwitted narcissists; thus, its appeal to Capote can only be interpreted as mystifying or evidence of a character flaw. McGrath uses mock interviews with Paley and Keith, as well as with Diana Vreeland and Bennett Cerf (poorly caricatured by Juliet Stevenson and Peter Bogdanovich, respectively). These mock interviews, spoken to an unseen interlocutor, are an unnecessary crutch, but I think I know why McGrath kept them in: Sandra Bullock's mock interview as Nelle Harper Lee provides some of the best acting moments in the picture. Either through studying Lee or channeling someone else, Bullock adopts mannerisms and facial expressions that are not her own for this role and then works them into a well-crafted portrait of a highly internal, observant and deep-revolving spirit. It's the performance to take from the movie. Lee accompanies Capote, her childhood friend, on his first trip to Kansas, in the interval between the writing and the publication of her classic novel. Within minutes, Bullock has you convinced she wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. But Bullock is not at the center of Infamous, which, more than anything, deals with Capote's deepening identification and bond with Perry, one of the two murderers. Alas, this is the movie's weak spot. First, the casting of Daniel Craig -- a big, muscular guy -- as Perry is bizarre. It distorts the dynamic, as the real Perry was a little guy, with whom Capote shared a little-guy connection. But the main problem is that the interaction between Capote and Perry is unremarkable, not boring or badly written, but simply pedestrian. Capote here is too much of a pushover, seeming more like a man falling in love than an artist in ruthless pursuit of the truth. Their scenes are blustery and dramatic, but in a movie-like, predictable way, without much in the way of complexity or subtlety. Still, by the standards of most pictures, this is intelligent, thoughtful filmmaking. Really, it's only against the exalted benchmark standard set by Capote that Infamous falls short. -- Advisory: This movie contains strong language and graphic violence. ",1
"Inside Deep Throat: Documentary. Directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. (NC-17. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The documentary does a fine job of capturing the film's historical moment, a moment very different from our own. In 1972, Americans were reeling from a decade of unprecedented social change that had taken the country from Doris Day to Linda Lovelace in the blink of an eye. Even among people who were fairly progressive, there was a sense of a culture spinning out of control in a disturbing way. Mainstream movies had become more explicit, and many believed that Hollywood and the porn industry would eventually join forces -- that pornography was, in a sense, the advance guard. Hence the legal maneuvering over Deep Throat had bigger implications, with one side trying to make a last stand against smut and the other side wanting to crash the gates. In telling the story, the filmmakers interview several dozen people, who collectively give testimony to a cultural divide that, if anything, is as wide today as ever. What's fascinating is how freakish they all seem. On the right, there are prosecutors and anti-pornography activists saying loony things like,  'Deep Throat' attacks the very core of our being. Prosecutor Larry Parrish says that images from Deep Throat are still in his head 30 years later, and he can't erase them. What a privileged glimpse into the censorious mind. At the same time, the people on the left seem like slobs, who either really believe there's nothing morally wrong with having sex on camera for money or who pretend they don't have moral qualms, in the hope of making these standards mainstream. Both sides deserve each other. Both sides should live together on an island, where they can argue about sex all day, because they have that obsession in common. But heaven help us if one side ever wins the argument, because 90 percent of us would not like the world that either side would have us live in. Inside Deep Throat is inevitably the story of Linda Lovelace (nee Linda Bozeman), who was discovered by porn director Gerard Damiano. With the enthusiasm of a Salzburg concertmaster upon encountering the young Mozart, Damiano recognized in Lovelace's gag-free oral technique the makings of an American classic. The rest is history. Alas, the funding for Deep Throat reportedly came from underworld sources. Thus, no one connected with the film ever made any money. The tragedy of Lovelace's subsequent life is the most arresting part of the Deep Throat saga. It's also the one aspect most open to differing interpretations. After spouting the doctrines of free love and happy porn, she became an ally of feminists and an anti-pornography crusader. Then, not long before her death from injuries sustained in a car accident, she posed nude for a magazine. She was broke. She was ideologically confused. She lost jobs when her employes found out her identity. She was the victim, in a sense, of shame. But was this shame intrinsic; that is, the inevitable consequence of her behavior? Or was hers simply the story of a fragile woman who could not maintain her self-esteem in the face of the world's scorn? How you decide that question has a lot to do with how you see the world. I get the feeling Lovelace herself never quite decided. She knew she was a victim. That's about all she had figured out. If this were 200 years ago, Donizetti could do an opera about her. In contrast to Lovelace, her Deep Throat co-star Harry Reems found a way to turn the page by embracing Christianity and becoming a real estate dealer in Utah. He looks sane and healthy and seems to suffer from no ideological confusion. Inside Deep Throat is balanced enough to serve as a cautionary tale that cuts in several directions at once. Few people, upon seeing footage of Times Square in the 1970s, would want to return to the squalid, crime-infested days of pre-Giuliani New York. At the same time, it's difficult to look at the repressed faces of these prosecutors and federal agents and feel anything but misery that they and their ilk are in ascendance in today's America. It would be inaccurate to describe Inside Deep Throat as a plea for moderation, but it sure inspires a desire for moderation in its audience. -- Advisory: This film contains vivid excerpts from pornographic films.

"Intimate Strangers: Romantic drama. Starring Fabrice Luchini and Sandrine Bonnaire. Directed by Patrice Leconte. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the hands of director Patrice Leconte, this story becomes the basis for a strange almost-thriller, a psychological drama with undertones of romance and danger. Mostly, the film is a series of two-person conversations in which the woman talks about her abusive husband and his sexual problems, and the tax accountant listens. But listens is too weak a word. He discreetly devours her every word and watches her as though the Eternal Feminine, by some divine grace, has decided to smoke, pace and tell stories in his office. He's so happy that he's afraid to smile. He doesn't want to breathe on this situation. Fabrice Luchini, who plays the lawyer, is not an actor one associates with listening. He's one of the great talkers of the cinema, a hyper-charged actor known for verbal pyrotechnics. A subdued Luchini takes some getting used to, but it's what the movie demands, and he proves he can do long silences and think in the quiet. There are, in fact, an unusual number of silences and unanswered questions in Intimate Strangers and the fact that all this silence doesn't seem like a mannerism is a tribute to the unsettled mood Leconte creates and to the performances of Luchini and co-star Sandrine Bonnaire. Throughout the film, we always know what the lawyer is up to. But the woman remains a mystery. Is she truthful? Is she entrancing and neurotic or mad and destructive? Bonnaire, who also can play the most straightforward and wholesome of women, emerges over the course of the film as that classic figure of sophisticated cinematic fantasy: the woman of erotic destiny. She becomes more puzzling and more alluring as the film wears on. Is Intimate Strangers a romance? A thriller? A drama? It is, as they say, what it is. It's a movie by people who know there are few things more thrilling, or that seem more perilous, than meeting the romantic other and having those first, careful conversations. -- Advisory: This film contains lewd sex talk.

"Into the Wild: Drama. Starring Emile Hirsch, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook. Directed by Sean Penn. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and show times, and to buy tickets to select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.)It's hard to know what to make of Christopher McCandless - and that's what makes it hard to stop thinking about Into the Wild, Sean Penn's new film about McCandless' life. Newly out of college with the world before him, McCandless chucked it all for the life of a drifter. From an upper-middle-class family in the Northeast, he burned his money (literally) and went west, meeting people, communing with nature and doing odd jobs, on his way to his ultimate destination, Alaska. He wanted to go into the wild - into the wildest of the wild - in search of enlightenment and true experience.If McCandless' quest were merely magnificent, it would be easy to digest and forget. If it were merely idiotic, it would be easy to dismiss. Instead, his adventure seems to have been a little of both - grand and profound, pointless and wasteful. You could look at him as a spoiled rich kid motivated by a desire to punish his parents. Yet, his tenacity and gallantry in the face of disaster indicate genuine character, and his commitment to his dream was so outsize as to seem metaphorical.Artistically, the challenge for Sean Penn was to take this true story, based on Jon Krakauer's book, and give it the requisite sprawl without making it overlong or tiresome; to take a saga that could have been a dead slog through the woods and give it dramatic shape; and to film the story with an eye for its elusive shades of meaning. Penn does it all. His screenplay is a meticulous construction, which presents us with McCandless' Alaskan adventure up front, and then keeps cutting from it to show the adventures and stages that led him there, the people he met, the lives he touched. Even more impressive is the intuitive rightness with which Penn tells the story visually, because that's not really something that can be worked out fully in advance, on paper. It's hard to describe what Penn does exactly. Throughout he gives close-ups of odd details or unexpectedly pulls back to watch the action at a remote distance. However he does it, his approach feels right and creates a singular psychological effect - a sense that this story, playing out before us, has already happened. Penn emphasizes this strange and arresting sense of inevitability by twice having Emile Hirsch, who plays McCandless, break the fourth wall: He has Hirsch look directly into the camera, at the audience. These close-ups are complicated moments, in that we're meant to understand that it's both Hirsch and McCandless looking at us, simultaneously. And the meaning of these moments only deepens when we realize later that the shots were intended to evoke the movie's final shot, in which we see the real McCandless in a photo, looking at us with precisely that same mix of good humor and existential challenge.Penn takes an audience full of people - who'd complain if a theater's air conditioning were on too high - and persuades them that a young man who went into Alaska with just a backpack and a gun was something other than crazy. He does it by tapping into some inner sense or impulse within individuals that craves the ultimate test and that believes that making terms with the wilderness is somehow more soul-revealing than, say, figuring out how to survive in a big city. This is where the audience meets McCandless, on that gut level.Newly out of college, the young man wants to pursue something real, but he sees only falsehood and anger in his parents (played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and their way of life, so he takes off on the road. What follows are episodes that play out with just enough languor that they feel lived in, with Catherine Keener and a terrific newcomer, Brian Dierker, showing up as a hippie couple, and with Vince Vaughn vivid as some kind of farm foreman. Best of all, the movie provides an extraordinary showcase for 82-year-old Hal Holbrook, as a widower whose life opens up when he meets McCandless, and then closes down again.For all the movie's virtues, something holds me back from conferring the final laurel on Into the Wild. Eddie Vedder's original songs, which are heard a lot on the soundtrack, are too defining, taking the poetry of Penn's visuals and turning them into prose. And there's something about the joy bordering on awe with which everyone reacts to Chris on his travels that seems not quite true. Hirsch is magnetic and sensitive, but McCandless couldn't really have been the happy prophet that Hirsch plays here. He had to be more of a young pain in the neck. Still, this is one of those movies I can imagine deciding is a masterpiece in a month's time. And by any measure, Into the Wild is a big leap forward for Penn as a director and deserves to be one of the most talked about films of the season.-- Advisory: This film contains some nudity.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Iron Man: Sci-fi action. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by Jon Favreau. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Iron Man is an action sci-fi blockbuster extravaganza that provides cartoon thrills for thinking people. It's the best movie of its kind since the second Spider-Man movie four years ago. Getting the suit right is easy. Getting the man underneath the suit right - that was the challenge, and the filmmakers rose to it. Robert Downey Jr. - cynical, witty, blithe, covering up some underlying vulnerability with a smoke screen of banter - is an ideal Iron Man and an ideal actor to place at the center of this story. With Downey there, the whole movie is a blast. When the action is fast and furious, there's the fun of spectacle, and in the calmer moments, there's Downey, whose dialogue is essentially a series of deadpan one-liners. That the whole movie feels ad-libbed is in fact a tribute to Downey either way. To the extent it's ad-libbed, it's evidence of his wit. To the extent it isn't, is evidence of the place he has come to occupy in our movies, that his casting should automatically inspire the screenwriters (Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway) to come up with Robert Downey-type lines: Give me a Scotch, I'm starving. Director Jon Favreau is smart enough to let Downey puncture the pomposity of the sci-fi genre, but he's also smart enough to meet the genre's demands. The action is big, high-stakes and not played for laughs. The fact that the spectacle has its basis in character, and that Downey is such a likable presence, makes the action scenes all the more effective. This time, it's personal - for the audience, too. The movie tells a story grounded in real world 2008. The scene is Afghanistan, and Tony Stark (Downey), a billionaire arms dealer, is coming back from a successful demonstration of his latest weapon (missiles that flatten mountains, thus making it difficult for terrorists to hide in caves). He's chatting with soldiers in an armored truck, when the bad guys attack, and he's taken hostage. The Iron Man suit is the product of necessity. The terrorists give Stark the equipment to reproduce the superweapon - they want it for themselves. But he tricks them, and instead of building missiles, he builds an armored suit that shoots fire, bullets and missiles and that flies through jet propulsion. He comes back from the experience a changed man, a pacifist, but not a boring pacifist. He's willing to kill everybody it takes to defend his pacifism. At their worst, comic book heroes translate into flat cartoon characters in movies. But at their best, comic book characters have what Spider-Man has, and what Stark has, as well - a neurotic, forlorn eccentricity that's very distinct to the whole comic book thing. Stark has great frustrations. He's brilliant. He's essentially a loner. He's full of inner stress, and this makes him into a pressure cooker whose eruption will take the form of flamboyant action.There's an element of social commentary at work in this. You want to know how irrational the world is? It's so irrational that the most rational response a concerned genius can come up with is to perfect an iron suit and get into fantastic sky battles - and fantastic they are. For all of the movie's wit, Iron Man delivers on the spectacle, with Iron Man dodging jet fighters in one scene and going head-to-head against an even stronger Iron Man in another. Along the way, there's the kick of watching Stark develop the Iron Man suit in his basement laboratory - a funny, slapstick process of getting the bugs out. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Stark's personal assistant, and she turns out to be exactly the co-star Downey needs - sincere where he's arch, but someone with the sensitive awareness to grasp what he's really saying, as well as the humor to appreciate how he says it. Jeff Bridges, as Stark's business partner, sports some atypical facial topiary for this adventure. His head is shaved bald and he has a gray beard, and though he does a lot of smiling in the early scenes, something about him (besides the hair) just isn't reassuring. Bridges has mastered an art perfected by Kris Kristofferson: He knows how to grin merrily while keeping his eyes cold as death. -- Advisory:Action violence and unpleasant medical procedures.",1
"It takes integrity to bother making a good film when a bad one might have made just as much money. “Kong: Skull Island” is a smart sci-fi action movie that doesn’t rely on a handful of monsters and random scenes of computerized destruction to run out the clock. It has a smart script, imaginative filmmaking and a cast of fine actors who actually get to act. In a normal cinematic climate, this wouldn’t be a novelty, but sci-fi action has so degenerated in recent years that to see one that’s not a succession of undifferentiated explosions feels almost nostalgic, like a throwback to the 1990s (think “Jurassic Park”). But “Kong: Skull Island” is no throwback. It’s just movie-literate, informed by a number of techniques from across several decades, even as it makes full and inspired use of today’s CGI technology. Or to put it another way, King Kong has never looked so good. The action takes place in the 1970s, right after the end of American participation in the Vietnam War. John Goodman plays a spooky scientist who gets government funding to explore the seismology of an uncharted island, though he’s not really interested in earthquakes, but in monsters. He saw one or two in World War II and has been trying to prove it ever since.A team is assembled. There’s Samuel L. Jackson as a military officer, brooding about the loss of Vietnam, and Tom Hiddleston as a tracker hired to help out. Brie Larson plays a war photographer who becomes interested in the mission because she smells a story: “When three sources tell you the same thing word for word, you know they’re lying.” Along for the ride are lots of soldiers, multiple helicopters and unnamed characters, so that the monsters have plenty to chew on. If this were a “Star Trek” episode, 90 percent of the cast would be in bright red shirts.“Kong: Skull Island” signals that the movie is in good hands from the beginning. The characters are introduced with care and specificity, and the dialogue is sharp. An early scene, in which the helicopters pass through a ghastly electrical storm, isn’t just the usual thing of shaking cameras, smeary cuts and thunderous sound. As the leader of the crew, Jackson gets on the radio and soothes his men with a loopy speech, and director Jordan Vogt-Roberts indicates the gyration of the helicopter by showing a dashboard Richard Nixon bobblehead going up and down.There are other nice touches, too, such as the use of pop music on the soundtrack and a certain gallows-humor spirit among the men that calls to mind movies made around 1970 such as “MASH.” But the set piece to eliminate any doubt is the expedition’s first encounter with Kong, a kind of replay of the Empire State Building scene from the 1933 classic, only this time Kong has the home-field advantage.Military helicopters come at him from all sides, firing machine guns at him, and he swats them away. But this time, unlike in “King Kong,” we sometimes get the perspective from inside the aircraft (it’s not fun). The movie also finds various imaginative ways for Kong to deal with his attackers. Sometimes he swats. Other times he smashes two helicopters together. Sometimes he throws one into the other, and they both explode. In the movies, helicopters have always been the least safe form of transport, and “King Kong” adds another vivid chapter to that combustible history.The rest of the film — most of it — deals with the various characters getting the lay of the land, figuring out which monsters are bad, which are worse, and which are only sort of bad. There are sincere-looking water buffalo that are clearly OK, and on the other end of the spectrum is an absolutely disgusting spider that’s the size of an office building — it’s so convincing and so disgusting. Adding to the general festivity is John C. Reilly, as an aviator who has been stuck on Skull Island since 1944. Reilly’s performance is a comic delight, in that this aviator has been driven a little bit crazy — he can’t quite tell when he’s actually speaking and when he’s communicating thought telepathically. At the same time, he’s the only English-speaking person on the island with any idea as to what’s going on.There’s a little patch about two thirds in when “Kong: Skull Island” starts to drag, but it stops dragging within five minutes of one’s noticing “Hey, this thing is starting to drag.” Fortunately, it recovers — completely. Let’s hope that this action blockbuster sets the pattern for all that follow. ",1
"It's 1944, the waning days of World War II, and Veiko (Ville Haapasalo), a Finnish soldier, has been chained to a boulder and left to die -- his punishment for reluctance in battle. Ivan (Viktor Bychkov), a disgraced Soviet captain, escapes a bomb attack, and both men end up on an isolated reindeer farm run by Anni (Anni-Kristiina Juuso), a Lapp widow whose husband went to war and never came back. Russian filmmaker Alexander Rogozhkin opens his tale with a long, nearly wordless first act: Veiko's efforts to free himself from the boulder, then Anni's discovery of the presumed-dead Ivan. Brought together at Anni's lakeside compound, the threesome struggle through language barriers, partisan hostilities and the competition of the two men for for love-starved Anni. Cuckoo is what Ivan calls Veiko, whom he mistakes for a Nazi officer because of the uniform he was forced to wear. Veiko, in turn, tries to convince the uncomprehending Ivan that he's in fact a pacifist, that his true allegiance is to art and literature. I hope people look back in horror at what they did in the war, Veiko tells Ivan, quoting one of his literary gods, Dostoyevsky. There's a bit of Samuel Beckett austerity, some Ingmar Bergman mysticism, plus the war-as-ultimate-farce theme of No Man's Land. But Rogozhkin also brings a sweetness and humanity, and gives his tale a rarefied shimmer by setting it among the clear waters and vivid skies of Lapland. Shot by Andrei Zhegalov, the landscape is transformed into a place of pristine enchantment, a separate world where grown-up fairy tales such as this might spin out. Beautifully acted, a pleasure to watch, The Cuckoo is a rare gem that ought not to be neglected in the summer movie shuffle. -- This film contains partial nudity, mild sexual references and violence. -- Edward Guthmann  Romantic drama. Starring Jason Isaacs and Sofia Milos. Directed by Dan Ireland. (Rated PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Passionada is a romantic drama, a rare kind of film these days, even though romantic dramas were once a dominant genre in America. It's the love story of two adults, around 40, who each enter a relationship with some baggage. Location and culture add color -- the movie takes place in New Bedford, Mass., within that town's Portuguese American fishing community. Sofia Milos plays Celia, a widow and mother, whose husband died in a fishing accident. British actor Jason Isaacs, usually a dastardly villain (The Patriot), plays Charles, a down-on-his-luck gambler who sees Celia singing in a club one night and finds a door to his soul opening up. He pursues her; she resists. He mounts a charm offensive that includes, alas, lying. He says that he's rich and, most important, that he loves seafood. It happens so often in movies and so rarely in life: a relationship starts on the basis of a big lie. Perhaps it's just useful in terms of plotting. A lie in the first act makes for a good third-act crisis. In any case, director Dan Ireland enables Passionada to transcend formula by keeping the emotions strong and grounding them in a bright, specific world. There are town festivals, the sea and the sky and seafood everywhere -- and to jazz things up, now and again, there's the world of the blackjack table and the casino. Sofia Milos conveys Celia's pride, her loss, her reluctance and her blossoming passion. In one scene, we see her memories of herself as a young woman, frolicking with her husband, and then fade into the present day, as she looks at photos and remembers. Just by moving in a certain way, she is able to suggest, in the memory sequence, a woman some 10 or 15 years younger. That Isaacs is usually a heavy should not come as a surprise to anyone seeing him here. He may smile a lot in Passionada, but there's yet something untrustworthy in his look. Still, that works for Charles, who has been a shifty fellow most of his life and spends most of this movie lying through his teeth. -- This film contains sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle  Surf documentary. Starring Ken (Skindog) Collins, Laird Hamilton, Rochelle Ballard and Gerry Lopez. Written and directed by Dana Brown. (Not rated. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A bubble wash for the senses, an adrenaline rush for the mind, Step Into Liquid will have even the most landlocked goofy-footers wondering why they never learned to surf. It certainly looks appealing here. Big, curling waves, jolly attractive folks, and if things get too scary, you just kick it down into slow motion. Men, women and kids do it, and all over the world, too, from Ireland to Vietnam. This is a valentine to surfing from Dana Brown, son of the cupid of the sport, Bruce Brown, whose Endless Summer and Endless Summer II were the gold standard for surf flicks. What can Brown the Younger add? For starters, surf-ology has changed. Tow- in surfing means that riders (and cameramen) can get out to the monster waves way off shore by hitching a ride on a Jet Ski. It isn't just bigger waves, it is better footage of bigger waves and sound that will rattle your esophagus. Also, it is the 21st century. Women are no longer sitting on the beach, checking their tan lines. Even in the 1994 Endless Summer II, the female surfers were conspicuously missing. Brown makes an effort to find a group of top female surfers and takes to Tahiti's famous (in surf circles, anyhow) Teahupo'o Beach. These are no kiddy waves. As one surf veteran says in the movie in so many words, after watching the women, if they want to surf that, good luck, you ain't getting me out there. Brown digs a little deeper into social issues than the Endless clips, too. He follows the Malloy brothers to Ireland, of all places, where the three brothers, Chris, Keith and Dan, not only introduce some of the local kids to surfing but also invite Protestant boys and girls to join Catholic kids for the lessons. It is a good thought. Frankly, it is doubtful that an afternoon in the water changed the worldview of anyone, but at least he's not pretending it is all fun in the sun. If there is any knock on the production, that is it. To watch these gorgeous people skim across those magnificent waves, you'd think that surfing was a kind of cheerful, watery commune where everyone loves the ocean and gets along. As we know well here, wave rage is actually a serious and persistent problem. Having said that, anyone who goes to Liquid for social commentary is in the wrong movie. This is not only escapist fare, it is also heart-pounding, stunning stuff. There is simply no sport that is anything like surfing.

Starring Mike Vogel, Adam Brody and Jason London. Directed by Casey La Scala. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A grind is an impressive skateboarding maneuver that involves keeping balanced while running your axles against a ridged surface. It's also something your teeth will be doing during the majority of this movie, which attempts to combine the extreme sports visuals of a good Warren Miller ski film with the plot of a bad Tom Green picture and doesn't come close to landing on four wheels. Grind is a series of punishments and rewards -- for every 15 minutes of recycled gross-out slapstick, there's five minutes of skating to enjoy. Like every other film starring young people since Stand By Me, the movie follows four old friends on a road trip of self-discovery. Except instead of running across interesting people and places, they encounter as much excrement and vomit as is allowed in a PG-13 movie (it's more than you think). Main skater Eric Rivers (Mike Vogel) and his responsible friend Dustin (Adam Brody) are benign in their roles as recent high school graduates who use Dustin's college fund to follow a cross-country skating tour in hopes of getting discovered. Along they way, they encounter a series of D-list actors whose cameos seem lifted directly from their previous movies. Bobcat Goldthwait, Randy Quaid and the guy who played Ogre in Revenge of the Nerds don't have a funny line among them. The most humorous actor in the film, Joey Kern as Sweet Lou the cradle-robbing ladies' man, gets laughs only because he's performing a note-for-note rip-off of the Matthew McConaughey character in Dazed and Confused. The worst lines are saved for main comic relief Matt (Vince Vieluf), who is so incredibly grating you'll keep hoping someone behind the camera will jump into the scene and give the character the beating he deserves. The payoff for all of the above is watching stunt skater Brian Patch, who is carefully cropped throughout the film so you only see him from the neck down. Patch takes over skateboarding duties for Vogel in the movie's excellent handful of skating scenes, including the best sequence -- where our flatulent heroes turn their old beater van into a mobile skate park. And the tricked-out skateboarding finale does deliver, even if the rest of the film doesn't. -- This film contains sexual situations, crude language and violence. -- Peter Hartlaub ",1
"It's a refreshing change. Americans usually don't make romances unless they're comedies, as though love were too trivial to take seriously, or too embarrassing not to mock. But in XX/XY Chick presents the complicated nuances of a love affair, with events spanning 10 years, and he does so without apologizing. The movie begins in 1992, around the New York campus of Sarah Lawrence University. Mark Ruffalo plays Coles, a would-be artist who meets a young woman named Sam (Maya Stange) at a wild party. In true collegiate spirit, she suggests a menage a trois with her friend Thea (Kathleen Robertson). So right away everybody's happy: Coles, Sam, Thea and the audience. XX/XY shows us the glories and fault lines of Coles and Sam's relationship, then jumps 10 years to show the principal characters living different and sedate lives. Chick has clearly worked with the actors to suggest the differences between being in one's 20s and one's 30s. Stange goes from awkwardness to grace (and seems to have lost the 10 pounds that students gain in their freshman year). Coles goes from being a poetic wannabe to genuinely kind, and Thea goes from being wild and reckless to being fun-loving but considerate. Though the title suggests something emblematic in this story of Coles and the three women in his life -- the third is a live-in girlfriend (well played by Petra Wright) -- the movie is really a sexy, emotionally true portrait of a handful of people wrestling with their impulses and trying to find their way to happiness. It's a little story, but big enough for those of us who don't agree with Humphrey Bogart. . This movie contains nudity and harsh language. -- Mick LaSalle Crime thriller. Starring Alain Delon, Yves Montand, Andre Bourvil and Gian Maria Volonte. Directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. (Not rated. 140 minutes. At the Castro.) It's extraordinary that Le Cercle Rouge has taken 33 years to get a decent theatrical release in this country. Seen today, this crime thriller, from the French master Jean-Pierre Melville (Bob le Flambeur), is clearly a minor classic, mainly for reasons besides its crime story plot -- namely, the urbane fatalism of its cast and the overall mood of inevitability that hangs over every scene. It's subtitled, but the film speaks the language of cinema more than anything, so non-French speakers can get the soul of Le Cercle Rouge just by keeping two eyes open. In the decades since, students of Melville, such as John Woo and Quentin Tarantino, have amplified and sensationalized the director's work, but its soul and special feeling have eluded them. Today, what sets Melville apart -- aside from his meticulous compositions and inspired pacing -- is that, for all his wit and wry self-knowledge, his existentialism was no pose. He was absolutely alive to the philosophical implications of Le Cercle Rouge. Notions of fate, doom and honor were more important to him than the style aspect of guys in suits and hats carrying guns. Two men's paths cross, and they accept it as their destiny to ride together. Corey (Alain Delon) is released from prison on the same day that another man, Vogel (Gian Maria Volonte), escapes from police custody, and they help each other. Corey is wanted by the mob, and Vogel by the cops. At one point Corey hides Vogel in the trunk of his car, and Vogel does something that's astounding by modern standards, even by modern French standards. He gets into the trunk with a lit cigarette. Yves Montand plays a corrupt cop and a drunk who is recovering from the DTs when the fellows recruit him to be a marksman on their jewel heist (a wordless, methodical sequence that calls to mind Dassin's Rififi). It says something about the viewpoint and the psychological penetration of the film that the heist is his curative, and almost his redemption -- giving him purpose, meaning and not least of all, fellowship. This film contains nudity and violence. -- Mick LaSalle  Documentary. Directed by Damian Pettigrew. (Not rated. 110 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) Lovers of Federico Fellini's films will probably appreciate the approach taken by director Damian Pettigrew in his documentary Fellini: I'm a Born Liar. He's made a quasi-Fellini movie about Fellini, elliptical, poetic and unstructured, interspersing interviews with the maestro with some of the more dreamlike images from his films. The movie doesn't try to make a case for Fellini, it assumes that the case has been made. Nor does it attempt to introduce audiences to Fellini's life and work. I respect that strategy but found myself disappointed by it. As someone physically incapable of staying awake for an entire Fellini movie, I was hoping for some kind of elucidation. I wanted to be taken through it and be made to understand what it is that other people genuinely seem to love. Maybe they love Fellini himself, and that would certainly be understandable. In his interviews, shot the year before his death in 1993, Fellini is everything anyone could want in a foreign director. He's romantic, impish and amusing -- and behind his smile there's just the suggestion of a dark streak, someone who could be a real tyrant on the set. This is confirmed by Donald Sutherland, who says Fellini was awful to actors, a dreadful martinet. The documentary is best when it deals in specifics. Terence Stamp and Roberto Benigni tell funny stories of working with the director, and Stamp's imitation of Fellini is the film's highlight. But many of Fellini's own comments about his work are enthusiastic but vague and tell us little except that this was a man with a lifelong passion for putting his fantasies on celluloid. Like Fellini's own films, Fellini: I'm a Born Liar is occasionally brilliant, profiting from Fellini's distinct and unmistakable way of looking and seeing. But it goes in circles and wears out its welcome, except for the most hard-core enthusiasts. This film contains nudity and harsh language. -- Mick LaSalle In 2001, Onmyoji was the second-highest-grossing film in Japan after the Academy Award-winning Spirited Away. So bringing Onmyoji over here was worth a try. But it seems unlikely that this long, complicated dungeons and dragons story will capture much of an American audience. Certainly there are dueling wizards, torchlight swordfights and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon effects. But the moments of action are interspersed with lengthy plot developments that are hard to follow. It took a moment to realize what was so familiar about the pacing, but it makes perfect sense once you make the connection. This has the feel of one of those old cliff-hanger serials. And, it turns out, that's exactly what it is. Onmyoji is based on a famous set of Japanese serial novels. The concept is so popular that a sequel is already filming, comic book adaptations have been written and a TV series of the same name airs in Japan. What you get are all the staples of the genre -- villains who laugh maniacally, demonic transformations and lots of sword-swinging and blood. The costumes, which the filmmakers took great pains to make authentic for A.D. 1000, are gorgeous, although the extremely tall, pointed hats make the characters look a little like Smurfs. The word onmyoji refers to the sorcerers who work powerful magic to protect the emperor. They are also known as The Yin-Yang Masters, and although the film is also called The Yin-Yang Master, the distributor specifically requested that the Japanese title be used. -- C.W. Nevius ",1
"It’s a lucky thing for us that William Marston eventually created Wonder Woman; otherwise, we would never know his story. A movie needs a destination, and historically based movies need some kind of event or achievement to justify them, and to that end, the creation of Wonder Woman will suffice. But the real fascination here is Marston himself and the two women in his life.Here’s a case of people who were not just ahead of their time, but outside of time altogether. They chose a way of life that would be daring and unconventional today and would have been met with scorn even a generation ago. Yet they were living in the 1920s. “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women” is a story of courage and sacrifice, as well as a moving love story that’s really three love stories in one.It’s a very American tale in that it encapsulates about 150 years of American thinking with regard to sex and relationships. Marston and his wife, Elizabeth, and Olive Byrne, his student at Radcliffe, seem, in many ways, modern to us, but they were also riding a tide of Freudian thought that was just becoming mainstream in the 1920s. At the same time, their idealism about human possibility had echoes of early American social experiments, such as John Humphrey Noyes’ Oneida Community in the mid-19th century.As Marston, Luke Evans is a wide-eyed enthusiast, who at the start of the film is a psychology professor, teaching a theory of human personality that sounds more like an elaborate intellectualization of his own sexual proclivities. Basically, it’s an explanation of human behavior as a series of interactions based on impulses toward domination and submission. His wife (Rebecca Hall) is as caustic and funny as he is earnest, but they share an openness, a mutual sense of being revolutionaries on the front lines of thought. They have the excitement of people living together inside a great idea, and their mutual project is the development of what will become the lie detector. Credit must be given to writer-director Angela Robinson, who might be the first filmmaker ever to figure out how to use the polygraph as an erotic prop: Just hook up a prospective lover and ask the big questions — “Do you love me? Do you want to have sex with me?” — and watch the needle jump.Olive (Bella Heathcote) enters their lives as a 22-year-old research assistant. She is quiet and diffident, with a reflexive tendency to apologize all over herself. But she has an alto voice that gives the lie to her soprano looks, and that seems to be a metaphor for a personality with hidden depths. Plus, she has an encouraging pedigree: Her aunt was women’s rights activist Margaret Sanger, and her mother was a radical feminist.That’s the dramatis personae, and how they interact and how their story plays out is best discovered as it happens, because the surprises here have nothing to do with grand movements in the world, but of thought and emotion. It is worth noting, however, that when Marston finally does devise Wonder Woman, supposedly as a vehicle for his psychological theories, it looks more like an expression of bondage and submission fantasies. It’s amazing how something so radical could hide in plain sight and become so mainstream. Maybe there was something to Marston’s theories, after all.Robinson gets sterling performances from her cast, but the most striking — the one possibly deserving of end-of-year honors — is that of Rebecca Hall, who gives Elizabeth a powerful internal and external life. There’s drive, ambition and a huge personality and also conflict, fear and the possibility of anger. It’s the portrait of a great woman, forcibly contained by her times.Speaking of women and the times, we are still in that phase of seeing movies that were made in 2016, before the election. So we get a line in the movie — “Young women have the power to create their own destiny, to be president of the United States if they want” — that was clearly intended as a wink and a nod. But no one on our side of the screen is winking or nodding. ",1
"It’s a strange thing, the process of seducing an audience into accepting something. Just moments into “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” we are confronted with the spectacle of John Turturro dressed as an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. He looks about as comfortable in a headdress as he might if a pelican were standing on his head. Then he starts speaking, and it’s an unfamiliar English accent — because as we all know from movies, that’s how the ancient Egyptians talked.Yet within a few minutes, things start to change. Moses (Christian Bale) and his friend Ramses (Joel Edgerton) ride through Egypt in open chariots, and the ancient city looks so magnificent — with the monuments and the pyramids under construction — that we’re persuaded to accept anything. It’s not a question of believing it, exactly. Director Ridley Scott has simply made us want to be there, to wish we really were there, and to accept his illusion as the most ready answer to that desire. And so the next time Turturro shows up onscreen, we don’t think, “This is ridiculous,” but rather, “Oh, there’s the Pharaoh again.”Call this a victory of illusion over sense, but “Exodus: Gods and Kings” is a victory all the same, despite its suffering from the usual December disease of being 30 minutes too long. This time, fortunately, the weak slog doesn’t come at the end but in the middle. When Moses accepts his Jewish identity and meets his future wife, feel free to take a nap for a half hour. You won’t miss anything.A secular versionFor those new to the story, Moses starts life in the privileged classes, raised as the favorite of the Pharaoh and practically a brother to Ramses, the heir apparent. Though “Exodus,” of necessity, contains miracles that give evidence of a supreme being, the movie’s take on the material is decidedly secular. Thus, in a way that Cecil B. DeMille would never have considered, the movie makes us feel the appeal of a cushy life in a glorious civilization and what awfulness it would be to discover one was really born into the slave class.“Exodus” takes the proper time to lay its foundation, the relationship between Moses and Ramses. Handsome, brave and capable, Ramses is on the surface a magnificent fellow, but he knows he’s not really, and he knows Moses knows it. So when the rumors surface that the ostensibly Egyptian Moses was really a Jewish foundling, Ramses is quick to believe it, if only to get the one guy who sees through him out of town.Charlton Heston’s Moses was reflexively heroic. Christian Bale’s Moses is more like a very decent person who keeps adjusting to changing circumstances. In the Egypt of “Exodus,” the rulers live in splendor, and the Jews spend all day at hard labor, looking filthy and miserable. First, Moses must find himself as one with the Jewish people, and then he has to accept his role as their leader.After a strong opening and a sagging middle, “Exodus: Gods and Kings” regains its stride and surpasses itself in the last third, when the God of Abraham unleashes a series of calamities on Egypt and the royal household. In the almost 60 years since Cecil B. DeMille made “The Ten Commandments,” movies have gotten very good at creating seas of blood, frog infestations and plagues of locusts.Artistic plaguesBut the depiction of biblical horrors is not just a technical matter. It’s an artistic one, and this is where having a director who’s an artist, rather than a technician who just wants to lob bombs, becomes important. Passover, for example, is presented as a rolling blackness, slowly covering every street and home. This is the Angel of Death, and when it finally covers everything, Moses can hear the wailing and lamentation from miles way — as one would, in an age where they were no cars, and nights were silent. What’s missing in “Exodus” is religious fervor, any sense that the story is not merely interesting history, but something momentous, wonderful and glorious. Perhaps Scott just didn’t feel it and, unlike DeMille, felt no obligation to fake it. He should have, a little.",1
"It’s a tricky thing, and other movies have tried and failed, but “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” does it. It’s a sci-fi action movie that spoofs the form to strong comic effect, and yet it profits from every good thing about the genre it’s mocking. It tries to have it both ways, and it succeeds.The first “Guardians of the Galaxy” almost got there, but the jokes weren’t funny enough, and it leaned too much on the space battles. “Vol. 2” is wilder and more inspired. The emphasis is on the comedy, and the comedy is specific and directed this time, so we’re not just seeing generalized high spirits. The sci-fi action genre itself is the target, so that every time the movie seems to be going in a conventional direction — cranking up the soundtrack for the corny horns of hope — the legs are cut out, and the seriousness goes splat.Written and directed by James Gunn, based on the Marvel comic series, the movie gets off to a great start before the credits even roll. The guardians are preparing for an attack by some gigantic killer octopus, with rows and rows of teeth, and Groot is with them. Groot was a tree man all but killed in the last episode, but a twig was saved. Now the twig has grown into an oblivious toddler.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is racing into theaters worldwide this weekend. The movie has already posted impressive numbers at the international box offices. Vol. 2 is the second of what will become a trilogy before the story is told in its entirety. With Vol. 3 is in the works and is expected to release after the two-part Marvel Cinematic Universe culmination with Avengers: Infinity War and its sequel.Gunn shoots the ensuing battle by focusing almost entirely on Groot, as the baby twig dances to music and keeps coming within inches of getting squashed. The idea is funny, but the execution is even funnier, because the animation is so good that the dance itself is fun to watch. At the same time, Gunn gives himself the freedom to break from Groot for absurd little moments, as when Drax (Dave Bautista) comes up with a completely ridiculous strategy for killing the monster.Throughout the movie, the character of Drax is the source for some of the movie’s best laughs. An enormous muscleman (who avoids shirts because he has nipple sensitivity), he’s a wonderfully developed comic character, with a tendency to laugh uproariously at the most inappropriate moments and to say awful things to people with no awareness that he’s being offensive.“Guardians 2” finds a good story within which to frame its bits and laughs. In the previous installment, we met Peter (Chris Pratt), a space adventurer whose mother was dead and whose father was unknown to him. Now he gets to meet his dad. His name is Ego (Kurt Russell), and he has been searching for Peter for many years. Of course there are warning signs — the name, Ego, for one. But he seems genuine in his desire to be a real father after all these years. And he has a great living situation, an entire planetary paradise that he created with the power of his mind. He is a kind of god.“Guardians 2” throws a lot into the pot, but it keeps all the elements clear and finds ways to have fun at every turn. Michael Rooker has a nice role as an inter-space rogue who helped raise Peter but also terrorized him. Sylvester Stallone shows up for a couple of scenes as a major space honcho. Throughout the film, the people of a planet known as Sovereign keep figuring in the action. They are a perfect-looking and perfectly mannered golden people — very self-serious and thus the ideal foil for the movie’s irreverence.Yet amid all the irreverence, whenever the writer-director wants to be serious about something, he can do it. These dives into sentiment aren’t disconcerting or discordant, but seem sincere. Gunn creates a tonal atmosphere that gives him a wide range.He has good characters to work with, and he makes the most of them — not just Drax but Rocket (the shifty raccoon man voiced by Bradley Cooper); Peter, who is fun-loving but wears his needs on his sleeve; and Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who feels as much as Peter but is reserved in all the ways that he’s open. Near the end, the movie threatens to become the thing it parodies, with too much emphasis on the action, but it recovers completely. In recent years, the first Friday in May has become the start of summer blockbuster season. This is a solid beginning. They should all be as good as “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.”",1
"It’s best to mention this going in, that this is going to be a weird review. In it, I’m about to recommend a movie I would not see in a thousand years. I’d say a million, but I have no idea how a million would play out. But for sure, a thousand years would be too short a time to locate an impulse to see a movie called “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.”Of course, it might be different if “the Dying Girl” in question turned out to be the name of a boat, or a horse or a ballet. But no, this is a film about a teenage boy who is thrust into a friendship with a classmate who has an advanced case of leukemia. It would hardly seem possible, but the movie is often very funny, yet without diminishing for a moment the seriousness of the illness, or of illness in general. So just in terms of tone, “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” is a notable achievement.The movie walks several delicate lines at once, between farce and tragedy and comedy and drama. And it doesn’t even seem to be walking those lines so much as skipping and running along them, with an effortless sense of its own very specific truth. That kind of unself-conscious specificity can only be achieved by experienced hands or inspired novices, and in this case it was the latter. It is the first feature film by director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, from the first screenplay by Jesse Andrews, who adapted his own (debut) novel.Perhaps the key to the movie is that it’s not about average people experiencing something so bad that it’s interesting. It’s about characters who are interesting in themselves, experiencing something bad and inconvenient. Without the illness, these characters might have been worth a movie on their own.The “Me” of the title is Greg, through whom the story is told. As played by Thomas Mann, Greg is a fascinating mix — witty and clever, with a subterranean self-esteem and an elaborate strategy for surviving high school in spite of it. His idea is to be mildly friendly to everyone and engage with no one, except Earl (RJ Cyler), with whom he makes a series of short films. He never refers to Earl as his friend but as his business partner.The friendship with Rachel is forced on him. His mother is friends with her mother, and when the word comes that Rachel is sick, his mother insists that he go to see her. Rachel doesn’t want to be visited, and Greg has nothing to say to her, but gradually they find they have things in common — an arch sense of humor, an appreciation of art, an outsider’s angle on things.Stories in which one person’s illness makes someone else a better person tend to be, by their nature, obnoxious, in that they miss the point. The crisis is about the sick person and what they’re going through, not about what gems of the spirit can be gleaned from another’s suffering. Yet, though “Me and Earl” conforms to that basic pattern, it doesn’t offend, possibly because Rachel cares about Greg as much as the viewer does, and possibly because the movie doesn’t ever try to make sense of Rachel’s illness. Leukemia is never anything other than terrible, something that sometimes can be ignored, and sometimes can’t.Gomez-Rejon matches the wit of the script with gently witty touches, such as the clever use of a fishbowl lens. He also relies on his actors for long takes, which give the movie a lived-in, naturalistic feeling. One particularly tasteful touch is his way of filming the door opening to Rachel’s room each time Greg visits. It creates a breathless sense of not knowing what to expect.So this is a very worthy movie, not that this will hold any sway with illness-phobes, who’d rather stare at the wall for 105 minutes than see a good movie about sickness. Still, it’s safe to say that “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” will be enjoyed by everyone — who doesn’t deliberately avoid it.",1
"It’s not a new thing for Casey Affleck to be great in a movie. He was great in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” and in “Gone, Baby, Gone.” In fact, even before “Manchester by the Sea,” he was already great twice this year, in two movies that aren’t the kind that get nominations — a crime thriller, “Triple 9,” and a survival thriller, “Finest Hours.” But in “Manchester by the Sea,” Affleck’s performance, as a janitor in hardscrabble Massachusetts, is too outstanding and too at the center of everything to escape recognition. It’s a role that calls upon his rare ability to convey absolute focus — a jittery, locked-in, volatile kind of attention — with a quality of distraction, of some troubling thought weighing on him in the background. In this film, in almost every moment on screen, his dual consciousness is present, because here he’s playing a man with a trauma in his past, a pain that he can’t ignore or escape.Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan (“Margaret”), “Manchester by the Sea” breaks the usual rules of storytelling. Other movies about tragedy are ultimately about overcoming tragedy, and if not about recovery then at least about getting through it and on to some kind of meaningful existence. That’s an approach that satisfies the demands of drama, the expectation that a protagonist grow and change and move forward.But that approach ignores an aspect of life that we might prefer not to think about, or see onscreen, but that we know is true. People don’t always recover. Some things are so awful that recovery is simply not possible. Likewise, in the aftermath of tragedy, most people aren’t completely destroyed. They don’t end up in a ditch or in a straitjacket. They simply remain at a base level of pain that never ends, that never gets better and never gets worse. So how do you make a drama out of that? How do you give that a beginning, middle and end?This is the task that Lonergan assumes for himself. “Manchester by the Sea” is about a man who is stuck, and the movie is about being stuck, so that anything cheerful or even hopeful would be out of place. Thus, the drama, such that there is, must come in two forms. The first is the drama of revelation: We see this odd guy, and gradually the story tells us, through flashback, how he got to be the way he is. We become curious, and the movie slowly answers our curiosity.The second source of drama is in wondering what this guy is going to do next, and this is where Affleck’s performance becomes not only sensitive and perfectly calibrated but a major source of the film’s propulsion. Lee (Affleck) always looks like he is about to explode. Usually, he doesn’t. But he carries an energy with him that isn’t safe, that’s alert to any slight or obfuscation.Watch him and also watch the other actors respond to him in an early scene, in which he shows up at the hospital and finds out that his older brother has died. His face looks like he’s trying to find someone to blame. There’s no dialogue to support this. It’s just in his look and bearing. And everyone — the nurses, the doctors, the close friends who are there — looks uneasy. They’re not afraid of him. He’s not a maniac. He’s not dangerous. But everyone can take a deep breath and relax only when he’s finally out of the room.Most of the action of “Manchester By the Sea” revolves around Lee’s inheriting custody of his 16-year-old nephew. It’s something he neither wants nor expects. He is working in Quincy, Mass. Taking on custody means relocating to Manchester, where he has an unfortunate history. And unlike what every other movie might do, “Manchester by the Sea” does not present this custody situation as a transformative experience. It doesn’t make everyone nicer. The kid (Lucas Hedges) is a sensible teenager, a bit full of himself and not happy about having his life held hostage to the whims of a ne’er-do-well uncle. Their interaction — skeptical, borderline hostile, but familial — is lively and a source of some welcome humor.But mostly, this is a sad film, and sometimes a frustrating one, as our frustration with the character spills over into frustration at the movie itself. Affleck is magnificent, but the movie is something less than that, because it can’t completely overcome some built-in challenges. Even so, “Manchester by the Sea” deserves honors for being so different, and for working on the mind in a particular way: To remember this film, days later, doesn’t feel like remembering a movie. It feels like remembering actual people you once knew.As such, memories stand out. The memory of Lee’s coming back from a fishing trip and greeting his wife and three kids. The memory of that same wife, years later — a heartrending Michelle Williams, in one of the year’s great scenes — telling Lee that, despite their divorce, she needs to be in contact with him. And those moments, just a flicker, when Lee almost cracks, and Affleck lets us see just how deep this pain goes.It goes as deep as forever.",1
"It’s not enough to say that “Allied” is set in the 1940s. It’s set in the 1940s of collective imagination. A fair portion of it takes place in “Casablanca.” The musical score, by Alan Silvestri, has the sadness and portent of the music heard in classic World War II documentaries such as “The World at War.” There’s a lushness to the photography that feels like a color analogue to the soft-focus black-and-white photography of Hollywood in the war years. Most important of all, “Allied” finds actual movie stars for the lead roles, and director Robert Zemeckis treats them like movie stars, making their faces the locus of all meaning and their interaction the stuff of romantic fantasy. He creates a movie that is old-fashioned in every possible good way, but that in no way seems passe or cliched.  Coming off of “Allied,” there were rumors that its stars, Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, were having an affair during its making. Assuming that’s not true, it’s still understandable how people could think so, or even want it to be true. In the midst of a movie-made romantic atmosphere and depicting the kind of life-and-death stakes that can only intensify an aura of excitement and longing, Pitt and Cotillard make us believe that something is building between them from their first moments onscreen. Written by Steven Knight (“Eastern Promises,” “Locke”) and loosely based on real events, “Allied” begins with a covert operation in Morocco. Max (Pitt), a Canadian fluent in French, is parachuted into the desert and makes his way into Casablanca. With a quick shave and a change of clothes, he looks as impeccable as Cary Grant. He goes to the rendezvous point, a nightclub, where he meets the fellow spy posing as his wife, Marianne (Cotillard). There’s no better express train to intimacy than posing as a married couple.  The Casablanca mission is almost incidental to the path of the larger story, but Zemeckis and Knight lavish time on it, and they’re right to do so. The long lead-up to the big event is also the couple’s entrance chute into real emotional closeness, and the very fact that they’re resisting the attraction and fighting the impulse makes us eager for them to just give in already. The combustion finally happens inside an old sedan in the middle of a dust storm, and it might well be the most satisfying movie love scene of 2016. The bulk of the film takes place in London, but again, this is not the workaday London of reality. This is the London of officers who talk like Terry-Thomas (remember him?), the London whose skies look like a fireworks display at night, with British Hurricanes and Spitfires defending the city against German invaders. Only later can we appreciate Zemeckis’ accomplishment here: He crafts a mood so heightened that it in no way seems histrionic, but merely appropriate, that the scene of a woman giving birth takes place on a London street during an air raid, with buildings collapsing all around. Most of “Allied’’ revolves around the question of trust and belief. Max and Marianne, after their Casablanca adventure, relocate to London and assume the life of a normal couple. But then one day, British intelligence informs him that Marianne is under suspicion of being a German double agent. Max makes it his mission to prove her innocent, but the issue is complicated by the fact that this is a woman he has seen lie with charm and grace. He has also seen her shooting a machine gun at people at a party — a party of her supposed friends. So he knows she’s not a normal person. He just doesn’t know what kind of not-normal.  From that situation — is she or isn’t she, and a loving husband’s desperate effort to prove that she’s not — “Allied” builds a series of tense adventures, as well as two-person scenes between Pitt and Cotillard that are fraught with an underlying urgency. To describe Cotillard’s performance would almost necessitate revealing the ultimate turn of Marianne’s character. Better to put it this way: Throughout we’re never entirely sure about Marianne, and yet by the end, we realize that Cotillard and Zemeckis have not given us a single false note or misdirection.  Cotillard is remarkable, and Pitt does everything a movie star can do, which is what most movie actors can’t do. He’s the audience’s stand-in, the person viewers are content to be for two hours. He makes us care and then shows us that he cares as much as we do, maybe even more. Needless to say, we believe him. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic.

"It’s quite possible that Steve Jobs was a jerk, but it’s hard to imagine he was precisely the kind of jerk that we find in “Steve Jobs.” In this imaginative riff, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin as a kind of three-act play, Jobs is relentlessly unpleasant, unreachable and uninspiring, not a visionary so much as a sleek, nasty businessman — but he’s entertaining. He is always entertaining.In “Steve Jobs,” the screenwriter’s signature is as obvious as in a Preston Sturges or Woody Allen film. The characters all sound exactly as if they’re in an Aaron Sorkin movie, pingponging wisecracks, pithy observations and casual but devastatingly accurate putdowns, and to say that this is anything less than delightful would be churlish. In its 122 minutes, “Steve Jobs” is never a great film, but it never becomes tiresome. When the soundtrack pumps up to tell us that it’s about to end, it leaves the audience wanting more. The film takes place on three different days, Jobs’ product launches in 1984, 1988 and 1998, and aside from very brief flashbacks — literally, just a flash here and there — the film stays contained, playing out in real time within each act. Jobs (Michael Fassbender) moves restlessly from room to room, steamrolling and threatening people (never charming them), as the important figures from his life turn up to be abused, ask for favors or tell him off. Actually, sooner or later everyone gets to do all three. There’s Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), trying to put lightning in a bottle as Jobs’ boss; Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), the technical brain behind the home computer, who tells Jobs that he is tired of being thought of as Ringo when he is really John; and Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), his marketing director and the closest thing he has to a friend. The movie tries to locate its heart in Jobs’ relationship with his out-of-wedlock daughter, Lisa (played at different ages by different actresses). He starts off rejecting her and denying his paternity in a callous way, but gradually thaws, at least somewhat. Actually, the movie does find its way to some emotion through this strain, but Sorkin and Boyle overplay it, by trying to make it the movie’s overarching story, the emblem of its hero’s personal progress over 14 years. They can’t succeed, because there’s neither enough drama nor transformation in the relationship, but also because the audience’s interest is limited. We’d rather know abut the guy who invented the iPod. As Jobs, Fassbender is fine on his terms, as the embodiment of Sorkin’s vision. He’s quick, brilliant and impervious, and the matinee-idol looks don’t hurt. Just breezing through the room, his Jobs is an impressive man. What he lacks is the thing that the film probably didn’t need but that the real Steve Jobs did need and had. Fassbender isn’t endearing. He’s not someone you love in spite of yourself. He’s not boyish and charming. Ashton Kutcher, playing the same role in a lesser movie (“Jobs” from 2013), had these qualities. He made you understand why people bothered to put up with him. By contrast, people put up with Fassbender’s Jobs because he’s the boss, or because, like Hoffman, they like him for inexplicable reasons.Some of the best scenes take place between Jobs and Wozniak, who are more like McCartney and Lennon than they realize, with each possessing necessary qualities that the other lacks, and each both resenting and loving the other guy for it. Rogen conveys a sweetness of nature and a forgiving awareness of Jobs’ strengths and weaknesses, while Fassbender looks at him as though he were some piece of ungainly but essential equipment best kept under a drape. At one point, in passing, he refers to him as Rain Man.Boyle films the proceedings on a slightly grainy stock that gives the movie just the hint of a documentary. There’s propulsion and energy. He takes Sorkin’s script and pumps it with amphetamines. The movie’s biggest weakness is that it ends too soon. “Steve Jobs” is the second Jobs film to not include its inventor’s great 21st century innovations, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. To be sure, “Steve Jobs” has its own integrity as the story of the young innovator, but it’s a little like making a movie about Thomas Edison and stopping somewhere between the phonograph and the lightbulb.",1
"It’s rare to see a movie that has the power to surprise, and surprise, and surprise. The surprises in “The Nice Guys” aren’t the surprises of story, though the story is varied enough to be unpredictable. The surprises rather have to do with unexpected lines or sight gags topped by other lines and sight gags. They have to do with radical, expertly executed shifts in tone.For these reasons, “The Nice Guys” is a hard movie to describe. The performances are good, better than good, but this is not a movie about performances. Audiences will walk out of the film pleased, but not transformed. It’s not a great movie. An action comedy, it doesn’t have a great movie’s half-life, and it doesn’t produce that great movie glow. But its constant invention and originality are indeed great, and so is the pleasure they produce.It’s a movie unlike any other, besides “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” (2005) from the same writer-director, Shane Black. Along with co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi, Black creates in “The Nice Guys” an atmosphere that allows for farce, slapstick, silly wordplay and genuine and weirdly effective sentiment. And this is something you might not realize until it’s over — you won’t have time to realize it: There’s no dead time, no scenes that are merely functional, there to set up other scenes. Every scene is enjoyable, containing its own little kick or twist, and everything is always rushing forward.Russell Crowe is Healy, a genial strong-arm guy for hire, who works for himself, eking out a living breaking arms and punching people in the face. Ryan Gosling is Holland, an inept private investigator. One is smart and silent, the other talkative and not too bright. Their paths cross violently — the buddy movie equivalent of meeting cute — but soon they realize that they share a common interest. They each need the other to solve a case that threatens them both.As a filmmaker, Black is immersed in the Los Angeles film noir tradition, and he knows how to play off expectations. He knows the conventions he has to deliver on and the ones he can upend, and he seems to have a second-by-second understanding of an audience’s thinking. As with some of the famous noir films of the 1940s, most notably “The Big Sleep,” the plot of “The Nice Guys” isn’t important. The only thing important about it is that it seems important in the moment.Set in 1978, it captures the 1970s milieu, not just with the cars and the clothes, but with a story that involves a series of murders within the fringes of the porn industry. As in most Los Angeles noir, the story’s range is big enough to incorporate low life and high life and to suggest that the two are closer than people think. But the experience of “The Nice Guys” is mostly that of shocked laughter. It’s a bombardment of audacity and outrageous humor that never lets up.Gosling is the comic — mostly, but not always, the idiot — and Crowe is the straight man, and the two work well enough together that a sequel seems inevitable. (Black’s first screenplay was for “Lethal Weapon,” which became a franchise.) But Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling’s intelligent and highly moral 12-year-old, deserves a special mention. The character is an unexpected presence that adds dimension to the story, and Rice plays her beautifully. ",1
"JCVD: Satire. Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Directed by Mabrouk El Mechri. In English and French with English subtitles. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As a sophisticated moviegoer, you probably aren't thinking about seeing the new Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. But no. Really. Think about it.  JCVD is not an action movie but a shrewd satire about stardom and the cult of celebrity. It tells the story of an action star who is still famous, and yet something of a has-been. A man who still has fans, but who has serious career problems. A man who is recognized everywhere, but as much for his failures as his successes. A man who could probably spend the rest of his life making good money in pictures, but in low-budget, demeaning productions that are beneath him.  In other words, it's about Jean-Claude Van Damme, who is played by none other than Jean-Claude Van Damme, who does so with great self-effacement and a battle-scarred humility. Van Damme brings to the film a weary sense of humor and an emotional facility that we haven't seen from him before. Alert the media: Van Damme is an actor. Not just a muscleman, not just a martial artist, but someone with access to a rich internal life that's manifest on his once smooth and now rugged 47-year-old face. Seriously, if JCVD doesn't signal some kind of turnabout in Van Damme's career, there is no justice.  This guy always had potential. He started in the mid-1980s in low-budget action thrillers, and by the mid-1990s he'd become a major box-office draw, poised to cross over into mainstream movies. He was the star of John Woo's first American film, Hard Target (1993), and of Peter Hyams' Timecop (1994). But then, within a few years, it all seemed to fall apart. There were marital troubles, drug problems and career problems, and Van Damme soon fell off the Hollywood radar. He continued making movies, but of the kind that get big rollouts in Romania and go straight to video in the United States. He hasn't had a movie released here in a decade. JCVD acknowledges this. When he talks to his American agent, Van Damme tells him he doesn't want to work in cheap movies where his salary makes up two-thirds of the production budget. I'd rather work for scale. Just get me in a studio. Meanwhile, he keeps losing roles to other actors - even Steven Seagal, who undercuts him by promising to lose his ponytail for the first time ever. Director Mabrouk El Mechri's camera searches Van Damme's face for clues to the mystery: What is it like to have none of the real advantages of stardom, such as the chance to do great work, while retaining all the disadvantages, like pushy fans and the loss of anonymity? Van Damme's face gives the answer: It's exhausting. The exhaustion is physical, too. Take the movie's witty opening, in which Van Damme is seen on a film set. We meet him in the midst of a ridiculously long take in which he fights dozens of assailants and kills dozens more. And then, just as the shot is in its last seconds, a piece of the set collapses, and he has to start all over again. It's very difficult for me to do everything in one shot, he tells the young, impassive director. I'm 47 years old. Aside from some flashbacks, most of JCVD takes place in Van Damme's hometown in Belgium. In the midst of personal turmoil and professional disappointment, he stumbles into a real-life drama straight out of one of his movies - a bank robbery that turns into a hostage situation. Suddenly the guns have real bullets, and the bad guys might win. Outside the bank, fans line up, chanting Van Damme's name as though it were a sporting event. JCVD is rich with the irony, distortions and various strangenesses of fame.  But the film goes deeper than surface irony. In one of 2008's single best shots, Van Damme speaks his inner monologue directly into the camera. He talks about what it's like to be a big shot, how that can distort a person. He talks about the allure of drugs and about having seen so much of life that he can't judge anybody - even though everyone can't help judging him. JCVD is a film that tells us that celebrities can be much more than the shorthand distillations we get from movies and publicity. But it doesn't only say it. It demonstrates it. -- Advisory: This film contains violence.",1
"JUDY BERLIN: Romance. Starring Edie Falco, Aaron Harnick and Madeline Kahn. Directed by Eric Mendelsohn. (Not rated. 97 minutes. At the Galaxy.) The picture, which opens today, takes place in a middle- class Jewish neighborhood in suburban Long Island, and it follows a handful of people over the course of a single day. Nothing much happens, and everything happens. Mendelsohn presents us with a universe in which the surface remains tranquil and melancholic even as the underlying emotions run passionate and deep. Edie Falco of TV's The Sopranos plays Judy, a 32-year-old would- be actress who plans to leave that night for the coast. Ingenuously, she tells a friend about how she wants to channel her energies in to film, though she has never even been near a movie camera. The role of a sweet-natured innocent is a departure for Falco, who is not only endearing but very funny. At one point we see Judy at her job, performing at a restored colonial fairground. As a tour guide explains the plight of colonial women, Judy mimes churning butter and milking cows. Falco gives a wonderful imitation of amateur acting. Judy runs into an old school friend, David (Aaron Harnick), a depressed 30-year-old who dreams of becoming a filmmaker. Their interaction is the weakest link in the film -- the stammered courtship ritual is reminiscent of Woody Allen's movies, and for no reason. Mendelsohn has no need to imitate anybody. The strongest element of Judy Berlin revolves around David's mother, Alice, played by the late Madeline Kahn as the apotheosis of all the ditzy women in her filmography. We always knew there was a soulfulness behind Kahn's zaniness, and here we understand it. Even as she prattles on, there's a watchfulness to Kahn's performance suggesting powerful strains of longing. When Alice walks down a deserted street on an afternoon darkened by a solar eclipse -- singing to herself, Sixteen again, I'll never be/ Till apples grow on cherry trees -- it's a moment of pure cinematic poetry. The effect is made all the more potent by our knowledge of Kahn's premature death. It's hard to imagine a more graceful exit for a lovely comic actress. Judy Berlin is filmed in black and white, giving it an otherworldly stamp. At one point, David, a stand- in for the filmmaker, tells Judy that he'd like to make a documentary about the town, a film with no plot that would somehow convey the place's beauty and splendor. It comes as a surprise to hear a filmmaker reveal his intentions so nakedly and audaciously. Mendelsohn's confidence was not unwarranted. With no self-protective cynicism or irony, he makes us believe that the world of Judy Berlin is indeed a lovely place. .. ",1
"JUNGLE BOOK 2 Animated musical. Voices by John Goodman, Haley Joel Osment and Phil Collins. Directed by Steve Trenbirth. Written by Karl Geurs. (Rated G. 90 minutes. At AMC Van Ness, Metreon, Century 20 Daly City and Century Plaza 10.) If you loved the original, rent it, then run it backward, because that's what they do here. In 1967 the jungle boy, Mowgli (here Haley Joel Osment of The Sixth Sense), was in the wild and is enticed into the village. Here he's in the village and is lured into the jungle. Complications ensue. After all these years, Mowgli hasn't grown an inch. Or gotten a haircut. He capers around the huts, making moony eyes at the lovely Shanti (Mae Whitman from Independence Day) and wondering about these weird feelings that have him both attracted to her and yet pulled to go back to the jungle. Meanwhile, deep in the bush, Baloo (John Goodman of Monsters Inc.) is still singing and dancing, although he mopes that it isn't the same without his little buddy. Frankly, if anyone needs a girlfriend, it is Baloo, but that's a different movie. Baloo and Mowgli get back together, the evil tiger Shere Khan threatens everyone, and musical numbers break out at the drop of a mango -- just like the first version. There is really only one surprising moment. Singer Phil Collins appears as the voice of Lucky the vulture. You'd never guess it was him. Of course, the roly-poly Goodman, with the gravely voice of Wolfman Jack channeling John Wayne, was born to play Baloo. But couldn't he get some funny lines? In fact, there's hardly a laugh in the whole show. It is also a dubious choice to stick with the idea of the jungle gang as jazz hepcats, as in the first Book. The musical soundtrack is right out of Cab Calloway, including characters shouting, Crazy man, crazy! or You dig? Today's preteens may wonder what all the digging is about. If anything, this is a kind of period piece for cartoon aficionados. The animation is mostly retro, lovingly hand-rendered backdrops and scenes, but the sad fact is they look a little drab compared with today's splashy computer graphics. Computer imaging was used for the big production number W-I-L-D, but let's just say if that song is nominated for an Oscar we are in a musical drought of Sahara-like proportions. The best tune in the whole 90 minutes comes from the band Smash Mouth over the closing credits. It would be a nod to today except that Smash Mouth, a Disney favorite, is so totally five minutes ago. And two, the song they do, Wanna Be Like You, is from the original movie. The overall result of this remake is something as safe and dull as oatmeal. Now that today's kids have seen SpongeBob SquarePants, are they really going to be entranced by a dancing blue bear? -- C.W. Nevius  Film noir. Starring Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier. Directed by Henri- Georges Clouzot. (Not rated. 102 minutes. At the Castro.) . Quai des Orfevres (1947) is an excellent film noir from Henri-Georges Clouzot, the French director best known for The Wages of Fear (1952) and Diabolique (1955). Quai shares with those masterpieces a sophisticated understanding of human psychology and, if anything, has an even greater sense of atmosphere. Viewers acquainted with American film noir will be struck immediately by the contrasts on display here. While American noirs ache with the spiritual desolation of World War II and fear of the Atomic Age, in Quai des Orfevres the war is not a spiritual problem but an almost tangible presence. As viewers, we're invited to look at streets that three years earlier had been under German authority. We can feel the history of that trauma in the demeanor of the characters, who are loose and carefree and yet worn out and melancholy. Citizens who have just gotten over five years of terror are not going to worry much about enforcing morality; thus, the adult nature of this 1947 noir has no American equivalent. We first meet our flighty heroine, Jenny (Suzy Delair), as she entertains a music hall audience with a jolly song that seems to be about her genitalia. Her best friend (Simone Renant) is a lesbian, and her husband (Bernard Blier, the father of director Bertrand Blier) is a long- suffering musician who puts up with his wife's flirtations. The film -- whose title (literally embankment of the goldsmiths) is the Parisian equivalent of Scotland Yard -- revolves around an investigation into the death of a sleazy producer. Jenny, her husband and her best friend all have things to hide about the night in question, and though their alibis seem tight, a police detective (Louis Jouvet) is getting closer to the truth with every question. Along the way we get more than a glimpse of two shadowy worlds -- the music hall and the police investigation unit -- which are both presented as run-down and crawling with misfits. But in this case, the treatment is ultimately forgiving. . This film contains adult, ribald humor. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Jarhead: Drama. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Sam Mendes. (R. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its scope is small. It doesn't purport to tell the whole truth about war, warriors or the 1991 Gulf War in particular, but rather of one man's experience. But within its limits, Jarhead has the ring of truth and shows us things we haven't seen, that no one would or could make up. One example: A sniper is about to kill somebody, when his orders are changed, and he's told to stand down. He dissolves into tears and throws a tantrum. He really wanted to kill somebody, and they're not letting him. It's a cruel world. Peter Sarsgaard plays the disappointed sniper, and the scene in which he comes apart is one of many powerful yet peculiar moments in director Sam Mendes' exceptionally well-acted drama. Jarhead straddles a strange line: It's a straight, almost deadpan presentation of events so extreme they border on the surreal. Seeing it, one can understand why anti-war books and films are often satirical and fantastic -- that would be the way a rational mind would make sense of the experience. The great virtue of Jarhead, which some will mistake as a fault, is that it doesn't try to make sense of it. Neither does it try to make something senseless of it. The invigorating thing about Jarhead is it makes us encounter the truth in its undigested form. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford, who joins the Marines for vague reasons and immediately has his doubts. Barracks life doesn't provide the idyllic microcosm of America depicted in World War II movies but a collection of sexually frustrated, confused and angry young men, who, between pulling pranks and missing the whole point of Apocalypse Now, are bored out of their skulls. As in no other war movie I can remember, the youth of these guys is emphasized, so that when their superiors speak to them -- such as their sardonic sergeant (Jamie Foxx) or their genial lieutenant colonel (Chris Cooper) -- we recognize the effort of adults straining to make themselves understood to kids. Because Swofford's experience has no internal logic, the film moves forward as a series of incidents, leading to war. That feels right. Without being boring, the movie captures the boredom of being stuck in the desert, waiting. The pressure brings out everyone's worst. Those who were evil and stupid to begin with become more evil and more stupid. Evan Jones is distressingly good as a Marine who revels in scorpion fights and in killing camels. The disrespect for life is not something he has to grow into. It's something that's his from the start, and patriotism is just his cover story, a scoundrel's last refuge. Even Swofford, who's comparatively reasonable, longs to see the pink spray -- and that's before he's deployed. Once in the desert, fearing what's to come and panicked about the possibility of losing his girl back home, he's on a razor's edge. The sequence in which he almost murders a fellow Marine and then regrets it is brilliantly and unexpectedly acted by Gyllenhaal. Eventually, the whole film is cast in an eerie glow, as the oil fires reflect off the desert sand, bathing everything in a gold light. A horse appears out of nowhere -- it seems to be shining, but that's only because it's covered in oil. At one point, the staff sergeant looks out onto the burning oil fields and says to Swofford, I love this job. The moment is neither ironic nor heroic. The movie's perspective is Swofford's perspective -- confusion, ambivalence -- and for once ambivalence feels right. The ambivalence runs deep. Jarhead, at least to a degree, blows the myth of the noble warrior. Yet it also suggests that a nation depends on that myth and its appeal to certain kinds of impressionable people. So that at the end of his experience, Swofford doesn't know if he's been enhanced or played for a sucker. Neither do we. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, violence and strong language. ",1
"Jason Clarke as Howard, Tom Hardy as Forrest and Shia LaBeouf as Jack in LAWLESS Photo: Richard Foreman, Jr., SMPSP  (L-R) JASON CLARKE, TOM HARDY and SHIA LaBEOUF star in LAWLESSJason Clarke as Howard, Tom Hardy as Forrest and Shia LaBeouf as Jack in LAWLESS Photo: Richard Foreman, Jr., SMPSP (L-R) JASON CLARKE, TOM HARDY and SHIA LaBEOUF star in LAWLESS Drama. Starring Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain and Guy Pearce. Directed by John Hillcoat. (R. 115 minutes.)In the collective imagination, Prohibition happened in black and white and in big cities like New York and Chicago. There were passwords to get into speakeasies, and glamorous nightclubs where people drank booze out of teacups. The violence was glamorous, too, and perpetuated by larger-than-life gangsters who wore spats, fired machine guns out of car windows and drove off before the cops arrived. Lawless has nothing to do with that side of Prohibition. Instead it makes vivid and real a Prohibition of earth tones, full of stone-faced, monosyllabic people with dirty collars. In Lawless, nothing feels safer than the open woods - until the moment people find they're not alone, and then forget about the cops ever showing up. Forget about anybody showing up, when there's not a soul anywhere within screaming distance.  Based on The Wettest County in the World by Matt Bondurant, which was in turn based on the real-life exploits of his bootlegging ancestors, Lawless was adapted by musician Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat. Cave and Hillcoat previously collaborated on The Proposition, a film that, with its rural setting, uncompromised violence and emphasis on family, has more than a passing resemblance to Lawless. Three brothers in Franklin County, Va., go into business selling moonshine out of common glass jars - nothing fancy going on here. Forrest Bondurant (Tom Hardy) is strong and implacable. The youngest brother, Jack (Shia LaBeouf), is engaging and enterprising, someone who would be at home in the city. And middle brother Howard (Jason Clarke) is just sort of there, as an extra guy to have in a scene. At the start of the movie, the Bondurant brothers aren't the enemy, as far as local law enforcement is concerned. They are the economy. And all goes well until one day a city slicker from Chicago shows up, charged with drying up the county. Special Agent Charlie Rakes is portrayed by Guy Pearce as a grotesque vision of an urban man, dandified, perfumed and carefully coiffed. It's as if we're seeing, not what this character is, but how the Bondurants might see him, as someone who might as well be a space alien. Throughout that's something very much felt in Lawless, the cultural distance between city and country that existed before communications and transportation made the world into one big town. About a third into the film, Jessica Chastain shows up as a city woman relocating to the country in order to find some peace (lotsa luck). Her clothes, her hair, her lipstick and her air of independence make her into a vision of desirability and color amid the dullness, dust and dirt. It's another strong performance from Chastain, who in the last 18 months has had the best rollout of an actress since Meryl Streep. When the dandified special agent rolls into town, he gives the Bondurants a choice: Either they start kicking a portion of their profits to him, or he will have them destroyed. Hardy, as Forrest, is thoroughly convincing as one of those people who cannot be pushed around - giving in doesn't even enter his head as a possibility - and so most of Lawless depicts a war, one no less bloody for its unraveling at a distinctly measured Southern pace. But Hillcoat and Cave give us more than an action story. They create a world. In Jack's courtship of a religiously devout young woman (Mia Wasikowska), we're back 80 years ago, even as we see, in Jack's vanity and in his desire for the trappings of success, the emergence of the modern man. The filmmakers detail a long-gone conflict from a long-lost era and end up showing how the dreams and longings that motivate Americans never really change.",1
"Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past.Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Action. Starring Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart. Directed by Bryan Singer. (PG-13. 131 minutes.) The future, as we all know from movies, is either murky green or murky blue, and so we begin X-Men: Days of Future Past in murk - a murk exacerbated by dark 3-D glasses. The war between humanity and the mutants is coming to the end, and now the mutants are down to a skeleton crew. For some reason, this is presented onscreen as something really sad, even though the movie was made for an audience not of mutants but of human beings. For the first 10 minutes, the new X-Men doesn't look promising. A mix of gloom and commotion, it's dark and colorless, with an opening battle scene between Sentinels and mutants that takes place long before we have any reason to root for either. But then, very quickly, the movie locks into a time-travel story that accomplishes two very welcome things simultaneously: (1) It gets us out of the murky blue future and back to the sunlit vistas of 1973; and (2) It takes the aging characters and rejuvenates them. It gives them entirely new bodies. Thanks to his physical resiliency - time travel is like air travel, only a thousand times more punishing - it's Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who gets the task of going back in time to alter the pivotal event in mutant-human relations, the assassination of an anti-mutant scientist (Peter Dinklage) by Raven (Jennifer Lawrence).Wolverine's assignment is to meet up with the earlier incarnations of the mutant sages, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), and persuade them to help him find and stop Raven. Before he goes, he gets instructions from the older men on how to deal with their younger selves, who, like a lot of younger selves, can be jerks. From the point that Wolverine opens his eyes and finds himself staring at a lava lamp, X-Men: Days of Future Past is on solid ground. One could quibble about the efficacy of arriving in 1973 to prevent a 1973 event. Wouldn't it be easier to nip things in the bud a few years earlier? But in movies, characters always land at the point in the past that provides the most drama, not the easiest solution. A character out to kill Hitler, for example, would never show up at his crib, but at a Nuremberg rally.  For years now, X-Men movies have pushed the idea that the mutants serve no intrinsic threat to humanity and that peaceful coexistence is possible. But this notion has always seemed purely fanciful until now. In Days of Future Past, the 1973 assassination is not just a catalytic event - like, say, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 - but a moral pivot point. And the young Charles Xavier, played by James McAvoy, embodies the possibility of a moral, peaceful path.The importance of McAvoy can't be overestimated. Charles' particular gift is that he can read everyone's thoughts, and in this early stage of his abilities, he can't filter them out. It's as though he were walking through a field of competing radio signals. McAvoy conveys the torment of this - how it might as easily break him as make him. At the same time, McAvoy lets us know, without ever stating it, Charles Xavier's privileged grasp of the living world, and its inevitable consequence, which is empathy. If he could only instill that vision in others, there might really be peace. As the young Magneto, Michael Fassbender is more of a hard guy, and much of the movie involves Wolverine's effort to corral the competing interests and impulses of the various mutant factions before they destroy themselves. As the impetuous Raven, Jennifer Lawrence goes through the film in a blue, form-fitting second skin that leaves little to imagine, except how flexible the MPAA can be when assessing major summer releases. The role itself is something of a cheat - Raven can take the form of anyone, which means she is the ultimate version of the hoary action movie device, where someone takes off a rubber mask and is revealed to be someone else.  At times, X-Men: Days of Future Past goes in directions that are far-fetched and unlikely, even within its own exaggerated world. But for the most part, it entertains. The 1973 art direction is impeccable - not just the cars, but the storefronts and the fonts in the signage - and even the songs on the soundtrack are from that particular year.  Most important, there is an emotional undercurrent in this installment that the earlier films only aspired to. When for a brief moment, the younger Charles Xavier meets the older, there is the sense of time's mystery - and also of the long, magnificent slog of a purpose-driven life. To his credit, even in his younger incarnation, Charles is too serious a man to exclaim, Oh, no! I went bald? or even to ask how old he was when it happened. I know my younger self would not have had such restraint. ",1

One of the best of the “X-Men” films, the new entry is full of finely crafted action, all of it in the service of interesting and well-thought-out ideas. Resting on neither formula nor audience goodwill, the “X-Men” series is going deeper and getting better as it goes along. The first title card — 3600 B.C.E. — brings a mild feeling of oh-no-must-we-go-there, but this evaporates virtually from the first shot, as we realize that director Bryan Singer intends to do this for real. For a little pre-credits sequence, he re-creates ancient Egypt — not just a little room somewhere in Egypt. He shows us a parade, where we can see the opulence of the era, and the pyramids when they were new, and the faces of the slaves. The idea at work here is that the Egyptian rulers were actually the first mutants, and that the top ruler — known as Apocalypse, so you know he’s not nice — had the ultimate power. By inhabiting the bodies of a series of mutants, he has maintained his youth and acquired multiple abilities. But then there’s a mishap, and Apocalypse is rendered unconscious, which is a very good thing for the course of civilization.Singer illustrates the passage of time from ancient days through the late 20th century by catapulting the viewer through a twisting corridor, in which we see glimpses of the crucifixion, Renaissance art, the rise of Nazism and the emergence of the Cold War. Finally, we arrive in the promising era of the 1980s. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has all his hair, as well as a school for mutants. And Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is living happily and anonymously, as a family man and factory worker in Poland.So everything is going along swimmingly ... and then Apocalypse wakes up.Every action movie needs a villain, but not just any old villain with a vague desire to take over the world, or cause destruction, or take revenge. A villain needs a rationale, a philosophy, a highly developed conviction that he’s right, as well some twisted logic that lets us understand how he’s thinking. He also needs some personal magnetism, so that we can understand why others might follow him. Through the script and through Oscar Isaac’s performance, we get that in Apocalypse.Apocalypse has an idea, which was something like Hitler’s idea, that the strong should dominate. So when he puts on his hood and steps out of his cave, he is repulsed. Instead of a world in which the strong are in control, he sees systems in place that protect the weak. To his eyes, the weak are dominating the strong, to him the ultimate perversity. So he has only one logical course, to figure out a way to destroy absolutely everything and start all over.Apocalypse recruits mutants, but they’re best left to be discovered. It’s how Apocalypse does it that’s worth noting. He tells the mutants he chooses that he wants to make them stronger, and then he does. In the case of Psylocke, a quasi-dominatrix mutant played by Olivia Munn, he tells her, “Unlike others who seek to control you, I seek to set you free.” He’s going to make her great again, and it’s a beautiful thing.As in “Captain America: Civil War,” we soon have two teams of individuals, each with what could be called super powers, fighting each other. But “Civil War” gave us a weak situation in which no one was wrong, little was at stake and the consequences were mild. “X-Men: Apocalypse,” by contrast, goes for broke. Civilization is at stake, and both sides are trying to kill each other.In most superhero movies, trying to kill each other would mean scenes of characters throwing each other around. But “X-Men: Apocalypse” is smarter than that, with the most important battles taking place inside the minds of Apocalypse and Charles Xavier. Xavier’s mental capacity to communicate with everyone on the planet seems almost like a metaphor for the Internet here. To succeed, tyrants need that final piece, complete control over communications.Jennifer Lawrence is such a strong presence that it’s only when the movie is over that one realizes that her character, Mystique, serves a secondary function here. The movie’s focus is mainly fixed on Charles and Magneto and the evolution of their worldview. Their stories echo and reverberate. They seem to mean more than what’s simply on the surface. They are the best argument for “X-Men: Apocalypse” as a thinking person’s action movie. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic.

"Jessica Chastain’s career so far has been a mix of mild successes and flat-out triumphs, but her performance in “Miss Sloane” stands as a particular highlight. The film calls for Chastain to enter into her fierce, hard-charging, single-minded mode, an aspect of her screen persona that we’ve seen recently in some of her supporting roles (“Crimson Peak,” “A Most Violent Year”). Here we get it full blast, in a movie in which her character is the star or subject of every scene.She plays a Washington lobbyist in “Miss Sloane,” a workaholic who barely sleeps and eats only out of necessity, a strategic thinker who is always two or three moves ahead of her competitors. She is ruthless and secretive, ready to do anything to win. And she is rather amoral, but not completely. There are lines she won’t cross and lines she will, and, for the audience, trying to figure out which lines are which is part of the fun. It must be said: There is just something satisfying in watching an actress tear into a role like this. It’s like a lioness chomping on a zebra. In “Miss Sloane,” Chastain’s lipstick is the color of fresh blood, and her skin is as pale as a vampire’s. Sometimes she’s hard, sometimes she’s soft, but she is always focused, in a performance that’s more than a portrayal of female strength. It’s a demonstration of it.  She’s great. The movie is merely good. Still, good is good, especially when it provides this kind of showcase. Miss Sloane (Chastain) is the leading talent in a lobbying firm that seems to have no fixed principles, though its ideology leans toward the conservative. In an early scene, a senator comes to her with a proposition. He wants her to work on a campaign to turn women against gun control. He gives her his reasoning, and she listens patiently, then laughs in his face. So that’s one moral line she won’t cross. The story shakes down as a contest over some impending legislation surrounding the gun issue. A bill imposing mandatory wait times is about to go to the Senate, and two lobbying firms are doing battle to sway senators to their side. Miss Sloane, switching teams, leads the pro-gun-control forces, while her old firm — led by Sam Waterston at his coldest and Michael Stuhlbarg at his sleaziest — advocates for the gun lobby.  Two assumptions are implicit in Jonathan Perera’s script, so understood by everyone in this world that they never need to be stated. The first is that whichever side has the most money is almost always going to win. And the second is that senators aren’t senators for the sake of doing anything. They’re senators for the sake of keeping their jobs as senators. There’s not a principled politician in the entire film, and if this is anything like a real portrait of Washington life, things are even sadder than you think. Perera is a first-time screenwriter, and director John Madden (“Shakespeare in Love”) does his best to paper over weaknesses in the script. For example, though the movie is profoundly cynical about politics, there’s a weird naivete in its presentation of personal relationships. In one instance, Miss Sloane develops a cordial connection with one of her staffers (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) — a young woman who survived a high school massacre in the 1990s. There’s only the most casual kind of closeness between them, but the movie leans heavily on that relationship, assuming emotional depths that aren’t there, and assuming we care more than we do.  Also, despite the evocative brilliance of Chastain’s portrait, Miss Sloane remains a rather shadowy figure. We want to know more about her — not more details or history, necessarily, but more insight, more sides to her. With some movies, you get the feeling that the screenwriter told you all he knows, and he only knew just enough to get by. “Miss Sloane” gives you a little bit of that feeling. All the same, “Miss Sloane” is one of the year’s handful of great actress vehicles, and Chastain takes this role by the throat, smashes it against the wall about 10 times and then devours it while it’s still quivering. You want to see star acting on a grand scale? “Miss Sloane” is the movie to see.  Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic. Email: mlasalle.com Twitter:  Miss Sloane Drama.

Sci-fi action. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. Directed by Rian Johnson. (R. 118 minutes.) Looper, from writer-director Rian Johnson, gets at an essential truth, and yet gently, almost as if in passing. On the surface an unusually smart science-fiction thriller, the movie is a meditation on the soul in the face of technology - about how major scientific breakthroughs challenge our conception of life and make us rethink our understanding of what it means to be human.  The year is 2044, a time of flying motorcycles and retro 20th century fashion. Time travel does not yet exist, but in 2044 some people already know it will exist just a generation down the line. Among those in the know is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who is a paid killer, but a very particular kind. In the 2070s, mob bosses send the people they want eliminated back to 2044, where guys like Joe kill them and dispose of the bodies.  Yes, it's murder, but technology muddies the moral waters. Joe is killing people, but he's really killing future entities, people who exist on another plane. Anyone, for example, alive in Joe's world who is killed by Joe still has another 30 years to go as of 2044. Knowing this removes some of the stigma of being a killer, not only in his eyes but in those of the audience. Visually, the world of 2044 is rendered subtly. Cell phones are transparent, but cars look similar, and skylines haven't completely transformed. Thirty-two years is a long time, but not that long. As Joe, Gordon-Levitt looks like a young man of today, but exaggerated, a cartoon version. He seems to be wearing makeup and eyeliner, and his hair is too perfect. He has a gruff manner of speaking, but slightly artificial, like someone who has watched too many 20th century crime movies. It's very thought out: We recognize both a familiar type and the skewed consciousness of a future man. Joe works for a crime boss, played by Jeff Daniels, who has come from the 2070s to run his mob's killing service in 2044. Daniels is in only a couple of scenes, but he nails them - you just have to look at Daniels' cynical aspect to know that whatever is happening in the 2070s will be no improvement over the 2040s. At one point, Joe tells him of his plan to move to France, and he answers that he should go to China instead. I'm from the future, he says in a tired way. Go to China. Most of Looper concerns a new twist in the lives of the paid assassins. Apparently in the 2070s, in an effort to tie up loose ends, the guys who were assassins in the 2040s are being rounded up and sent back to 2044 to be killed. And so it happens that Joe finds himself in a situation in which he is supposed to kill his older self, played by Bruce Willis.  It's a measure of the finesse of Rian Johnson's storytelling that talking about Looper can sound much more confusing than the actual experience of it. For the rest of the film, Young Joe and Old Joe inhabit the same world, sometimes on the same side, sometimes in opposition. Their interests are different. Young Joe just wants to live his life. Old Joe wants to correct things in the past to alter the future. Interestingly, at no point does Young Joe look at Old Joe and lament his certain future as a bald guy. There are bigger concerns here. Johnson doesn't explain too much, but he explains just enough about how two people can be one person, and how the younger entity's actions, in real time, can affect the memory of the older entity. The casting is carefully considered, as well, from Willis, whose Old Joe is even more dangerous than Young Joe, to Emily Blunt, who goes American this time and plays a young mother with a winning warmth and vulnerability. Also worth noting is young Pierce Gagnon, as a little boy who might very well grow up to be a monster in the 2070s. Gagnon has all the sweetness of a pint-size Edward G. Robinson, and from some angles looks like a 45-year-old in a child's body. ",1
"Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Scarlett Johansson in Don Jon, in an undated handout image. On Sept. 27 Gordon-Levitt enters the ranks of first-time film directors with Don Jon, an edgy romantic comedy he stars in and also wrote. (Daniel McFadden/Relativity Media via The New York Times)Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Scarlett Johansson in Don Jon, in an undated handout image. On Sept. 27 Gordon-Levitt enters the ranks of first-time film directors with Don Jon, an edgy romantic comedy he stars in Comedy. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore and Tony Danza. Directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (R. 90 minutes.) In his feature debut as a writer-director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt has made a movie about pornography and masturbation. There is more to Don Jon that that. It's daring, has a feeling for its working-class milieu and shows an original comic sensibility. But that exploration - into the function of pornography in the life of one young man, who probably isn't unique - is 90 percent of the movie's inspiration and purpose. That's how the movie begins, with Jon (Gordon-Levitt), in voiceover, talking about how he can get aroused just from the sound of his computer turning on. Porn is one of the pillars of his life. He loves it, and masturbation is his favorite form of sex. You might expect, hearing this, that it's his only form of sex, but as we soon see, he's something of a ladies' man. He picks up good-looking women regularly and brings them home for a one-night stand. His friends call him the Don.  Yet you can see that something is a bit off about the Don, when he has to slip out of bed, after having sex with an attractive woman, in order to go masturbate over porn. What are we to make of this? Is this a harmless predilection, a genuine distortion of the natural impulse, or some kind of abnormal new normal. Keep in mind, for a young man, the Internet has always been there. Technology has been like a second parent. Don Jon isn't an issue movie, or rather it doesn't feel like one. It's a story about a particular guy in a particular place. Jon is Italian American and lives in New Jersey; and although the accents are more like New York and the cultural influences (close family, the Catholic Church) are more nostalgic than contemporary, Gordon-Levitt knows what to exaggerate to comic effect. Tony Danza, as Jon's father, whose temper is always on a hair trigger and who only wants to watch the football game, is particularly dead-on and very funny. Jon and his two buddies go out every weekend, rating on a 1-to-10 scale - Jon won't go with anyone below an 8 - and one day he spots a 10 standing by the bar, in the form of Barbara, played by Scarlett Johansson. Don Jon is an excellent showcase for Johansson. It presents her at her most alluring and provides her with a character with lots of nuance and authority - there's no point in using Johansson in a movie if she's just going to be nice to everybody. Best of all, she gets to play an East Coast type, getting not just the dialect right but the whole attitude and atmosphere.  Most of the picture deals with Jon and Barbara's relationship (with porn always hovering in the background). Barbara's last name is Sugarman, and their interaction is very much working-class Italian meets middle-class Jewish; and yet, curiously, the movie shies from an explicit acknowledgment of that. In fact, at one point, when Jon is asked whether Barbara is Jewish, he says he doesn't know. It's a peculiarity with no apparent explanation. Don Jon deserves praise for wearing its message lightly and yet for daring to present such a lecture in today's Internet-drenched environment. Gordon-Levitt may be blithe in discussing pornography, but his movie nonetheless asserts that porn is addictive and destructive, that it intrudes on intimacy, and that it short-circuits the capacities for interaction and also, ultimately, for pleasure. That's a serious subject and a committed viewpoint, handled with wit and intelligence. Julianne Moore has a nice role as a free spirit, who says any outrageous thing that pops into her head. Moore is fun, turbulent and full of feeling - everything you might expect from her. But the movie, in its last 15 minutes, loses something, or perhaps just fails to gain something. Gordon-Levitt can't quite end his film convincingly. He can only stop it, and so there's little sense of arrival.  Yet if that's the worst that can be said for Don Jon, that's not so bad. At least Gordon-Levitt gets it done in 90 minutes, instead of belaboring a false finish for another half hour.",1
"Journey to the Center of the Earth: Action. Starring Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem. Directed by Eric Brevig. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.)Living at a time when any spectacle imaginable can be put onscreen, action filmmakers have only their good taste to restrain them. It's so easy to dream up monsters and so hard to devise stories and characters. Add into the equation an audience that will flock to whatever makes the biggest noise - not to mention a critical community that often seems willing to lobotomize itself so as to get into the spirit - and it becomes a wonder that anything as satisfying and sensible as Journey to the Center of the Earth ever gets made.No, it's not some earnest dud. Journey is a legit action movie with action sequences, imaginative action set pieces and even one or two monsters. It has the wonderful gimmick of 3-D - still a gimmick after 50 years and still lots of fun - and it has some genuinely harrowing moments, in which you may find yourself worrying about the characters and feeling almost as though you're sharing their adventures. Journey has the old-fashioned virtue of inciting things like fear and empathy (or pity and terror). That's what it has. What it doesn't have are bad computer graphics or any scenes involving superheroes battling it out on a congested New York street. It has no scenes of people getting out of their cars to see what the commotion is, only to go bug-eyed at the sight of two muscle-bound men fighting it out in the sky. Instead, it has characters that are idiosyncratic enough to seem true, with lives that are detailed enough so that the character development isn't perfunctory, but essential to how the story unfolds.Starting out with classic material helps. Journey to the Center of the Earth is a loose adaptation of the Jules Verne novel, set in modern times and featuring a professor (Brendan Fraser) who is thoroughly familiar with Verne's story. The professor, goofy but capable, is locked into a bland existence, teaching small classes and trying to pass along the scientific ideas of his older brother, who went missing 10 years ago. The brother, a committed Vernean, believed that Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth was not a work of fiction, but rather a thinly veiled proclamation of scientific discovery.One day, when seismic patterns are most propitious, the professor sets out for Iceland with his teenage nephew (Josh Hutcherson). To get to a sensor to the top of a mountain, he hires a guide, played by Icelandic actress Anita Briem. But no sooner do they arrive at their destination than a thunderstorm precipitates an avalanche, and they become trapped in a cave. This is where the leisurely buildup pays off. By the time the professor, the nephew and the guide are trapped by 30 tons of rock, their fate is not a matter of indifference to the audience. It no doubt helps that the professor and the guide are not the usual action-movie types. Fraser is eccentric enough never to be typical, and the guide is not the usual annoyingly spunky (or spunkily annoying) American heroine. The screenplay doesn't degenerate into nonstop wisecracks. The filmmakers, confident enough to trust that the story is interesting, stay focused on the central predicament: three characters, stuck underground. Considering that the movie is called Journey to the Center of the Earth, it should come as no surprise that every time the three try to make their way to the surface, they end up going deeper and deeper toward ... the center of the earth. This means various adventures, not to be spelled out here, but also some fantastic sets and, in a lovely touch that's reprised throughout, luminescent birds. Elements that would have been fun in two dimensions take on an extra kick in 3-D. Indeed, director Eric Brevig could have leaned on the 3-D and the action sequences - he could have indulged himself and bloated his movie by 20 minutes - and still had something that would have pleased most viewers. Instead, he told the story. When the story meant a terrific sequence involving someone jumping across an abyss, from one magnetic (floating) rock to another, he provided it. When it didn't, he didn't try to fit one in.This is Brevig's first feature film. Before that, he served as a visual effects supervisor or second unit director on a number of well-known movies. His restraint is admirable in a visual effects man, but maybe that's not as rare as we might expect. Journey shows that Brevig knows exactly what visual effects can do - and more important, what they can't.-- Advisory: Danger and adventure, but otherwise fairly wholesome family entertainment.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Joyeux Noel: Drama. Starring Benno Fürmann, Diane Kruger, Guillaume Canet and Daniel Bruhl. Directed by Christian Carion. (R. 116 minutes. In French and German with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) Written and directed by Christian Carion (The Girl From Paris), the movie -- a best foreign film Oscar nominee from France -- re-creates a unique incident that took place on the front lines on Christmas Eve and Christmas 1914. In this first year of the war, German, British, French and Belgian troops, who had been slaughtering each other for months, initiated a spontaneous and unsanctioned armistice. They put down their guns, sang songs with each other, played soccer, shared rations and posed for photos. They had joint religious services and helped each other bury their dead. Mixing fictional characters with historical fact, Joyeux Noel depicts in a moving way this event, its lead-up and its aftermath. The film calls upon many different talents from its director. It is, first of all, a war movie. Carion must make the war real, which he does, but he also clarifies the conditions in which the men fought, in a way that's rare. For example, we see, once the smoke clears, that the opposing trenches are no more than 100 feet from each other, perhaps closer. With this proximity, it seems inconceivable that any of these combatants could have lasted the duration of the war, which was destined to go on for another 47 months. Further, by not limiting himself to one's side perspective, by striving to tell the whole story, Carion makes it necessary to introduce an unusual number of characters, German, French and British. Once he introduces them, he must juggle their stories, keep track of them and make sure that they continue to move forward and hold interest. He does this in a way that seems effortless but couldn't possibly have been easy, and yet his achievement isn't limited to that alone. Like an expert sketch artist, he brings forth the essence and meaning of his characters' lives, through telling little moments that linger in memory. All the main characters, and some minor ones, are rendered in specific terms -- the German operatic tenor turned soldier (Benno Fürmann), his artistic partner and wife (Diane Kruger), the French lieutenant who won't leave his men for a cushy leadership position (Guillaume Canet), the small-town Scottish chaplain (Gary Lewis) and others. But perhaps the most fascinating and enigmatic of Carion's creations is that of a young German Jewish lieutenant, played by Daniel Bruhl. Bruhl plays a kind of fellow we've all seen before -- no-nonsense, impatient with weakness, a bit caustic and a natural leader, but also honest and with a core of sadness and human feeling. Bruhl never leans on that sensitivity, never really plays it, but somehow he shows it. That the captain is Jewish and destined for further horrors at the hands of his government, a generation hence, is something the audience can never quite forget, and it's something that Carion subtly reminds us of. At one point, the captain rides in a boxcar toward the Russian front, prefiguring the eastern transport of Jews in boxcars 30 years later. World War I produced astonishing casualty rates: 36 percent for the British, 65 percent for the Germans, 73 percent for the French and 90 percent for the Austro-Hungarians. Getting sent to the front was practically a death sentence. Joyeux Noel, arriving nearly a century after hostilities began, reminds us of the vitality stolen from the world by that conflict. -- Advisory: Violence, sexual situations. ",1
"Just as children of all backgrounds can get along because they have something profound in common -- being children -- Man on the Train features two men at a stage in life that dwarfs every other consideration: They're getting older and sense that they've reached the end of the line. Twenty years earlier they might have looked upon each other as odd, unsavory or ridiculous, but now they recognize in each other an aspect of life they wish they might have known. Milan (Johnny Hallyday) is an aging crook who gets off a train in a small French city, where he plans to pull a bank job. The first thing he does is go to a pharmacy -- aging fellows have their complaints -- and there he meets Manesquier (Jean Rochefort), a former poetry teacher who talks nonstop and offers to put him up in his dilapidated old mansion. Rochefort and Hallyday (a singer known as the French Elvis) are icons in their country, and in France their pairing is regarded as being as improbable and momentous as would be the pairing, say, of Dustin Hoffman and Clint Eastwood in a Hollywood film. Americans don't have the same associations with these actors, and yet the magic is unmistakable: In the stone-faced, gruff- voiced Hallyday and the fluttery, melancholic Rochefort we see two poles of manhood and are made to appreciate and value both. . This film contains strong language and brief violence. -- Mick LaSalle Romance. Starring Valerie Lemercier, Vincent Lindon. Directed by Claire Denis. Written by Denis and Emmanuele Bernheim. (Not rated. In French with English subtitles. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere). . Friday Night, the intimate, captivating new film by French director Claire Denis (Beau Travail), explores the ways people will use any break in routine as a means of liberation. In Friday Night, it's a traffic jam that leads a young woman to an affair, but it could have been anything. Inspired by the 1995 Paris transit strike that sent people to their cars and choked city streets, Friday Night captures the microcosmic reality of a vehicle's interior, which can offer a comforting, if illusory, sense of well- being. This holds especially true for a young motorist (Valerie Lemercier) whose life is in transit, the contents of her apartment having been packed into boxes for a move to her boyfriend's house. Directors talk of how hard it is to shoot inside a car, but Denis uses a battered Peugeot to create a worldview defined by its confines, muffled horns and smudged city lights providing a backdrop for the sweaty drama of making a right turn from a middle lane -- the biggest event of the day. The mood of this traffic snarl quickly switches from resignation to tension, only some of it due to road rage. Bored and curious, the driver lets a handsome pedestrian (Vincent Lindon) into her car. Their opening exchanges are so terse that it's a relief when the guy lights a cigarette, the plumes of smoke, exaggerated by Denis' camera, filling the silence. Even during long moments without dialogue, we never tire of watching these actors' finely calibrated performances. Lemercier and Lindon have impassive yet compelling faces, as if each holds a secret. But careful reserve falls away with the couple's first, impassioned embrace -- of each other, and of the inevitable nature of the evening. Lemercier, especially, lights up once her character decides to dive in. What are you thinking about . . . me? the woman asks, indulging herself with this stranger in a way, Lemercier suggests, that she cannot with her steady beau. Denis hasn't offered much about the woman's past, but enough to know that she's weighed down by those moving boxes, by the boyfriend's expectations and by her married friends' silent disapproval of her single status. In a humorous, Seinfeld-esque moment, the woman calls ahead to a friend at whose home she's supposed to dine. The pal, squalling baby on hip, tells her the strike has kept others from the dinner party but that she should still come over, to see the baby. Let's see . . . crying baby or hot stranger in the car? Tough choice. . This film contains strong sexual content, nudity. -- Carla Meyer Drama. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Don Cheadle and Zooey Deschanel. Directed by Jordan Melamed. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Manic, a drama about teenagers in a mental institution, is buoyed by some sensitive performances and nearly tanked by insensitive filming. The actors do their best, while the camera shakes into focus around their eyes and their noses, homes in on facial blemishes and, when anything resembling action starts, goes into a fractured, unfocused tizzy. One word: tripod. It might have helped. The cinematography in Manic is a handheld mistake, the latest in bad photography. That's too bad because get past that indie-film cliche and one discovers a movie of heart and substance. Most of Manic takes place in the institution, where kids with various problems spend the day taking medication, hanging around and partaking in group therapy sessions with their doctor. Group therapy is where the kids reveal themselves, and it's a virtue of Michael Bacall and Blayne Weaver's screenplay that it takes no shortcuts in this area. The teenagers are guarded and, when they do talk, they are either phenomenally inarticulate or reveal heads stuffed with nonsense -- ridiculous misconceptions, vague but passionate grievances and silly pop-culture obsessions. We get to know them, but in the right way (and the hard way) -- by reading between the lines. The film follows Lyle, a boy with a penchant for flying into rages and beating people up, maybe because his father beat him up, or maybe because anger is in the genes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is appropriately sullen, but he doesn't exactly seem tough. It's Zooey Deschanel who steals the movie as the terrified, insecure Tracy, staring out at the world with eyes as big as headlamps. As the doctor who has to treat the kids, Don Cheadle brings a weariness and intensity to his role. The intensity comes from caring and knowing the consequences of failure. The weariness comes from talking to teenagers all day and trying to get through to them. He gets paid to bang his head against the wall. Sooner or later, one or the other is bound to crack. . This film contains violence, sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle . Feats of endurance figure in Matthew Barney's performance work and in his five-part screen epic, The Cremaster Cycle. In Cremaster 3, the most recent installment, despite its number, we see Barney scale the spiral tiers of New York's Guggenheim Museum, hoisting himself up along plastic panels hooked over the balusters. But viewers of Barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it. The word cremaster names a muscle that governs the impalpable rise and descent of a man's testicles. Its use as a title forewarns audiences of Barney's peculiar mix of sexual morbidity, inarticulate emotion, fetishistic paralysis and squandered athleticism. If Busby Berkeley had ever had a bad acid trip, it might have resembled Cremaster 1 (1995), with its prolonged aerial views of dance formations on the blue Astroturf of an Idaho stadium. Some of Barney's images are dazzling in their strangeness and sleek finish. But he often seems to labor under the delusion that he is David Cronenberg. Cronenberg always accounts for the bizarreness of his images within his work. The portentous goings-on in Barney's videos-converted-to-film require elaborate explanations, none of which has yet provided much clarity. Things happen with excruciating slowness in Barney's epics. Even when events, such as the motorcycle race around the Isle of Man in Cremaster 4 (1994), involve speed, Barney finds tortuous ways to defer their intelligibility. Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector has made admirable but unavailing stabs at summarizing the action in Barney's Cremaster Cycle. Myth and machine combine to narrate a story of candidacy, which involves a trial of the will, Spector writes. The film comprises three main character zones. The Loughton Candidate (played by Barney) is a satyr with two sets of impacted sockets in his head. . . . The second and third character zones comprise a pair of motorcycle sidecar teams: the Ascending and Descending Hacks. A trio of attendant fairies mirrors the three narrative fields occupied by the Candidate and the two racing teams. . . . As the bikes vie for the title, gelatinous gonadal forms -- undifferentiated sex organs -- emerge from slots in the riders' uniforms in a migratory quest for directionality. Cremaster 2 (1999) turns obscurely on the family lore that executed Utah murderer Gary Gilmore may have been a descendant of Harry Houdini, while Cremaster 3 (2002) re-dreams the making of Manhattan's Chrysler Building as an allegory of moral catastrophe symbolized by flubbed Masonic rites. Anyone who plans to visit Barney's exhibition at the Guggenheim in New York (it ends June 11) may find The Cremaster Cycle instructive preparation. Most of the sculpture on view there has appeared in the cycle, episodes of which are screened throughout the museum, including the passages shot there. The signature quality of Barney's work -- lovelessness -- finally becomes clear in the Guggenheim show, but it subtly, sometimes subliminally, poisons every moment of The Cremaster Cycle. -- Kenneth Baker The Trip opens with a shot of the lonesome highway, a police car and a scorpion on the parched desert. It takes a long, long time to get back to any of them, and by that time we've lost interest. This is apparently meant to build up to a rousing, break-the-rules conclusion, as in Thelma and Louise. But you have never seen so many people so slow on the uptake in all your life. It is never a good sign when the audience is two steps ahead of the characters on the screen. Waiting for them to catch up wears everyone out. The concept is that a sexually confused, uptight Republican, Alan (Larry Sullivan), meets a hunky, out-front gay activist, Tommy (Steve Braun). Alan begins to question his sexual identity, but everyone can see where this is headed a good half an hour before Alan gets the drift. The worst part is that everyone is a stereotype. Not just the repressed, inflexible straights but the zany, randy gays. There's the drama queen pal, the homophobic girlfriend and, of course, Alan's rigid, clueless dad is an ex- Marine. Time passes, from bell-bottom '70s to clean-cut '80s, but the jokes never improve. Tommy asks Alan's ditzy girlfriend if they are planning a menage a trois. Oh no, she says, Alan hates French food. Keep an eye out for Jill St. John looking for a little exposure as Alan's mother. Her best hope is that this becomes a camp classic. -- C.W. Nevius ",1
"Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in Friends With Benefits.Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in Friends With Benefits.Romantic comedy. Starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Directed by Will Gluck. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Over the last 45 years, we have seen a gradual breakdown in traditional morality, in all those time-honored rules regarding love and sex. At the same time, the demands of romantic comedy have remained the same - to affirm love, to make it fun and to keep audiences believing. So what do you do if you want to make a romantic comedy today? One way, the wrong way, is to deny the obvious and gloss over the truth, to rely on convention and skate on the charm of two stars. That, fortunately, is exactly what Friends With Benefits does not do. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have charm to spare, but the movie doesn't abuse its assets. Instead, it gives them an honest story to work with, one that acknowledges that the challenge facing single adults is the same as the challenge facing romantic comedy - to arrive at love in a world without rules. In a jungle.  So she's a corporate headhunter. He's a Los Angeles transplant who has come to New York for a major job at Gentleman's Quarterly. And they meet professionally and like each other. But they're afraid that a romantic involvement would ruin their burgeoning friendship, and so they decide to have sex and keep emotion out of it. The setup sounds something like No Strings Attached, an Ashton Kutcher-Natalie Portman movie from earlier this year, but Friends With Benefits takes things beyond the sex gimmick.  In fact, this film's harshness and starkness will strike some people as vulgar, but if you reject it on that basis you might as well just reject the times you're living in. Accordingly, the first sex scene strikes all the right notes. It's coarse, amoral and so mechanical as to make you wonder about these people. Yet, if you pay attention, you will detect in their offhand rapport and mutual amusement the foundation of a real connection.  Not all that long ago in the history of courtship, sexual intercourse was the last frontier of intimacy. Our grandparents didn't arrive there too often in their dating lives, but when they did, they knew where they were. But in Friends With Benefits, sex can mean anything, and every spoken intimacy might be a ruse, or the product of a passing mood. The starkness of the first sex scene is later beautifully contrasted with a moment in which the two just kiss, and we understand the genuine intimacy of the exchange. MTV has an annual award for best kiss. This is an early front-runner. Of course, as this is a romantic comedy, we know from the beginning who belongs together. But for once a romantic comedy gives its characters the dignity of knowing things we don't know. They are adults and therefore scarred and have every reason to avoid pain. The richness of the characters allows the story to develop in true and nuanced ways. The takeaway on Friends With Benefits is that mores change, styles change, the rules change, and even humor changes. (There are two jokes involving apps, of all things, that are pretty funny.) But people's emotional needs remain the same from era to era. Between the lines, there's another suggestion, a gutsy one that another movie might have tried to deny in some faux feminist gesture: The kind of cold-blooded situation depicted here - in which people try to have sex without emotion - might not be good for anybody, but it favors male nature. In most cases, it's probably worse for the woman. As comic actors, Kunis is giving, full of invention and emotionally present, and Timberlake is crisp, precise and a trifle cool. They make us believe they would be good for each other, and they are. The two find able support in Patricia Clarkson as her free-spirited mother and Richard Jenkins as his journalist father.  But, of course, the ultimate support is a smart script. In Friends With Benefits, when the two argue, and one is wrong, the point of view of the one who's wrong is just as well argued as the one who's right. That kind of thing is frustrating in life, because it happens so often, but it's welcome in movies because it's so rare.",1
"Kathy Bates and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Directed by Taylor Hackford. (R. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In fact it's a slightly overcooked mystery that manages to cram a host of fashionable hot-button topics -- including euthanasia, drug and alcohol dependency and repressed memory syndrome -- into a little more than two hours. The mysteries of Dolores Claiborne are never gripping enough to consume an audience, and there are few, if any, surprises along the way. But the women are wonderful and reason enough to see the picture. As directed by Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman), Dolores Claiborne, which opens today, has a moody, contemplative atmosphere, a seriousness sometimes out of proportion to the material. But by steering away from opportunities for macabre humor, Hackford provides an environment in which Bates and Leigh can genuinely inhabit the film's bizarre mother-daughter situation. Bates plays the title role, a woman who was almost prosecuted 20 years before for killing her husband (he fell down a well under questionable circumstances). Now all these years later Dolores is being investigated for yet another murder -- that of her employer, who either fell down the stairs on her own or was pushed by Dolores. Leigh plays Dolores' daughter, Selena, a hotshot writer for Esquire. Like another hotshot magazine writer of an earlier era,  Dorothy Parker, Selena has some substance-abuse issues she needs to sort out: She smokes constantly, guzzles scotch like water and won't go anywhere without a handbag full of mood- altering pills. That's just how some sensitive individuals deal with the likelihood that Mom murdered Dad. Although both Bates' and Leigh's names appear above the title, this is mostly a Kathy Bates movie. About a third takes place in flashback, showing in bits and pieces the family picture, circa 1975, and the events leading up to Dad's dropping into the well. Selena is in these scenes, too, but as a child (Ellen Muth). David Strathairn, usually typed as a well-meaning stoic, is a nightmare in these flashbacks as Dolores' late husband -- an evil, grungy, drunken slob. In one scene he picks up a block of wood out of nowhere and whacks Dolores on the back with it. Why do you make me do that? he asks her. Throughout, Bates is fascinating, first as a terrified and repressed housewife and later as a woman reveling in her role as the local crank in her tiny Maine village. Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold on to, she says. That line is so good it's reprised twice in the picture, at least one time too many. For most of the way, the role of the adult Selena is one that calls for only a single note -- sullen bitterness -- but Leigh is a marvel even just sitting at a table trying to drink herself into a coma. The wonder of Leigh's act ing, here and in general, is the way her stunning authenticity has only a casual relationship to cold accuracy. What Leigh is doing on screen isn't naturalism. It's something bigger, weirder and, strangely enough, truer. Her first scene finds Selena in her element as the hard-boiled celebrity journalist, trying to persuade her boss (Eric Bogosian) to give her a plum assignment. No one, with the possible exception of Leigh herself, could confuse Leigh's twitchy, highly idiosyncratic impression with the real thing. But then reality is too small to hold all the nuances Leigh brings to these moments. The quietly strained atmosphere of Dolores Claiborne is heightened by the cinematography of Gabriel Beristain (Caravaggio). He outdoes himself in the flashback sequence taking place during a solar eclipse, with the colors of the sky and of the landscape becoming gradually richer as the light dims. ",1
"Katy Perry in KATY PERRY: PART OF ME, from Insurge Pictures.Katy Perry in KATY PERRY: PART OF ME, from Insurge Pictures.Left to right: KatyÕs Grandmother Ann Hudson and Katy Perry in KATY PERRY: PART OF ME, from Insurge Pictures.Left to right: KatyÕs Grandmother Ann Hudson and Katy Perry in KATY PERRY: PART OF ME, from Insurge Pictures. ‌Documentary. Starring Katy Perry. Directed by Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Any self-produced documentary about oneself is bound to be a propaganda film, but Katy Perry: Part of Me is a good one, and a persuasive one. It may even be a true one. Who knows? Certainly, audiences will come away admiring Perry's long struggle for stardom, marveling at the stresses of a concert tour, and liking and maybe even respecting her music.Part of Me is an onstage and backstage look at Perry's 2011 tour, which was worldwide and went on for a year and sounds a lot more glamorous than the workaday reality. On the plus side, this was her life's dream. She had five No. 1 hits off the same album and, at 26, she was making enough money to take her through the next dozen lifetimes in style. On the other hand, it was a matter of give, give, give around the clock, every day, for months on end.We see her at the beginning of the tour, fresh and ready, and by the end, completely exhausted and nerve-shattered, crying for no reason and basically doing an imitation of herself just to get through routine social encounters.Perry became an overnight success with the song I Kissed a Girl, but the documentary shows that years and years of struggle preceded that breakthrough. Her frustration must have been overwhelming: Twice she came within inches of stardom. In the first case, she signed with a hit-making producer, but nothing happened. Then she signed with Columbia, which had no idea what to do with her - but were reluctant to let her go. Perry endured five years of hope, doubt and disappointment, during which she was perceived as damaged goods within the industry. Until she was somebody, she was absolutely nobody. Her friends and employees - some are both - all speak well of her, but it's easy to speak well of your boss on camera, especially in your boss' movie. What does stand out is that Perry, once she did make it, brought along her hairstylist and her clothes designer, who were at the time complete unknowns. She also appears to be on good terms with her parents, who are evangelical preachers, and even with her nasty old grandmother, who doesn't have a nice thing to say about anything, at least not on camera.According to Part of Me, Perry arranged her tour so that she would work two weeks at a time - at one point, she does 18 concerts in a row - with three-day breaks so that she could fly to see her (now ex) husband, Russell Brand. Just thinking about that kind of schedule is tiring. Imagine doing it. Brand himself shows up on the tour only once, or at least only once that we see. So we're left with the impression (which may or may not be true) of a devoted and overworked wife repeatedly flying off to see this rather weird and under-appreciative husband.In between the life details, we get the music and the concert footage, and these scenes are fun, sometimes exhilarating. Personally, I don't gravitate to pop extravaganzas that have dancers and mimes and set choreography, but that seems to be the standard these days. But the songs are good. Perry is not an intellectual, like Lady Gaga. Her songs don't get better the more you hear them. But they address what it's like to be a young person in this decade, and I'm pretty sure that, if I were 16, I'd see Perry as some kind of goddess.As it stands, her music gets under your skin and makes you feel good - and the movie makes you feel good about Katy Perry. ‌ ‌  ‌",1
"Keeping Up With the Steins: Comedy. Starring Garry Marshall, Daryl Sabara, Jami Gertz and Jeremy Piven. Directed by Scott Marshall. (PG-13. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It hardly matters that the tribute is between the lines and has nothing directly to do with the characters. On the surface, Keeping Up With the Steins tells the story about the weeks leading up to a bar mitzvah, in the competitive upper-class enclave of Brentwood. As the shy boy (Daryl Sabara) looks toward the big day, he finds himself in the middle of tensions between his straitlaced dad (Jeremy Piven) and his old hippie grandfather (Garry Marshall), who abandoned his family years ago. One might expect a farce from this setup, with both the father and the grandfather treated with warm condescension. But Marshall, who plays the grandfather, is the father of Scott Marshall, who directed the picture. And gradually, Scott throws the film to Garry, lavishing time on scenes of grandpa offering the grandson guidance and wisdom and showing loving tableaus of the old man and the boy fishing or just walking together. That this becomes effective, and doesn't come across as a director and his father doing a tag-team on someone else's screenplay, can be credited to two things. First, it doesn't seem conscious -- or at least not obvious. The treatment of the grandfather is loving, but dignified. The second is that Garry Marshall is appealing enough to justify tilting a movie in his direction. Indeed, this is the first time that the warmth, charm and self-possession that Marshall displays in interviews have been captured on screen. He's a very engaging guy. Scott Marshall photographs his father in a way that talented, besotted directors sometimes photograph their leading ladies, as if using the camera as the mere excuse to do all the looking that would not be allowed in real life. As always in movies, the goal is to understand the mystery and preserve the surface, but in this case the mystery is a father's offbeat, casual grandeur, and the surface being celebrated isn't fleeting beauty but an aging body. The unalloyed affection with which the director films, in long shot, Marshall's tall, slightly stooped frame -- with a determination to hold this moment and keep it -- takes Keeping Up With the Steins just to the level where we can begin to talk about it seriously. The thing is, the affection that the director lavishes on his father is in complete harmony with a story of family rapprochement. And while Scott Marshall's emphasis on grandpa pushes dad off to the sidelines, the director's sensitivity to father-son issues probably has something to do with the intensity of Piven's performance. Piven plays an adult son's anger at his deadbeat father with a heat and a truth unusual in a comedy. The director is able to keep that and yet bring it into balance with the surrounding merriment. And Jami Gertz, as the mother, is lovely, a grownup version of the Jewish girl all us Italian boys were crazy about in high school. Speaking of Italian and Jewish, it may come as a surprise that Garry Marshall is not Jewish but Italian -- his family is from Abruzzo. And he doesn't try to act Jewish for the role -- that's really him. Marshall just happens to be a Jewish-seeming Italian, a sort of Harvey Keitel in reverse. -- Advisory: A naked old man as seen from behind. You've seen worse. ",1

Starring Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. (R. 150 minutes.) If Robert Zemeckis took a survey of travelers' ultimate nightmares, he couldn't devise a more effective sequence than the plane crash in Flight: The sky is blue, the sun is shining, and all at once, with no warning, the plane loses hydraulics and starts heading, speeding, for the Earth - nose down. Then there's that other nightmare, which also finds its way into the sequence, that of being in a passenger plane that's flying underneath wires and grazing the tops of buildings. It's a strange and powerful thing to see nightmares made visible, and for that reason and others, the plane crash in Flight must go down as one of the strongest single scenes of 2012: It's extended, detailed, technically and emotionally realistic, and beyond that, it reveals character. We believe that Denzel Washington is 7 miles up in the sky, and we believe that the troubled, gifted pilot he's playing is just cold and distanced enough to keep his head. In most ways, Flight is a superior movie, and it deserves to be seen. Zemeckis sets the tone from the first moments, in which a nude woman gets up from Washington's bed, with evidence of the previous night's debauch scattered throughout the room. Within seconds, we learn that the hung-over wreck sticking his head out from the covers is not only an airline captain but one scheduled to pilot a passenger plane in 90 minutes.  The captain, a genius in the air and a drunken mess on the ground, is something of a departure for Washington, but only in the details. In a broad sense, the character has the audacity and the ultimate core integrity that this actor has embodied for most of his career. Despite the dazzling plane crash sequence, not to mention a compelling scene of a plane experiencing horrific turbulence, Flight is really an extended character study about the struggle going on inside one man. It's 150 minutes long, goes by in a shot, and for at least 135 minutes, it's a thoroughly engrossing experience. What keeps the audience glued is the peculiar circumstance that Capt. Whitaker (Washington) finds himself in. He should be the next Sully - his achievement was phenomenal. Yet he was drunk when he was flying the plane (that's probably why he did so well), and so he might easily become the fall guy. Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood play the lawyer and the union representative, respectively, who are determined to clear the captain and keep him out of prison. But this pilot is his own worst enemy. Also in the mix, and an incalculably important addition, is Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a recovering heroin addict who meets Whitaker in the hospital. You might know Reilly from an earlier incarnation, when she played the freckled and cherubic English girl in L'Auberge Espagnole (2002). Time has been kind, and she has morphed into a sleek and slightly damaged beauty, with a distracted, idiosyncratic manner that suggests more than words. Zemeckis deserves praise for casting her. She has been in movies for years, but this is the first time she has ever gotten to bat with the bases loaded. Under Zemeckis' direction, when Reilly and Washington are onscreen, the eyes go to Reilly.  Now for the bad news, saved for last because it hardly deserves pride of place, though it does bring Flight down to earth with a noticeable thud: The last 15 minutes are off. That ending is just not the right ending. No, I don't have a better ending in mind, but the one that's there simply isn't right. It would take too many spoiler alerts to explain why, except to say that screenwriter John Gatins seems to have boxed himself into two unattractive possibilities, and he chose the best of the two. He should have rejected the choice.",1
"Kenneth Branagh’s new adaptation of “Murder on the Orient Express” contains some of the best of old and new. Based on the novel by Agatha Christie, this is in many ways an old-fashioned entertainment, but it has the pace and visual richness of a modern movie. And it’s almost as star-studded as the famous 1974 adaptation, which starred Albert Finney, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman (in an Oscar-winning performance), Lauren Bacall and John Gielgud.Fans of the 1974 version may see this movie and think, “Oh, but the original was so much better.” But to them must go the question, “Yes, but when was the last time you saw that original?” — because this Branagh version makes an honest case for itself, with a flashy opening and an improved ending. Roles are beefed up, tailored to the strengths of particular actors. This is especially true in the case of Michelle Pfeiffer, who has a remarkable scene not found in the 1974 movie.And then there’s Branagh himself as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who enters into a struggle with an elaborate and highly distracting mustache and ultimately emerges victorious. It’s a close call. The mustache is a fascinating work of engineering, extending across most of his face, and for at least the first half hour, it distracts from dialogue at every close-up. But Branagh wins out through charm and a general sense of fun that doesn’t preclude an underlying sadness.The Poirot of Branagh is an oddball — Poirots are often oddballs — but this time he isn’t all that happy about life as an outsider. He explains that he has an obsession with perfection that makes daily life difficult, but that allows him to see imperfections, or clues, that others miss. Exhausted by overwork, he boards a train for the beginning of a vacation, but, alas, when you’re Hercule Poirot, murders have a way of just happening.He’s not on the train for two hours before a businessman named Ratchett tries to hire him as a kind of bodyguard. Johnny Depp plays Ratchett, and for the first time in several years, Depp doesn’t mug. Instead, he subtly exudes spiritual wrongness. He’s polite. He speaks softly, but you just know, something isn’t right with this guy. And if we can tell, so can Poirot, who turns him down flat.Soon, a murder is committed, and by an apparently confident murderer, too, considering that the greatest detective in the world happens to be in the same train car. Poirot takes over the investigation, which allows Branagh to give himself close-ups while saying things like, “There’s a murderer among us!”Though the 1974 film could have been adapted into a stage play, with almost every scene taking place inside the train, Branagh opens things up to good effect. For one thing, the movie begins in Jerusalem, with Poirot solving a case while standing in front of the Wailing Wall. The wintry vistas outside the train are lush and gorgeous, and even when the train derails in the snow, Branagh finds ways to take scenes outside.One might think that a sense of claustrophobia might actually work to the advantage of a murder mystery, but by making his movie beautiful, Branagh serves another purpose. He gives it the glow of the distant past — it’s set in 1934 — and makes everything a little more intense, and slightly unreal.By the way, for fans of the original film who want to know who plays whom, Derek Jacoby has the Sir John Gielgud role; Penelope Cruz is the missionary played by Ingrid Bergman; Josh Gad is the shady secretary originally played by Anthony Perkins (totally different vibe, but equally good); and Judi Dench is the Princess Dragomiroff, originally played by Wendy Hiller.But the most interesting bit of casting is Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline, the divorcee originally played by Lauren Bacall. It’s easy to forget, because she’s so down-to-earth, but Pfeiffer is a great screen actress — not just good, or very good, or interesting, but genuinely great, as in one of the best we have. In writing this adaptation, Michael Green apparently understood this, and gave Pfeiffer a chance to hit one out of the park.One doesn’t expect that kind of intensity in a sedate British murder mystery, but Pfeiffer brings it. On her own, she helps Branagh make the case for his remake over the original. ",1
"Killer of Sheep: Drama. Starring Henry Gayle Sanders and Kaycee Moore. Directed by Charles Burnett. (Not rated. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's a worthy, fascinating film that shows the influence of Bresson and of the Italian neorealists. Filmed on location in the Watts area of Los Angeles, it focuses mainly around Stan (Henry Gayle Sanders), who has a wife and children and supports them by working in a slaughterhouse, killing sheep. The slaughterhouse scenes, which were filmed in a real slaughterhouse in Northern California, are as disturbing as one might imagine. They're meant to be disturbing. The film presents life in a black ghetto in a way that's the antithesis of Spike Lee's approach in Do the Right Thing. Burnett shoots in black and white and eschews drama. There's no riot, no crime story -- in fact, there's very little narrative of any kind. The community is not presented as close. Life is simply difficult. There are extended scenes of kids at play, and they have little to do and little to play with except rotting boards and rocks. Stan is exhausted, depressed and disturbed by his working life and oppressed by the burden of supporting a family. He's a man of intelligence, moral decency and sensitivity who feels utterly trapped. The great value of the film is in the way it captures life in Watts at a certain juncture in the 20th century. But the film is not only about Watts or even about the African American experience. It's about working-class life in the 1970s, and there were moments, seeing Stan sitting in his living room, collapsed into a couch and looking into space, that I flashed back to my own father and the living room of my childhood. Burnett shows us a life in which there's very little to hope for or expect, and he also shows how that hopelessness trickles down even to the small children. It's a powerful film. It's also a film with next to no narrative, not even by the standards of neorealism, and one that's slow, without the compensating mystical grandeur of Bresson's best work. But Burnett has his own virtues. His use of classical compositions and classic blues to underscore scenes give moments an emotional reverberation, and ultimately, there's just no mistaking the film's importance. Likewise, there's no mistaking the contribution of Sanders, whose stern but humane face is the movie's locus of truth. -- Advisory: Strong language and extremely disturbing images. ",1
"Kingdom of Heaven: Action drama. Starring Orlando Bloom, Eva Green and Liam Neeson.Directed by Ridley Scott. (R. 144 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To say that Scott did a beautiful job directing Kingdom of Heaven would be true, but it wouldn't convey the nature of the achievement. A better way to say it is that Scott, in the course of planning and making this huge film, made many thousands of decisions, little and big, and just about all of them turned out right. The scenes of spectacle provide the most flamboyant evidence of the director's sureness and imagination, but they're also evident in the acting moments and in unexpected casting choices, such as that of the young and ultra-modern Eva Green (The Dreamers) as a medieval princess. Unlike Oliver Stone's Alexander, which tried to enlist the audience on Alexander's side by sweeping moral considerations under the rug, Kingdom of Heaven embraces moral complexity. The Christian invaders fight for God and for greed. Some are motivated by faith, and some are just murderous. Balian (Orlando Bloom), the bastard son a knight, finds himself confronted with uncomfortable decisions, in which there are no clear-cut moral choices. Death is the consequence of every course of action. The movie's one consistent point of view is that rationality is to be favored over fanaticism. To kill an infidel is not murder, it's the path to heaven, a priest says, as he greets warriors who'll soon embark for the Middle East. It's the movie's reminder that pious bloodlust is a disease that strikes all sides. They say the door of opportunity opens once for everybody. For Balian, it arrives in the form of an aging knight (Liam Neeson), passing through on the way back to his estate near Jerusalem. Balian, a blacksmith, looks all set to sweat away the rest of his days, banging with a hammer on a molten sword. (Is that all they ever made in those days?) But the knight identifies himself as Balian's long-lost dad and offers to take him to Jerusalem. After a brief delay for decision-making, in which Balian commits a needless murder, he joins Dad's group, which includes a wise and twinkly parson (David Thewlis). For Balian, Jerusalem is an opportunity to remake his life, to be accepted on his merits and live like a prince. Jerusalem is presented as a singular outpost on the edge of the world, rather like the French settlement in Apocalypse Now Redux. The Europeans have imported their customs, and yet the whole thing feels makeshift and temporary, and with this temporary sense comes a loose attitude, such as one might find in a border town. Balian, who has a guilty conscience, feels outside of God's grace, which, ironically, is the key factor in his emergence as a decent man. He aligns himself with Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and the very reasonable but leprosy- ravaged King (Edward Norton), who both want to co-exist with the Arabs. The other faction is represented by a mentally unbalanced lord (Brendan Gleeson) and Guy de Lusignan, the King's brother-in-law and presumed heir (Marton Csokas). Though surrounded on all sides by Arab armies, these two want to attack and slaughter them. Attuned to all shifts in power, they combine a realpolitik unscrupulousness with an utterly delusional faith that God will aid them, no matter what murderous course they undertake. That would seem to be an unlikely combination of traits, except that their type has never ceased turning up in history. The relaxed morals of the Christian outpost make it possible for the blacksmith to soon have carnal knowledge of the politically savvy princess, a case of upward social mobility unheard of in 1186 -- the American dream realized a full 600 years before there even was such a thing. At first Green looks young for the role, but no, she's just right: Royalty must grow up and get wise fast. And she does seem wise, watchful and pragmatic. Kingdom of Heaven is long and sometimes seems long. That, and the fact that occasionally it's difficult to tell who's fighting whom, are about the worst things that can be said for it. Fortunately, all confusion is eliminated for the final sequence, a siege by the Islamic general Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) of Jerusalem's walls. The siege, which goes on for days, is presented in meticulous and absorbing detail, and one comes away from the film with a pretty advanced understanding of medieval military maneuvering. The sky fills with arrows, catapults send fiery rocks crashing into the battlements, and the attacking army struggles to place platforms within range, from which soldiers might scale the walls. The movie shows that the strategies were sophisticated, even if the means were primitive. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, graphic violence and armies getting medieval on each other. ",1
"Kinsey: Drama. Starring Liam Neeson and Laura Linney. Directed by Bill Condon. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The film benefits also from timing. Had Kinsey been made in 1975, it would have seemed worthy but of purely historical interest. But arriving today, in the midst of a culture war and with neo-Puritanism at high tide, Kinsey is suddenly relevant. There's little doubt Kinsey would be pilloried for his findings today, just as he was five decades ago. Thus, whether intentional or not, Kinsey is a timely commentary on a certain anti-science, anti-sex strain in American life. The name Alfred Kinsey is not unknown to people. But what is not adequately appreciated is that before him, there was virtually nothing. Social historians today have a good idea of the progress of sexual mores and behavior as far back as the 1890s, thanks mainly to the older people that Kinsey interviewed for his studies. But once we go deeper into history, we enter the land of inference -- of teasing meanings from poetry, paintings and perhaps the random diary passage. Sex was in the dark for thousands of years of human history. Kinsey turned on the floodlights. The film shows how his background and temperament made him ideally positioned to become a revolutionary. We see him, as a child, under the thumb of his father, a bullying minister (John Lithgow) who's not even into tough love, just tough hate. As an adult, Kinsey (Liam Neeson) becomes a biologist at Indiana University and specializes in studying gall wasps. Obsessive and thorough, he collects a million specimens. Later, he would apply the same dispassionate rigor to his study of people. The film is told largely in flashback, as Kinsey trains his researchers by having them interview him. He's a stern boss, insisting that his staff learn never to react or express any value judgment in the course of a survey. Kinsey has personal reasons for emphasizing the importance of accurate information. As newlyweds, he and his wife (Laura Linney) had difficulty having sex. But because they had the means and the sense to consult a doctor, their marriage soon became a jolly frolic. He's at mid-career when a conversation with a pair of married students makes him aware of the paucity of reliable sex research. Kinsey finds his new passion and enters history by opening his research institute on the Indiana University campus. This is over the objections of some prudish colleagues, including one played by Tim Curry, who makes an ideal prude: He looks as if he might have something to hide. As a character study, Kinsey is a rewarding subject, a man who cannot escape his past, whose life is defined by his rebellion against everything his father stood for. Disillusioned early by his father's uncharitable version of Christian ethics, Kinsey finds it difficult, as an adult, to recognize any moral value at all. Neeson's performance is alive to all these nuances. He also manages to suggest that Kinsey's meticulous focus on the mechanistic aspects of sex was a mask for other unconscious impulses driving his life. Accordingly, his enemies are not exactly wrong to feel threatened by him. He's not a dispassionate chronicle, but a scientist fashioning his research into a club with which to smash the conventional. Writer-director Bill Condon is honest enough to admit that the consequences of this aren't entirely positive. Within Kinsey's own institute, the researchers -- emboldened in their behavior by their privileged awareness that almost everyone is doing something naughty -- start living according to a more impromptu set of morals. This allows Condon a chance to do something ingenious, to present, within the institute's confines, a petri-dish version of the sexual mores about to be released into the cultural atmosphere: lots of mess, lots of complication -- with a few prudes off to the side wanting to burn everybody at the stake. No, it's not a pretty sight, but it sure is familiar. Kinsey gets it right.. -- Advisory: Nonstop talk about sex, sexual situations, full-frontal nudity. ",1
"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang: Action comedy. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan. Directed by Shane Black. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) These changes, and others, are worked to comic and sometimes hilarious effect. Yet it's the wonder of Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang that, despite its comic moments and its constant winking at the audience, it still succeeds in dramatic terms. It's still an exciting-enough thriller. Black, who wrote the original Lethal Weapon, walks that line, and it's not an easy line. That he manages it has something to do with instinct, something to do with experience, something to do with flair -- but really what we're talking about here is talent, that cruel and random thing. There is so much talent on display in Kiss Kiss that it will annoy some people. It's a smarty-pants movie, full of wise attitude and cute genre references. That's fine. People who dislike smarty-pants movies can skip this one. There are plenty of stupid-pants movies to choose from. Robert Downey Jr. stars as a petty thief from New York who is mistaken for an actor and sent to Los Angeles for possible work on a movie. The circumstances of the casting directors' confusion make for the first laugh-out-loud moment in the picture. Now Harry (Downey) is walking around a Hollywood party. It's night; there's a pool, and there are plenty of strange people, some imitating human beings, some not even trying. Though it's all couched in comedy, it's about as bleak a representation of socializing as anything on film. Black establishes the tone early. Harry's self-conscious narration is full of stops and starts, digressions and corrections, and a couple of times, the film freezes and goes backward or shifts to another scene that should have been mentioned earlier. Harry's not a good narrator, he tells us, but he's the only one we've got. But Black doesn't just spoof classic Hollywood style; he emulates it. With an economy bordering on the obvious, he uses the party to introduce all the key characters, the most important of which are Perry, a gay detective played by Val Kilmer, and Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), an actress whose career is going nowhere. Harry takes one look at Harmony and falls in love, then realizes that he knew her in high school and was crazy about her then, too. Monaghan and Downey hardly look as if they could have been schoolmates. The movie could have accounted for the discrepancy by saying that she spent 10 years cryogenically frozen or that he spent that long eating nothing but toxic waste. Instead, Black chooses not to explain it, and soon the reason for their casting becomes apparent: Their comic rhythms are in perfect synch. At times, it seems as if they're improvising, inspiring and topping each other. Harry and Harmony share an affinity for old-time crime fiction -- specifically for fictitious novels featuring the Los Angeles detective Jonny Gossamer -- a predilection that Black shrewdly weaves into a complicated story involving the deaths of two women. By having the characters talk about the Gossamer novels, Black telegraphs what's going to happen later in the movie. In a particularly mischievous moment, he all but announces the ending in advance, at an early stage when such an ending is unimaginable. Black is calling attention to his own virtuosity, which would be obnoxious if he couldn't back it up. But he can. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang mocks, celebrates, wallows in and ultimately exemplifies the allure of the traditional Hollywood formula. Pauline Kael used the title Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang for one of her collections of film reviews because she considered it a succinct summary of the movies' appeal. Black's postmodern take lives up to its title, though an added Laugh Laugh might have said it all. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity, sexual situations and violence. ",1
"Kontroll: Drama. Starring Sándor Csányi and Eszter Balla. Directed by Nimród Antal. (Rated R. 106 minutes. Hungarian with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters). Kontroll is a Hungarian film -- an existential thriller, one might call it -- about an intelligent man who happens to have this lowly nuisance of a job. He leads a crew and rides the various lines, stopping people and annoying them. That's what he does by day. By night, he just walks around or rides the trains. When it's time to go to sleep, he goes to the deepest part of the subway system and sleeps on a platform. He never goes above ground, and neither does the movie, which was filmed entirely inside the subway system, with the permission of the authorities. The subway turns out to be a compelling location, and keeping the film down there has a cumulative impact. As we watch the trains coming and going, the doors opening and closing at empty stations at all hours of the night, the subway seems to take on a metaphorical significance. It's as if we were seeing an entire city's unconscious mental life, a neurotic and ceaseless pattern of ever-repeating actions being rehearsed and imagined underneath the city's surface. It all looks impersonal, ugly and sad, and yet to stay down there is to feel as though one is privy to some kind of truth. Bulcsú (Sándor Csányi) is a handsome fellow, with an alert mind and an engaging manner, so why is he spending his life practically buried? It's one of the movie's mysteries. The other is the identity of a subway killer, who is going around pushing people onto the tracks. Bulcsú and his crew are on the lookout for him. The movie is mainly a series of peculiar incidents involving ticketless passengers, who all lie about it. (Being a controller gives one a jaded impression of humanity.) Forward motion is provided by the thriller plot, involving the serial killer. Yet in the end, what audiences will most remember are the interludes of Bulcsú looking around, exploring the subway's depths. That he ultimately comes up against a cement wall may sound crudely symbolic, but the underground setting is, in itself, so fantastic, so unmoored from reality, that such moments are unforced. Kontroll is singular in its location and singular in mood. This is the first feature from Nimród Antal, who must be as personally charming as he is professionally able, because he somehow persuaded the authorities to let him film in the subway, even though he makes controllers look like a sorry lot of misfits. And he has kept them happy, too, apparently: A real-life Budapest subway officer introduces the film with a friendly onscreen prologue. -- Advisory: This film contains blood and violence. ",1
"Kung Fu Panda: Animation. Starring (the voices of) Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. Directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson. (PG. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)First, about that title, Kung Fu Panda. On the plus side, it kind of says it all, doesn't it? Just lays it right out there. On the downside, well ... it kind of says it all, doesn't it? This is a movie about a kung fu fighting panda. And because it's an animation - and because animations tend to be overly skewed toward the rags-to-riches plot formula - you know at once the general outline of the story from beginning to end. He's going to start off a little sad. He's going to be under-estimated. Then he's going to be challenged. And, oh, maybe along the way he might get into a kung fu fight or two. Do you think he's going to lose? Get a concussion? Get killed? Or by chance, do you think he might be triumphant and get hailed as a hero. That's a multiple-choice question, and if you're over the age of 8, you know the answer. Now what most filmmakers do with a movie like this is figure, hey, this is a movie for children 8 or under, so what if this is an old formula? The kids haven't seen it all before, and if their parents have, so what? No one asked them to have children. These parents made a choice, and now they have to watch a lot of ghastly children's movies. Sex and the City is playing in the auditorium next door, and Iron Man is on the other side, but they have to spend Saturday afternoon watching kids' movies, take it and like it.  But Kung Fu Panda is different. Yes, it essentially follows the broad outline of a rags-to-riches children's movie, but it wakes up the formula with imaginative scenes, lively and likable characters, genuinely funny moments and animation that's detailed and beautiful to behold. At times, it looks almost three-dimensional. (I didn't see the IMAX version and can only imagine how good that looks.) This is a streamlined, opulent and thoroughly enjoyable kids movie.  In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this is probably the best movie so far this year about a kung-fu fighting panda - and that it will probably stand as the best until Kung Fu Panda II, if that ever comes along.  It has a good hero. He's fat and cuddly. He's not homely like Shrek. He's cute, and he has nice teeth. He's voiced by Jack Black, who brings lots of energy and new shadings and colors to his vocal work. The latter could also be said for Dustin Hoffman, who plays the tiny kung fu master. His is one of the most recognizable voices in movies. (Listen very closely ... Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me? You can hear it, right?) Yet it takes a while to realize the master is indeed Hoffman.  Kung Fu Panda is neither sentimental nor does it try for overly clever anti-sentiment. It tells the straightforward story of Po the panda, a kung fu fan whose life is limited by his endless work in his father's noodle restaurant. There's a brilliant early sequence in which Po rushes off to the Dragon Warrior competition, a huge stadium event. The camera pulls backward over a bustle of activity, then drops and drops to find Po at the bottom of a long stairway with his noodle wagon. He watches the proceedings from a porthole and from a crack in the door and never stops trying to get in until, by accident, he finds himself in the center of the arena. In that sequence and throughout, Kung Fu Panda gets across important and inevitable plot information in ways that are novel and unexpected. Things simply don't happen the way they usually happen in animated stories. Martial arts training, for example, is usually accomplished through a montage with some loud triumphal music blaring over the soundtrack. Here, the filmmakers come up with a funny way for Po to be trained, involving his prodigious (bear-appropriate) appetite for goodies. Other famous voices featured are those of Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey) and Seth Rogen (Mantis), but directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson keep the performances self-effacing and in service of the story. They don't perform their star personalities, and if you didn't know who they were, going in, you probably wouldn't guess.",1
"L'Auberge Espagnole: Comedy-drama. Starring Romain Duris, Judith Godreche and Cecile De France. Directed by Cedric Klapisch. (R. 116 minutes. In English, and in French, Catalan, Spanish and German with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) It's the last year of free time. The last year of hanging out. The last year to spend on simply living. Few movies have ever conveyed that sense so well, but L'Auberge Espagnole benefits further from its setting and moment in time. Taking place in an apartment in Barcelona, filled with struggling exchange students from all over the continent, the movie quite consciously embodies the promise of a new united Europe. Within this overarching context, the personal stories take on an added significance. Romain Duris plays Xavier, a young economics student who is told he needs to take a few more courses and learn Spanish before he can take a job with a prestigious firm. Director Cedric Klapisch does something hitherto unique in these early scenes. He literally fast-forwards through the exposition, just as one might when watching a video. The object is to get Xavier on that plane to Barcelona, so the movie can really start. Sitting on the plane, he starts weeping, already missing his life in France and his girlfriend (Audrey Tautou). The moment sweetly and unexpectedly reminds the audience of the vulnerability beneath youth's invincible facade and the dramatic upheavals associated with life at that age. L'Auberge Espagnole literally means Spanish Inn, but in French the phrase also suggests the presence of disparate cultures under a single roof, a place where anything can happen. After a couple of false starts, Xavier lands an interview with the people who will become his roommates, and he's utterly charmed by their polyglot banter and chaotic rapport. Once in, he helps bring in Isabelle (Cecile De France), a young Belgian woman he's attracted to, only to discover that she's a lesbian. Still, Isabelle is able to help Xavier in the sex department by showing him in detail how he should seduce a woman, a technique he puts into immediate practice on an attractive married friend, played by Judith Godreche. With her sensitive intelligence, deer-in-the-headlights expression and voluptuous physicality, Godreche is undoubtedly the international cinema's most womanly waif. The household is well cast. Kelly Reilly as Wendy, the English girl, couldn't possibly look more English, with her freckled face and full figure. National stereotypes are neither emphasized nor strenuously eschewed. And so, the German student really is more neat and organized than his Italian roommate, but no one is singing Deutschland Uber Alles or exclaiming Mamma mia, that's a spicy meatball. What comes across, interestingly, is that the Europeans' stereotypes about each other are no more evolved than those Americans might possess. Throughout, characters chide each other for their narrow preconceptions -- that the Spanish are dirtier than the French, or prouder than the English. At the same time, when a pair of French lovers go off into a room together, their friends can't resist saying, Ooh, la, la. A balance is being struck. The roommates are finding ways to recognize cultural differences, to see each other as individuals and to find a common bond in their European identity. Lest these seem like small triumphs, keep in mind that twice in the 20th century these people slaughtered each other and tore the world apart. Another such war seems unthinkable when watching L'Auberge Espagnole, which shows how far Europe has come. For an American audience, the only disheartening aspect is that in this lovefest the odd man out may very well be . . . us. L'Auberge Espagnole has only one American character, and he's a complete imbecile, going around with an acoustic guitar. Needless to say, only the English girl will have anything to do with him, and even she knows he's an idiot. . This film contains strong language. ",1
"LAKEBOAT: Comedy-drama. Starring Robert Forster, Peter Falk, Charles Durning and Tony Mamet. Directed by Joe Mantegna. (R. 98 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) The play, one of his first, breaks a rule that Mamet himself would later espouse, that every element should serve the story. There's not much of a story here to serve, just a situation: A young graduate student takes a summer job on a Great Lakes freighter and meets the crew, colorful middle-aged men with stories to tell. The graduate student, Dale, is played by Tony Mamet, the playwright's brother, and, while not incompetent, he is the cast's weak link -- a little too old, a little too cynical, a little too cold next to the vibrant humanity of the other players. The story is based on the playwright's own experience working as a summer intern on a freighter, but, wisely, Mamet doesn't give us the ship as seen entirely through Dale's eyes. Sometimes Dale witnesses a scene. Other times, the audience is privy to conversations Dale never hears -- for example, a wonderfully ridiculous discussion of drinking between two members of the crew. Don't talk to me about drinking, one repeats over and over, as he talks about beer, wine and spirits. Women don't understand drinking. They don't understand it. The earthiness of Mamet's writing could make some mistake him for a realist. He's not. The dialogue in Lakeboat has the heightened truth of poetry. The frequent repetitions, the iambic cursing, the abrupt and unexplained changes of mood -- it's not real speech. It evokes real speech, concentrates it, reveals the meanings underneath. Richard Burton once said that Shakespeare's writing should be spoken neither as poetry nor as prose but in between. That's how Mamet should be played, and no one understands that better than Mantegna, who originated the role of Ricky Roma in Glengarry Glen Ross and is the consummate Mamet actor. Mantegna has his actors play Lakeboat just outside the edges of naturalism. In so doing, he gives the movie the dreamy quality of a recollection, while amplifying the comedy. The movie's one running joke is especially funny. In the movie's first scene, a dock worker (Peter Falk) tells Dale an elaborate story about the ship's cook getting rolled in a bar and then fired for drunkenness. Later, throughout the film, different crew members tell Dale different versions of the same story -- one involving the feds, another the Mafia. The story gets more and more and far-fetched with each telling. Denis Leary, Charles Durning, George Wendt and J.J. Johnston (another fine Mamet actor) each get their moments, but the standout is Robert Forster (Jackie Brown), who forms the strongest bond with Dale and, in two strong and poignant scenes, opens up to him. He tells him about some life disappointments that led him to the brink of suicide. In another scene -- so simple yet brimming with unstated affection and mystery -- Forster asks the young man about his life and tells him, You got it made. Lakeboat, comic in many ways, goes to a rich emotional place by the finish. ",1
"LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT: Romantic drama. Starring Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns. Directed by Stephen Hereck. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That setup, as well as the suspense that goes with it, takes this romantic drama a long way toward excellence. What brings it home are two stars who are easy on the eyes (Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns) and a screenplay that's actually about something. Life or Something Like It deals with the difficulty of striking the right balance -- between living for today and going nowhere or living for tomorrow and having no life. Along the way it dares to suggest something that women often say but movies about women never have the nerve to acknowledge: Sometimes a woman can't have it all. To reach the top of one's profession requires a lifetime commitment that entails hard choices and sacrifice. Jolie plays Lanie, a local TV journalist in Seattle with future network stardom written all over her. That's something we have to accept on faith, since Jolie doesn't make it easy. It's a weakness of Jolie's performance that she didn't bother perfecting her news technique for the role. Her delivery is far too slow for television, and her on-camera demeanor would register as snide and off-putting in any market. But Jolie brings other things to the table that are more important. First of all, there's the walk. She walks like trouble. She walks like some jungle creature, so when we see her, in a business suit and a confining hairstyle, we get the point before anyone tries to tell us. This is a woman whose ambition is constraining her. This is a woman funneling enormous energy into a life dream that may ultimately be confining. Before the street prophet (Tony Shalhoub) tells her that she has a week left, she believes her life to be perfect. She is up for a network job, and she is engaged to a star baseball player. In an early scene we see the glamorous couple walking out of a limousine, waving to fans -- and we know before they do that this is what their relationship is all about, this moment of standing there looking enviable. They don't look like a couple but like someone's idea of one. After she hears the prediction -- even though she doesn't fully believe it - - she starts to look at her life. This is where the movie could turn hokey but doesn't. There's no methodical self-examination and no moment of fake revelation, just a letting down of her guard. Jolie knows how to play a woman loosening up. Our heroine skips bathing, wears her glasses instead of contacts, smokes, goes off her diet and blasts music. This may be no way to live on a daily basis, but we understand. Something is coming apart, and maybe something has to. The movie contrasts Lanie's future-directed approach to life with that of her cameraman, Pete, played by Burns with his usual laid-back, decent-guy charm. Pete doesn't worry about getting ahead. He worries about finding pleasure in the moment, though the film ever so subtly suggests that his responsibilities might be slightly different if he were a woman. Director Stephen Herek has made some good movies (Rock Star, 101 Dalmatians, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead!), though until now no one could ever have accused him of subtlety. But Life or Something Like It has a quiet confidence. It makes its points with economy and understatement, and that goes for the performances, too. Jolie goes through a lot in the course of the movie, but while Herek could have emphasized Lanie's transformation, he plays it down. Lanie remains the same person, as she would in life. Herek also keeps Jolie's mannerisms and eccentricity in check and brings out what is apparently her genuine live-wire intelligence. The result is a worthy woman's film and Jolie's best showcase to date. ",1
"LIKE MIKE: Sports fantasy. Starring Lil' Bow Wow, Morris Chestnut and Robert Forster. Directed by John Schultz. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) One wouldn't automatically think of rap as a training ground for actors, but it's proving to be a gold mine -- look at LL Cool J, who has proved himself a fine and versatile talent. (The late Tupac Shakur wasn't bad, either, and neither are Ice T, Ice Cube and Will Smith.) What's especially refreshing about Lil' Bow Wow is that he's cheerful and fresh. The usual rap on rappers is that they tend to be unsmiling, but Bow's face is an open book. He plays Calvin, a 14-year-old living in a Los Angeles orphanage. The first minutes of this movie let viewers know they're in good directorial hands. Director John Schultz gives the orphanage a gritty, grainy look. On the weekend, prospective parents visit and immediately gravitate toward the toddlers and infants, while the older kids watch dejectedly. It's a sad and rather uncompromising beginning for a comedy, but it works, grounding the fantasy to come in a tough realistic world. The turning point in Calvin's life arrives when charity apparel is donated to the home, and he ends up with a pair of secondhand sneakers with the initials M.J. written in marker inside. From the moment Calvin puts on the sneakers, he becomes an unstoppable basketball phenomenon, capable of getting by any defender, though barely 5 feet tall. Typical of the many amusing scenes here is one in which Calvin is chosen at random during halftime to play one-on-one with a member of a Los Angeles team's starting five. To the delight of the packed arena, Calvin finds himself able to score at will against an opponent twice his size. He can score from the outside, and he can also slam dunk the ball by flying through the air toward the basket. Jordan only looked as if he could fly. Calvin really can. In addition to telling a hard-to-beat sports story -- a kid joins the NBA -- Like Mike tells an affecting tale about a boy with a deep longing for parents and the bond that develops between him and a fussy, finicky fellow player. From all appearances, Tracy (Morris Chestnut) is the quintessential bachelor with no interest in setting down roots, but the movie -- and Chestnut -- let us see, in an unforced way, how being around Calvin might awaken a paternal instinct. The screenplay's emphasis on personal relationships, and not just winning and losing, makes Like Mike something more than a typical sports movie. It also gives Lil' Bow Wow something to do besides dribble between his legs. It allows an alert and engaging performance to take wing. In this context, the sports scenes are just the icing on the cake. They're nicely staged. Here we have Lil' Bow Wow playing opposite players who dwarf him, and yet the game choreography is smooth enough to allow us to believe that the big guys aren't just letting him win. Near the finish, the movie indulges in some tiresome complications, and a chase scene goes on too long and makes for dull viewing -- it's as if the filmmakers' hearts weren't in it, and why should they have been? In any case it's a minor blemish that takes little away from this appealing movie, one of the summer's pleasant surprises. ",1
"LOVELY & AMAZING: Comedy-drama. Starring Catherine Keener, Brenda Blethyn and Emily Mortimer. Directed by Nicole Holofcener. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Holofcener's strategy -- to make a movie almost entirely character driven, not plot driven -- is often attempted, but rarely with success. The reason is simple: Filmmakers who eschew story usually do so because they can't write one, and filmmakers who can't write stories usually can't write characters, either. Holofcener is not in either category. Here, as in her previous film, Walking and Talking, she gives us characters that are distinct and quirky, yet instantly recognizable. And having shown them to us, she has a way of jerking us right into the center of their pain. Take the way she introduces us to Michelle, an unhappily married would-be artist, played by Catherine Keener. Michelle is in a gift shop, trying to sell some little art sculptures she's made, when she runs into an old schoolmate. As soon as she finds out that the schoolmate is a successful pediatrician, she feels at a disadvantage, and when the store refuses to buy anything -- with the pediatrician standing there listening -- oh, the embarrassment. In little more than 90 seconds, we not only know Michelle but we're also right there with her, squirming. Lovely & Amazing is about three sisters in various states of personal dissatisfaction. They feel a need to fix themselves, even though they're fine. Why can't they see their own lovely amazingness? Blame society -- or Mom. Brenda Blethyn plays the mother, whose liposuction surgery is the event around which the movie's modest story is arranged. Though all the sisters get their due, Holofcener seems especially passionate in presenting the traumas and anxieties of Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), as an actress who might be on the cusp of a serious career. As presented by Holofcener, the career of a young actress is only marginally less degrading than prostitution. When we first see her, she is posing for a publicity photo, wearing a dress that she realizes is transparent. Later, she goes to an audition, where she is told to act really sexy -- which means having to have a passionate make-out session with some creepy Hollywood actor (Dermot Mulroney). Obviously, there are worse ways to make a living, but Holofcener doesn't pull her punches. To pursue a career that's all about looks, youth and sexuality is to endure a psychic toll. Elizabeth's professional preoccupation with her looks leads to a jaw- dropping scene in which she stands naked in front of a man with whom she's just had casual sex and asks him to critique her body, in cold detail. What makes the scene extraordinary -- and doubly pointed on Holofcener's part, and courageous on the part of Mortimer -- is that the scene was clearly written about Emily Mortimer's body, specifically. Mortimer may be lovely, but in a critique like that, almost anybody's body would get ripped to shreds. The youngest sister is Annie (Raven Goodwin), an adopted 8-year-old whose mother was a crack addict. Though not genetically related to the rest of the family, she seems to have inherited the family disease. She's a black girl who wants to look white, so she goes out and gets her hair straightened. Lovely & Amazing shows how free-floating insecurity can poison a woman's relationships with lovers and family members, but the movie also holds out hope. The holding out hope part is where things clunk a bit near the finish - - characters do have a way of suddenly getting pleasant with The End breathing down their necks. Still, Holofcener doesn't force it, and she maintains the movie's integrity by not trying to tie it up in too neat a bundle. Lovely & Amazing remains to the end a bit ragged, a bit ambiguous, a bit up in the air, and a lot like life. . This film contains full frontal nudity and harsh language. ",1
"Lakeview Terrace: Suspense thriller. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Patrick Wilson. Directed by Neil LaBute. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)  In its overall shape and message, Lakeview Terrace is a conventional suspense thriller, but the details kick it up a notch. There's a racial element that's unexpected. There's a narrative strategy that's slightly innovative. And then there's Samuel L. Jackson's face and everything he can do with it: the impassive look. The burning-holes-through-concrete stare. The smile that's the opposite of reassuring. And the laugh that says, You're so dead. There may be no actor working today with a better sense of how to use his face and what each expression communicates to an audience. Directed but not scripted by Neil LaBute, the film continues LaBute's ongoing investigation into the sheer hell that is other people. We first meet Abel (Jackson) as he's waking up on a typical weekday. He says his prayers, gets the kids up and serves them breakfast. He endures wise remarks from his teenage daughter, then spends some time folding the kids' laundry. He's a widowed dad and seems like a nice enough guy. And then the new neighbors move in. It's a nice touch: LaBute shows us the new neighbors' van pull up in one unbroken shot from Abel's perspective. The neighbors are a source of mystery and of mild consternation to him - and thus to us, as well. And then somehow, seamlessly, and very early into the story, LaBute and screenwriters David Loughery and Howard Korder make the switch: There's absolutely nothing wrong with the neighbors. It's Abel who's a bit strange. He might even be a little crazy. You know, with suppressed rage.  So right off the top, the entertainment value is guaranteed. We have a movie that explores what it would be like to move into a nice neighborhood and find that your next-door neighbor is Jackson in his angry mode. But no, it's even better than that: Not only is Jackson angry, but he's also a Los Angeles police officer, which means he carries a gun and is regarded as a citizen beyond reproach. And he has floodlights all over his property, so that the lights shine through the bedroom of his neighbors' house. And he won't turn them off. Abel takes an immediate dislike to the neighbors, when he sees that they're an interracial couple. Lisa (Kerry Washington) is black, and Chris (Patrick Wilson) is white. When Abel meets Chris, he makes little digs, shifting between ambiguous hostility and Jackson's own patented variety of stone-cold geniality. When he hears Chris listening to hip-hop, he tells him, You can listen to that noise all night, but when you wake up in the morning, you'll still be white. Thirty-five or 40 years ago, Sidney Poitier might have played the young husband, married to a white woman, and Rod Steiger or someone equally combustible would have been cast in the Jackson role. That a black actor gets to play the race-obsessed angry man might be considered some sign of progress, but as a story Lakeview Terrace is pretty much by the book. Can't we all get along here? Three guesses.  The fun of Lakeview Terrace is not in what happens but in how it happens. The fun is in gauging Abel's rage, as well as his thinking, and in enjoying Jackson's virtuosity. As a director, LaBute knows exactly the hand he's playing with this film. He knows that he has a plot that just rearranges and recombines some suspense movie cliches, but he also knows he has some smart, unsettling dialogue, a handful of strong scenes and three good actors in the lead roles. Further, he knows that his movie will succeed if he does two things: if he lets Jackson be scary, and if he has Jackson's co-stars look frightened.  To that end, LaBute photographs Jackson straight on, looking into the camera. He punctuates scenes with Jackson's glances, every one some version of menace. Watching Jackson, the audience experiences the double kick that sometimes happens with familiar film stars: We get taken up in the action of the character even as we take specific delight in the movie star's laying out his bag of tricks for our pleasure. Without Jackson, it would be difficult to imagine Lakeview Terrace adding up to anything. With Jackson, we believe in the terror of the characters and feel on a gut level what they're up against. At one point, our hero (Wilson) thinks someone has invaded his house, so he picks up a lacrosse stick as a weapon and starts waving it. Oh, the hopelessness of that tableau - to think he can go up against Samuel L. Jackson armed with just a lacrosse stick.  -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and violence.",1
"Lars and the Real Girl: Comedy-drama. Starring Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, Kelli Garner and Paul Schneider. Directed by Craig Gillespie. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Some people probably like the idea of going to a movie about a guy and his sex mannequin, but for those who don't, a qualification is in order. Lars and the Real Girl is not about sex. At no point does the protagonist have carnal (or plastic) knowledge of the mannequin. Likewise, saying this gives away no plot point. Virtually from the first minutes, the movie establishes that the man-doll relationship is and will remain chaste. They're saving themselves for marriage.Lars and the Real Girl is a gentle comedy, offbeat but never cute, never lewd and never going for shortcut laughs that might diminish character. From looking at stills of the movie, one could be led to expect something arch and knowing, but the film is anything but that. It's an emotionally invested movie about loneliness and the lingering scars of early trauma.At the center of it is Ryan Gosling, who at 26 is already a mature talent - not the usual flashy, appealing fellow, but deep-revolving and mysterious. Gosling shows you plenty but leaves you with the feeling that there's much more he's not showing. Usually with movies, we see everything. But in real life, we talk to people and hear them and feel we understand - even while realizing we'll never know them inside and out. The depths are apparent, and we see hints of them, but they're never fully open to our inspection. Watching Gosling is much more like the experience of real life than the movies.Just in itself, it's remarkable that Gosling, without saying much, establishes from the beginning that, whatever is going on with Lars, it's benign. Lars is so shy and leery of human contact that he can barely bring himself to speak to anyone. He greets the world with a tight, uncomfortable grin. Easily, with another actor, Lars could have come across as one of those nice quiet guys who snap and kill everybody in sight, but Gosling does something with his eyes that tells you that that's not the deal here. There's a sweetness and softness about him, which makes it clear why everyone really likes him, even though he puts out less energy than a dead battery.So when he finds a girl with even less life force than he has - specifically, a life-size plastic sex mannequin that he buys on the Internet - it's a meeting of true minds. Lars is delusional. He believes that Bianca is real, that she talks to him, that she's from Brazil, that she can't walk and that she's very religious. The latter means that, while he sleeps in his garage apartment, she sleeps in the main house, where his brother (Paul Schneider) lives with his pregnant and very giving wife (Emily Mortimer). That would seem to be the setup for a decent skit, but writer Nancy Oliver finds a whole screenplay in it, by conscientiously pursuing the premise, investigating the fears, the wants and the pain that might lead to such a delusion, without losing sight of the comedy. This impressive balancing act continues until the final shot, and the movie's only weaknesses are minor ones. Some of the bits involving the community's reactions are far-fetched, and there's more of that element than the movie needs. Schneider gets some of the best laughs as Lars' horrified older brother, and Patricia Clarkson brings a nice exhausted humanity to her role as a psychiatrist. By the way, there is a real girl in Lars. She's a co-worker played by Kelli Garner, a gorgeous actress who is convincingly plain-Janed up for her role here. Garner is choosing good roles in quality movies, and it's paying off. She was brilliant in Dreamland and delivers the goods in Lars as well.-- Advisory: This film contains adult subject matter and a pink bowling ball.",1
"Layer Cake: Drama. Starring Daniel Craig, Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon. Directed by Matthew Vaughn. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Layer Cake is the first film from director Matthew Vaughn, who produced the Guy Ritchie crime pictures Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Layer Cake shares with the Ritchie films a somewhat convoluted plot and a view of criminal life as an absurd existential condition. But unlike Ritchie, Vaughn doesn't use that as a license to make his film into an absurd experience. There are colorful characters and moments of humor, but Vaughn maintains a straight tone. His narrative innovations are subtle, there for the sake of putting over the story, not the director. A characteristically clever but smooth touch comes in the first moments. As the unnamed coke dealer (Craig), identified as XXXX in the credits, delineates the rules by which he conducts his business, we see on screen various people and activities that exemplify what not to do. He says, for example, Avoid attention-seeking gangsters, while we see exactly such a character talking into a cell phone, making a flashy display of himself on a crowded street. At first, these seem like mere examples, but gradually we realize that we're in fact seeing the dangerous lowlifes with whom our hero will soon be involved. He won't want to be, but circumstances will take over. In his opening voiceover, the protagonist talks about how he has finally socked away enough money to quit crime and become a man of leisure. Uh-oh. Look out. The audience's expectation, of course, is that something will go wrong, but Layer Cake exceeds expectations. It sets in motion three separate plot strands, each compelling in its own right, each involving risk and promising a big reward. These strands play out, intertwine and eventually tie themselves into a big knot around the hero's neck, making it almost unimaginable how he might extricate himself. His trouble is our fun at the movies. The fun begins when XXXX's supplier -- Kenneth Cranham, exuding menace as a cockney slob -- hands him two difficult assignments, one of which involves the purchase of a million tablets of Ecstasy from a band of violent, mentally unbalanced wackos. XXXX is just a businessman, who doesn't even own a gun. He's going to need one. He further complicates his life by going to a nightclub and letting himself be seduced by the girlfriend (Sienna Miller) of one of his associates. Resistance is futile. The special appeal of Layer Cake derives from its efficient, gripping story and from the personality of the unnamed protagonist, who is not a criminal hotshot, just an intelligent amateur, improvising. Rooting for him is easy. He's also a compelling character, in that he seems to have a moral nature and at the same time indicates no discomfort or disapproval in his association with murderers -- such as his boss' hatchet man (Colm Meaney). Likewise, he keeps crossing major moral boundaries without indicating that he's noticed. He is of our world and of that world at the same time. The title, Layer Cake, refers to some philosophical patter that a king boss imparts to XXXX, something about how things are different at different levels of the hierarchy. It's not a good analogy, since a layer cake is just as good in the middle as it is on top, but the king boss is played by Michael Gambon, and, in an English movie, nobody tells Gambon to fix his metaphor. He's too high up in the layer cake. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, violence, a decapitated head. ",1
"Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde: Comedy. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Sally Field and Regina King. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) She still wears pink, and she's still perky, and she still has that little dog, but beneath the surface we find a complete reimagining of the character and a subversion of author Amanda Brown's original vision. In Legally Blonde,  politically minded students were lampooned as drab do-gooders, filling their empty hours in organizations like Lesbians Against Drunk Driving. In Legally Blonde 2, Elle has become an animal rights activist, fighting to outlaw animal testing by cosmetic companies. It's such a radical change -- turning a girl in pink into a Pink Lady -- that one has to wonder if director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld (Kissing Jessica Stein) was snickering to himself, as he put songs such as Stephen Stills' For What It's Worth and John Lennon's Power to the People on the soundtrack. The writing team from the last Legally Blonde is gone, replaced by newcomer Kate Kondell and by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake, the duo who wrote Down With Love. The movie begins two years after Legally Blonde left off, with Elle out of law school and ready to marry her law professor boyfriend, played by Luke Wilson. At first Elle seems just as oblivious and self-absorbed as ever, getting the guest list ready for a wedding ceremony to take place at Boston's Fenway Park. Then one day she has an inspiration to invite her dog Bruiser's mother to the wedding -- and is horrified when she discovers that Bruiser's mom is a lab animal. This provides the impetus for the crusade that takes her to Washington, D.C. As in the first Legally Blonde, Elle finds herself in a rigid, staid environment, where her chipper personality gets her pegged immediately as a lightweight. But there are significant differences. In the last film, she used her money and connections to get herself into Harvard Law for the express purpose of getting her boyfriend back. She was there for selfish reasons, taking up space in a place where she didn't belong. Here, she's fighting for something outside herself, and she has as much right to be there as anybody. Legally Blonde 2 finds Elle as a populist in the Frank Capra mode, and the parallels between her and Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington are emphasized. These parallels include a less than ideal relationship with a mentor she idolizes (a congresswoman played by Sally Field with authentic, matter-of-fact authority), an unexpected friendship with a veteran who shows her the ropes (a doorman played by Bob Newhart) and a sentimental fixation with the Lincoln Memorial. Like Down With Love, Legally Blonde 2 wears its ideology comfortably and lightly. So though Elle sneers at having to lobby a Southern congressman (Bruce McGill), who's also a conservative NRA spokesman, she finds him to be a genial guy and her most sincere supporter. This is smart screenwriting, and not just in terms of audience demographics (i.e., keeping the Southern NRA audience happy). In its humble way, the portrayal of Elle's alliance with the conservative congressman is true to the complexities of human nature and the vagaries of politics. Legally Blonde 2 brings back Jennifer Coolidge, as Elle's eccentric hairdresser friend, Paulette, only now Paulette is more dazed and more delightfully bizarre than ever. As Elle, Witherspoon is outlandish but also subtle, always thinking, always feeling, however silly. She benefits enormously from the character's new shadings, which may, in part, have been her own doing. As executive producer, Witherspoon had a hand in everything. The picture does fall down, though, in the place where most political comedies cave in, the scene in which the protagonist must make a speech. In Legally Blonde 2, there comes the moment when Elle must stand up and persuade everybody, but what she says wouldn't persuade anybody, no more than would Chris Rock's speech in Head of State, a political comedy from earlier this year. It's a small quibble, but one of these days it would be nice to see that scene done right. ",1
"Letters From Iwo Jima: Drama. Starring Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (R. 140 minutes. In Japanese with subtitles. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) That it has taken this long says something about the difference between the two world wars and the enemies America faced. World War I -- known then, rather optimistically, as The Great War -- was remembered almost immediately as a profound mistake, while World War II has rightly gone down in history as a moral conflict. The atrocities committed by the Imperial Army against the Allies, such as the Bataan Death March and POW camps that were little better than death factories, have further made it impossible to look back on the war as anything resembling a misunderstanding. Eastwood recognizes this reality, and in response, he does something quite reasonable and mature in depicting the Japanese soldiers. He shows individual acts of courage and nobility, and he presents the average soldiers as regular guys who wish they were somewhere else. But at the same time, he doesn't shy from acknowledging, in gentle but definite ways, that there was something unwholesome in the culture of that army. This unwholesomeness, which we, in the West, might describe as an authoritarian disregard for individual worth, translates into Imperial officers terrorizing the populace. There's an underlying sadism there and also a glorification of suicide, as something not only to be chosen but to be forced on others. In this light, it will be interesting to see how Letters From Iwo Jima plays to Japanese audiences, as the film's two protagonists -- General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and foot soldier Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) -- are hardly true believers and might not even be representative of the majority of their army. They're the harbingers of the modern, men of courage who don't subscribe to the suicide cult. The general tells his men not to kill themselves but to kill the enemy, and Saigo, late in the film, says he doesn't want to die for nothing. He has a new baby he hasn't seen. He wants to go home. We see the lead-up to the battle, in which the general arrives on the island and revamps the entire defense strategy. He halts the construction of trenches and has the soldiers build tunnels and machine-gun nests into the mountain overlooking the beach. In Flags of Our Fathers, we saw how terrifying it was when the sleeping mountain came alive, spouting machine-gun fire. In Letters from Iwo Jima, we see how frightening it was to be on the inside of the mountain, as bombs dropped and American soldiers swarmed. In one indelible moment, an incendiary bomb comes through a crevice and a Japanese soldier is consumed in flames. It happens in an instant. In this film, unlike other war films, bombs don't just land nearby. They land on individuals. Eastwood uses a washed-out color palette, so that the movie, technically in color, is virtually in black and white for most of the sequences. The film is long and bleak, not the easiest of Eastwood's films to love, but its authenticity and solemn purpose are unmistakable, and Watanabe -- as a noble, rational man presiding over the annihilation of his own army -- presents a complex character study. From the American standpoint, the Japanese remained formidable for weeks. From the Japanese perspective, the battle began as a foregone conclusion, and it was just a matter of holding on for as long as possible in the face of superior force, limited ammunition and the lack of food and water. At one point, the Japanese are reduced to eating earthworms. Getting to see both sides of an event, not juxtaposed in the same movie but presented separately, with the audience given enough time to feel for the characters and inhabit their world, is unusual. It might be unique, and it serves a useful function quite apart from our understanding of that battle, that war or even war in general. Movies are notorious for exploiting and reinforcing the viewer's tendency to see everything through a subjective lens. Letters from Iwo Jima shows us there are other ways to see. -- Advisory: This film contains graphic violence, carnage and cruelty to animals. ",1
"Let’s start with the bear attack, because it’s one of the most amazing spectacles of the movie year 2015. On its own, it’s reason enough to see “The Revenant,” and there are plenty of other reasons. For weeks, there have been rumors that the scene shows Leonardo DiCaprio getting sexually assaulted by a bear. That does not happen. What happens is even worse.DiCaprio plays a fur trapper, in 1820, out in the Northwest wilderness, who thinks it might be a good idea to shoot a couple of bear cubs. He doesn’t notice the enormous mama bear running up behind him until he turns around just as he’s getting pounced on. What follows is a scene that delivers in a number of extreme and wonderfully conflicting ways.It is harrowing. It is technically remarkable, because there is no doubt in any viewer’s mind that DiCaprio really does have a bear throwing him around and stepping on his head. It is a beautiful piece of bear-fight choreography — it’s clear that serious thought went into how this fight would progress for maximum impact.There’s also just enough emotional distance for us to enjoy what’s happening. The bear, after all, does have a point. And this distance allows us to notice and experience the scene’s other great pleasure: It’s funny. Bears are so cute and cuddly that to see one go berserk on a guy, particularly one who has it coming, has a certain absurd satisfaction.“The Revenant” is loosely based on the real story of Hugh Glass, an American fur trapper who was abandoned by his companions after the unfortunate bear incident and left to die. Despite infections and festering flesh, he somehow survived and navigated his way across 200 miles of hostile wilderness.It’s an amazing survival tale, and the movie itself looks like a survival chronicle. That really is DiCaprio with ice stuck in his beard. That really is DiCaprio wading through and immersing himself in freezing water, over and over. Part of the pleasure of “The Revenant” is in watching freezing people from a warm, cushy seat in a theater.The film is directed by Alejandro Iñárritu in a Terrence Malick (“The New World”) vein, with shots of the sky through the trees, silhouettes against the setting sun and omniscient overviews of the entire landscape. The difference is that with Iñárritu, these are not occasions for philosophical contemplation. Instead, the sky might have arrows flying through it, signaling a new phase in an Indian battle. And the overviews, usually with some lone antlike figure in their midst, are there to remind you that this environment may be breathtaking, but people don’t belong here.Like “Birdman,” and even more than “Birdman,” “The Revenant” is a director’s movie, a showcase for a filmmaker’s vision and innovation. Iñárritu employs long, complicated shots that make full use of the wide screen. Early in the movie, he films an Indian attack in ways that make you realize that every previous director has done it all wrong. The attack comes without warning, from all sides. A character starts calmly barking out orders and is killed mid-sentence. Every moment is a horrible surprise, which, of course, it would be. There is no safe place to look, no safe character to follow.Even a great innovator, though, has his limits, and in attempting to make an endlessly riveting film about a guy trying to crawl and limp for 200 miles, Iñárritu has given himself a daunting assignment. He succeeds, in the sense that his 156-minute movie maintains interest, but the interest is maintained through a series of escalating catastrophes — Glass can’t just go over one waterfall, but several — and stock action-movie situations, such as the lust for revenge. The fresh brilliance of the first hour fades into something more familiar.Tom Hardy exudes an awesome perversity as Glass’ most villainous colleague, but he probably would be more effective if he got past the idea that doing an American accent means talking as if there were marbles in his mouth. Still, he’s a terrific presence.DiCaprio doesn’t get to say much in “The Revenant,” but he does get to cauterize a neck wound with gunpowder (don’t try this at home), the most slapstick improvised health care procedure since Tom Hanks (“Cast Away”) extracted a tooth using an ice skate. And he does get to eat a live fish and dive face first into a buffalo liver. It’s hard to talk about this as a performance, because there’s nothing to compare it to. But if I were an Oscar voter, I might be tempted to vote DiCaprio best actor — or at least to propose a new category be inaugurated, the acting equivalent of the Purple Heart.

"Liam Neeson’s action movies have a built-in appeal, whether good (“Taken,” “Run All Night”) or only so-so (“Taken 3”), but “The Commuter” is securely in the good category. It weds all the winning aspects of the Neeson formula to a ticking-clock plot, full of tense moments and gripping sequences.The big innovation of the Neeson formula — the eureka discovery of “Taken” — is that action can work in a big way when presented as a traditional rags to riches story: Guy starts off down, mistreated, misunderstood. Then there’s a horrible crisis, and he rises to it. He finds complete redemption. Everyone understands that this is one heck of a man.Here’s what’s interesting about this: Other action movies try to galvanize audience interest by making you hate the bad guy. Much is done at the start of such movies to create antipathy and anxiety. But in the Neeson formula, the villains can be vague. We just want Neeson to win because he deserves it, because we know how much he needs it, and because — like all of us — he’s had to put up with plenty and is entitled to a little peace, for crying out loud.And so, at the start of “The Commuter,” they lay it on thick: We see him getting up every morning at 6 a.m., day in and day out, in the summer and the winter. We see him riding the commuter train, into and out of New York City. He and his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) worry about the kid’s tuition. Oh, and by the way, you remember that 2008 recession? He lost everything. Every last penny. Of course, he did. This is Liam Neeson. He can’t lose a quarter of his savings, or half. He had to get wiped out.So one day he goes to work at his job at the insurance agency, and we see what a fine salesman he is, with a genuine concern for his customers. It’s just another day of being a decent person, playing by the rules. And then the boss calls him in, and guess what? They’re laying him off. So he’s 60, has two mortgages, a kid about to start college, and now he’s unemployed.This set-up takes maybe 10 minutes of screen time, and even though it couldn’t be more obvious and manipulative, it’s brilliant. First it’s telling the audience, “This guy is you, or could be you, or your father, or your husband.” Second, this kind of fellow — a humble man of hidden gifts, trying to do the right thing, is perfectly suited to Neeson’s air of put-upon probity. We feel sorry for him, but we also want him to get mad. Because when he gets mad ...So there he is on the train back to the suburbs, pink slip in hand, when a beautiful, mystery woman (Vera Farmiga) sits across from him with a proposition: For $25,000 now and $75,000 later, all he has to do is find someone on the train named “Prynne” and attach a tracking device to this person’s bag. That’s $100,000 — a lot of money to a guy whose mortgage check might bounce, and that’s this month’s mortgage, from the days when he still had a job.Need it be said that things get complicated? That there’s no such thing as an easy 100 grand? We know this going in, but what’s terrific about “The Commuter” is all the ways that it gets complicated. First he’s looking for a bag. Soon he’s firing shots inside the train cabin and yelling, “They’re going to kill my family!” Nobody comes unglued better than Neeson, and no one stays more focused and more intense even as the glue is coming loose. And then there is at least one spectacular action sequence, but you can discover that in the moment.It doesn’t matter that, by the end, most viewers would be hard pressed to pass a quiz about the specifics of the story. Nor should it especially concern us that this movie is very close to a commuter-train remake of Neeson’s “Non-Stop” (2014), set on an airplane. This is a winning formula, and if the ocean liner version of this movie were to open next week, I’d be happy to see it. ",1

Starring Sophie Nelisse, Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. Directed by Brian Percival. (Rated PG-13. 131 minutes.)In The Book Thief, it's 1938 and the wrong time to be young in Germany. A little girl is adopted into a poor family, and the movie traces her trials and adjustments, balancing a personal story with the world going on outside.The resulting film has some wrong notes and touches of preciousness, but mostly it's a moving and effective presentation of life under Nazism, as seen from an unusual angle.The angle is that of non-Jewish Germans, living in a small town - people of no influence or power, just struggling to make a modest living and get through the day.We see what it was like to live under Hitler, and at first, it's not exactly horrible. There is an undertone of anxiety, an awareness that one can't speak freely, and the presence of neighborhood thugs who can't be questioned.But if you keep your head down and your mouth shut, and if you show up for public entertainments and give the Hitler salute, you can pretty much go about your business. But then it gets worse and worse still, hitting every stage of awful on the way to catastrophe.As a storytelling strategy, this forces audiences to experience the war as the characters onscreen experience it, and as real people at the time experienced it - not as the story of their lives, but as an obscene intrusion on their lives. In this way, an old sadness becomes a fresh sadness, and an event out of history that we've processed and filed away becomes renewed in its ability to inspire outrage.From the beginning, Liesel (Sophie Nelisse) is a bit of an outsider. She is motherless, not because her birth mother is dead, but because her mother is a communist and, presumably, has been put in a concentration camp.On Liesel's first day of school, she becomes an object of scorn for not knowing how to read. Later, she learns and becomes a passionate reader, and the movie, justifying its title, keeps coming up with opportunities for Liesel to steal books.For example, at those Nazi book burnings, if you stick around and wait long enough, you can always find a book lying around that was merely singed. And, as the Nazis only burned the best in literature, it's worth the wait.As Liesel, child actress Nelisse brings loveliness and feistiness, the suggestion of innate strength just waiting for the rights and privileges of adulthood.But at least part of Nelisse's performance was also lucky, in that she got to play opposite Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, the extraordinary actors who play her adoptive parents. One could hardly imagine a better lesson in screen acting than to share the frame with those two in this film.Both Rush and Watson convey an entire personal history in these roles. We see them and just know their regrets and anxieties, weaknesses and strengths.As the mother, Watson plays someone who is almost incapable of showing softness, someone harsh and unsmiling, who lives with the burden of having a husband who is no breadwinner, just a sweet, whimsical guy.And yet somehow, without making a point of it, without even seeming to be doing anything in particular, Watson shows us a gentleness of soul.As for Rush, he's the heart of the movie, the kind of person that nobody writes books about, but who changes life for the better by simply being a warm and kind parent, for lavishing time and for always being interested, amused and amusing. This is Rush's warmest performance and one of his best.Based on the Markus Zusak novel of the same name, The Book Thief has a knack for the unexpected detail that just seems right, that makes you think this is what it must have been like, or at least might have been like for somebody.For example, during an air raid, a Jew whom Liesel's parents have been hiding in their basement steps out onto the street for the first time in months. He knows everyone else is in a bomb shelter, and he just wants to see the sky.The movie also contains painterly shots that show the town in almost hyper-detail, as something that once existed that is now etched in memory.Such sublime moments make up for discordant elements - for example, the irritating voiceover narration, spoken by Death, which actually gets in the way of some key moments. Wipe that from the soundtrack and the movie could only improve.",1
"Lions for Lambs: Drama. Robert Redford, Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise. Directed by Robert Redford. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) The lions are the soldiers who do the fighting. The lambs are the unworthy politicians who send them into battle. And Lions for Lambs, the latest from director Robert Redford, is a feature-film response to the war in Iraq and to currents in post-9/11 American life. This is no perfect work of art, but neither is a report from the front. Its strengths are the strengths of journalism, not the strengths of, say, a Tolstoy novel. It's a fictional tale that has the immediacy of something hot off the presses - something raw and clunky, but plugged into the moment - with characters talking about the same things people are talking about outside the theater. Maybe Lions for Lambs will date badly, or maybe it's something people will value as a time capsule. It's impossible to say, but for the time being, this is responsive, engaged filmmaking, the kind of movie they say Americans don't make. It takes place in three locations and depicts events happening concurrently. In the Middle East, two young Army rangers are injured and stranded behind the lines in Afghanistan. Meanwhile in Washington, an ambitious young senator (Tom Cruise) unveils his new Middle East strategy to a television reporter (Meryl Streep). And in California, a political science professor (Robert Redford) tries to convince a gifted student not to devote his life to money and pleasure, but to enter public service.  With this setup, much of Lions for Lambs consists of two-person conversations. The least urgent and the most programmatic of the conversations is the one between the professor and the student. There's nothing really much at stake - something about Andrew Garfield, as the student, makes us not believe in the young man as much as the professor does - and at times Matthew Michael Carnahan's screenplay creaks with piety. But those scenes work anyway because Redford is in them, bringing all his skill and history, not to mention a quality that suggests that if he says it, it must be true. But the real action comes in the scenes between the senator and the journalist. Redford, who has done more than his share of interviews, captures the nature of the dynamic. The interviewer watches and tries not to reveal anything, while the interviewee performs, charms and flatters, while maintaining a discreet air of superiority. It's a cat-and-mouse game in which each participant vies to be the cat, though the cold-blooded nature of the exchange is covered over by a veneer of ease and friendliness. Tom Cruise as a senator? Isn't he like, 28 or something? Actually, he's 45, the same age Jack Kennedy was during the Cuban missile crisis, and Cruise's basic screen personality provides him with the perfect aura to play a political up-and-comer: He's charismatic, gloriously self-satisfied, absolutely convinced, smiling and persuasive, and relentless. Cruise is like that in every movie, and he'd act like that if he were playing Hamlet, too, so you have to cast him right. Redford does. As a Republican senator with a plan to extend, broaden and perpetuate the war, Cruise sounds like he means it and like he's making sense. Lions for Lambs depicts a complacent country that's prey to scheming and deluded politicians, in which the news networks care only about ratings, and the public cares only about vapid celebrities. As the veteran journalist, Streep plays a dinosaur, a 57-year-old woman in television, squeezed between her own integrity and the demands of a compromised medium. She's a marvel to watch. Her listening is absolute, and the progress of her thoughts is clear. One of the saddest and most moving 30 seconds onscreen this year consists of Streep, riding in a taxi, looking at the White House outside her car window ... and then, a moment later, looking at a line of soldiers' gravestones. You know what she's thinking. She's thinking what Redford is thinking and about what Lions for Lambs has been saying all along. -- Advisory: Battlefield violence, gore, strong language.",1
"Long before the special effects kick in, Benedict Cumberbatch makes us interested in “Doctor Strange” and his portrait of a brilliant and arrogant neurosurgeon, who is full of himself but with good reason. Such is the pattern of the best Marvel Comics movies: They’re seductive enough that, even without the superhero antics, they stand up as good stories about interesting people.  Indeed, one of the most dramatic scenes in the entire movie comes near the beginning, when Doctor Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) performs brain surgery to remove a bullet from a man’s head. Without our even knowing who the man is — without the audience being given a single reason to care — director Scott Derrickson nonetheless crafts a tense sequence, in which we end up holding our breath as the doctor performs this difficult procedure. We know already that Doctor Strange is someone we want to spend some time with. He lives in austere splendor in Manhattan, in an apartment with a grand piano and views on all sides. He doesn’t like to be touched. He has an ex-girlfriend, also a doctor (Rachel McAdams), whom he seems to lean on, but not enough to really give of himself. And the only cloud on the horizon, which he can’t see (but we can), is that this simply cannot last. Sooner or later, this fellow is going to be subsumed into the comic-book universe and start doing epic battles against a blue CGI screen. At least the movie takes awhile before it goes into full-tilt action, and even when it does, it never completely loses itself or its central character. Doctor Strange suffers a life-changing calamity that makes him seek alternative forms of healing, and this takes him to Kathmandu and to the school of a special teacher, the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). The Ancient One teaches him how to break the dimensional wall, transcend space and basically go anywhere and do anything using the power of his mind. The movie’s precredit scene gives us a glimpse of this power. In a battle between a team of bad guys, led by familiar movie heavy Mads Mikkelsen, streets split in two, the world turns sideways, buildings assume new shapes. The vision is something like Christopher Nolan’s “Inception,” only without artistry or restraint. We know going in that this is where “Doctor Strange” is ultimately headed, and it’s not reassuring. In essence, the film posits the existence of a world — or worlds — outside the three dimensions. But the rules are vague. Buildings overturned in the extra-dimensional world aren’t necessarily overturned in the dimensional world, though sometimes they are. However, injuries incurred in the extra-dimensional world, for some reason, can be healed only in the dimensional world. That’s why it’s very good that Doctor Strange’s ex-girlfriend is an emergency room doctor.  Fortunately, the movie’s concentration on the extra-dimensional element doesn’t completely suffocate the life out of “Doctor Strange,” but it does some damage. A story that deals in tangible things — work, love, an injury, an expansion into other ways of being — degenerates into sci-fi gobbledygook, with nonsense dialogue spoken in ominous tones: “He folds matter outside the mirror dimension.” I can honestly say that that line makes as much sense to you reading it as to someone who has actually seen the movie. When comic book adaptations really work, they have the power of metaphor. The struggles of the character in the superhero context become the visible means of expressing internal struggles, a way of illustrating universal human experience. Even when we can’t quite put our finger on it and say that this means that, or this stands for that, we feel the psychological connection: Spider-Man is about adolescence and young adulthood. Batman is about experiencing tragedy and overcoming demons. But what do you do, as in “Doctor Strange,” when the metaphor is a lot less interesting than the thing itself?  One thing you can do is what “Doctor Strange,” in fact, does: It casts an actor who is so psychologically compelling that he keeps attention fixed on the turns of his mind, even as worlds are exploding around him. As Stephen Strange, Cumberbatch is restless and never quite at home, too grounded in the physical to embrace the extra-dimensional, and too up in his head to be companionable and earthbound.  Cumberbatch fleshes out a portrait of uncompromised and resolute selfhood. In that way, he carries us and the movie over some long stretches of blue-screen emptiness.

"Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World: Comedy. Starring Albert Brooks and Sheetal Sheth. Directed by Albert Brooks. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For all its silliness, Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World is also a work of integrity. Brooks never finds it necessary to distort reality in the pursuit of laughs. The laughs instead come as a real response to Brooks' touching on fears and concerns present in today's world. There's an ever-so-slightly forlorn undertone, a hint of anxiety that gives the movie an extra dimension. It stays funny and never turns serious, even as it never stops seeming the product of serious reflection. Sometimes it's just refreshing to see a comedy that wasn't made by an idiot, or by someone pretending to be an idiot, or by someone acting like an idiot who wrongly thinks he's just pretending. Brooks counts on his audiences being mentally awake enough to get on his wavelength and catch the jokes, which are often dry, arch and subtle. Brooks plays himself as a worried, vain, down-on-his-luck actor-comedian who is not getting much in the way of movie offers. (The opening scene, in which he goes to Penny Marshall hoping to be cast in a Harvey remake, is wonderfully uncomfortable.) The State Department contacts him, in the person of Fred Dalton Thompson (the actor turned Tennessee senator turned actor), and soon he's in India in a small office with a staff of two American functionaries and an impossibly sweet-natured Indian secretary (Sheetal Sheth). Obligated to produce a 500-page report, he starts asking people on the street what makes them laugh. When that doesn't get the result he wants, he rents a hall and does a stand-up act, in front of a packed house that's as silent as Chaplin's in Limelight. It's a great act, but it depends on cultural associations that the audience doesn't have. He brings out a dummy and does a ventriloquist bit, not even trying to keep his lips closed. Yet more absurdist is his satire of improvisational comedians. He brings out a chalkboard, asks for suggestions from the audience and then, one by one, changes every item on the board to do the lame act he was planning to do in the first place. The stand-up scene, one of handful of terrific comic set pieces, is funny in several ways at once: 1) The sight of him floundering before an uncomprehending crowd is funny; 2) The intentional absurdity of the bits is funny; and 3) The commentary behind the bits is so caustic that it's funny. Brooks isn't just riffing on improvisational stand-up but satirizing it, suggesting that it's neither amusing nor genuinely spontaneous, that the comedians always end up doing what they planned to do, even if they're more subtle about it than Brooks. The Indian stand-up scene is nicely paralleled by one in which Brooks performs outside at night, in some remote location across the border in Pakistan, before a stoned audience of Muslim comedians who might also be terrorists. The indignity of performing for a living has rarely been captured more succinctly than in the moment when Brooks goes around shaking hands with probable terrorists, while singing an a cappella rendition of There's No Business Like Show Business. The world has finally gotten miserable enough to make complete sense of Brooks' misery, and his comedy is taking well to it. -- Advisory: Drug content and strong language. ",1
"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King: Fantasy drama. Starring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Astin. Directed by Peter Jackson. (PG-13. 201 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) We just happen to be living in the time these movies were created, but they're sure to live past our time, their uniqueness unchallenged, their meaning deepening and blossoming, and their flaws receding in importance. However, today is the one day to mention the flaws of the third installment, so let's get that out of the way. Though an estimable success overall, The Return of the King has several scenes too many and too great a concentration on battles. The film's peculiar mix of soaring splendor and excess can perhaps best be illustrated by mentioning that The Return of the King concludes with six or seven scenes in a row, each of which could legitimately end the movie. That's a whole lot of endings. Yet at least four of those endings are powerful enough to bring half the audience to tears. It's a huge movie, but then it's about huge things. Though set in a fantastic prehistoric age of magic, it's nothing less than the story of a world war, one that will determine the course of life on earth. Director Peter Jackson maps out a complicated geopolitical situation, while remaining as faithful as possible to J.R.R. Tolkien's book -- at times, too faithful. In a couple of scenes, it's hard to track who's fighting, or why. Along the way, time is taken for us to know and appreciate the aspirations of individuals acting within that huge framework. Their hopes are simple and timeless: for peace, for comfort, for safety, for a world of moral value, for freedom. Tolkien wrote his trilogy at a time when these standards were under global assault, and we can see traces of the goose-stepping Nazis in the precision of the marching Orc army. Yet because The Lord of the Rings was resolutely not intended as allegory, it transcends its era. Like War and Peace, it's about something enormous but personal, global but individual -- the battle for the human soul, both without and within. So Frodo (Elijah Wood) still has the ring, and he's still trudging toward Mordor. He's accompanied by the faithful Sam (Sean Astin, whose sweet spirit nearly steals the movie), and by Gollum, a computer-generated, slithery creature who looks something like a skinned cat crossed with Frank Gorshin doing his Peter Lorre imitation. Gollum, out of control with greed, plans to kill Frodo and steal the ring. Taking it on faith that Frodo and their cause are still alive, the other members of the Fellowship soldier on. Gandalf (Ian McKellen), now a white wizard, comes to the capital of Gondor and finds the acting King, Denethor (John Noble), unprepared for the coming war and in despair. Gandalf assumes the role of a general and fortifies the city, with the aid of King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the true heir to the throne of Gondor, rides to the aid of Gandalf, accompanied by the elf, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and the dwarf, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). Subtly, Mortensen suggests that gradually Aragorn is growing into the stature of a king. The scene in which he walks into a cave filled with evil spirits, all of them transparent and angry, is dramatically and technically brilliant, a metaphor made real. Though the movie postulates a struggle between the forces of dark and light, the men are not all equally good; some are petty, and alliances are difficult. The Orcs move in lockstep, while the armies of men are more inelegant and disjointed. Is this a strength of democracy or a fatal weakness? We watch as the swarms of Orcs fill the screen, and we dread the unthinkable, that such evil might cover the universe. It is humanity's recurring nightmare. It just keeps coming back. It should be said, of course, that The Return of the King is, at its most visceral level, a grand adventure with lots of fun things to look at: giant, many-trunked elephants tromping across the battlefield. Giant eagles. A giant spider. An army of transparent spirits swarming across enemy lines. The bone-white walls of the Gondor capital crumbling to dust. The churning furnaces of Mount Doom. And the epic convulsions of a kingdom in collapse. But always there's something more, as when Gandalf says, We have come to it at last, the great battle of our time, or when Aragorn exhorts his men as the enemy encircles them. In such moments, the movie reaches us with special recognition, even as it reaches both behind us and past us, with the universality of a classic. It is the old story, the timeless thing. The human struggle, made noble. -- Advisory: This film contains battle violence and a finger being bitten off. ",1
"Lucy (SCARLETT JOHANSSON) is temporarily held hostage by thugs in Lucy, an action-thriller that examines the possibility of what one human could truly do if she unlocked 100 percent of her brain capacity and accessed the furthest reaches of her mind.Lucy (SCARLETT JOHANSSON) is temporarily held hostage by thugs in Lucy, an action-thriller that examines the possibility of what one human could truly do if she unlocked 100 percent of her brain capacity and Sci-fi action drama. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Luc Besson. (R. 90 minutes.) Like some demented combination of Taken and Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, Lucy, the latest from Luc Besson, is a full-out action movie - and a sober rumination on the nature of existence. It is both things, effectively and sincerely. Like Taken, which Besson wrote, it has a streamlined story involving international crime and presents a previously mild-mannered protagonist on a homicidal rampage. And like The Tree of Life, it is bright and opulent, with lots of impressionist visuals, vigorous cutting and even a cameo by a gratuitous dinosaur.  The result is crazy, but in the best way. Lucy hangs together, not only through sheer velocity, but from the unmistakable sense that this is no cynical product. It's an honest expression of the filmmaker's mind - his prurience, his paranoia, his grandiosity and his aspiration. Besson is one of those lucky artists whose genuine impulses are fantastically commercial. No time is wasted. In the movie's first moments, Scarlett Johansson, as Lucy, is forced by her new boyfriend to deliver a locked suitcase to Mr. Jang at a posh Taipei hotel. On the off chance this sounds like a good idea, Besson intercuts this with scenes of fawns being stalked by jungle cats. He further amps up the tension by having the hotel clerk get jittery at the mere mention of Mr. Jang. And then we meet Jang (Min-Sik Choi), a cool customer whose face is splattered with blood.  Leave it to Besson to include the little details that elude other filmmakers. When Jang sits down to question Lucy - first stepping over a dead body - the cuffs of his white shirt are wet and pink, a mix of water and his victim's blood. I've been watching gangster movies all my life and never once had to ponder where mob bosses get their shirts cleaned. Clearly, Lucy, who is stupid to begin with and then stupid and terrified, is in way over her head. The science fiction aspect of Lucy involves a brand-new illicit drug about to hit the international market. Through circumstances best discovered in the moment, some of that drug starts seeping into Lucy's system, resulting in a profound expansion of her abilities. At first, she's walking up the walls and onto the ceiling like Fred Astaire in Royal Wedding, but soon she becomes focused. When she does, she finds that she is not merely intelligent. She is a lethal genius. Skillfully, Besson explains Lucy's transformation by cutting back and forth from Lucy to a professor (Morgan Freeman) lecturing on the mind's potential. Apparently, human beings use only 10 percent of their cerebral capacity. Through the drug, Lucy is using more and more of her brain and taking on undreamed-of powers - heightened senses, telekinesis, mind control. Besson invests Lucy with loving energy, simulating Lucy's perceptions and illustrating key points with brief cuts to the jungle, to urban scenes, arts performances, windmills, the Louvre, Rubik's Cube. We see the life force in trees, the waves and auras coming out of people, and a survey of New York City's topography from 2014 all the way back to prehistory. You can scoff at Besson's philosophies and hypotheses, but to do that would miss what's in front of you. Lucy is an impeccably realized vision of Besson's view of things. That's the vision he was responsible to, and that's what he offers the viewer. For Johansson, this is the second film in a row (after Under the Skin) in which she plays a person of otherworldly intelligence, floating along in a daze of doe-eyed equanimity as she passes harsh judgment on her inferiors. It's hard to imagine there will be many more roles like this, but it has made for an interesting 2014. Johansson deserves some kind of credit for somehow not looking ridiculous.  As for Besson, he deserves acknowledgment as a French filmmaker who knows how to make American-style high-concept action movies better than most of his American counterparts. He never slows down, never falls in love with sequences at the expense of story, keeps his running times down and always remembers that it's all about emotion.  Besson also has the distinction of being the only European filmmaker who takes as much pleasure in regularly demolishing his own hometown (Paris) as American filmmakers do in taking a wrecking ball to New York and San Francisco. In Lucy, Paris gets another serious work-over. ",1
"Lust, Caution: Drama. Starring Tang Wei and Tony Leung. Directed by Ang Lee. (NC-17. 158 minutes. In Mandarin with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Stylized and visually arresting, with intense sex scenes that earned the film an NC-17 rating, Ang Lee's Lust, Caution is an immersion into another time, place and mentality. This capturing of an era's mentality is what makes the film more than just another exalted period piece. Set in Japanese-occupied China during World War II, the film depicts people whose lives have been infected by a protracted war that permeates every aspect of life and complicates and perverts the simplest of interactions.  Based on the story by Eileen Chang, Lust, Caution, which won the Golden Lion at this year's Venice Film Festival, unfolds at a languorous (or cautious) pace, ultimately leaving audiences with a haunted feeling. Though the film does not show combat, it does present, in a gradual and increasingly unsettling way, war's psychological effects. The fact of the occupation is with every character at all times. It's impossible to forget, and eventually that feeling gets inside the audience, too, that uneasy sense of there always being something to worry about, some constraint on expression or behavior. The movie tells the story of an innocent young woman, Chia Chi (Tang Wei), who falls in with a group of politically minded actors. When performing protest plays no longer seems important enough for them, the troupe turns to Resistance work, and Chia Chi goes along for the ride. She turns out to be the most valuable member of the Resistance cell, the prettiest woman and thus the one most likely to seduce and unbalance the Chinese traitor Mr. Yee, who is systematically destroying the Resistance. The perversion of natural impulse begins with Chia Chi's initiation. A virgin assigned to play a seductive married woman whose husband is out of town, Chia Chi submits to having mechanical sex with one of the Resistance members, just to get the hang of what she's going to be doing with the traitor. This is the beginning of war's distortions, and it becomes a running motif - people doing normal human things for twisted or wrong reasons. The whole notion that lust can go hand in hand with caution, that there can be abandon and restraint simultaneously, is disturbing to nature. War poisons everything. As Chia Chi, Wei floats through the movie in a virtual fog of malaise, and Tony Leung, as Mr. Yee, is stern and forbidding, rarely letting the cold mask drop. No one shows all his cards, including Joan Chen, as Mr. Yee's sly, observant wife. As a consequence of all this reserve, some may find Lust, Caution excruciatingly dull, but pay close attention - beneath the surface, behind the mask of either coldness or sadness, there's usually more going on. And everything that's going on explodes to the surface in the sex scenes. We now come to the paragraph that you probably skipped ahead to read, the one that explains why Lust, Caution got an NC-17 rating. The nudity is frontal, and the simulated sex is convincing and protracted. In fact, at several points, Leung and Wei seem to be working through the entire Kama Sutra. But nothing about these scenes is arousing, and they're not meant to be. The director uses the sex scenes rather to document the progress of Mr. Yee's journey, from hostility to relaxation. He uses them to externalize Mr. Yee's inner life, his fear, anger and frustration. You can have a character described as someone with an inability to trust others, but it's even more effective to see him have an orgasm without once closing his eyes.  If war is the death impulse, sex is the life impulse, and Lust, Caution has intelligent, complicated and tantalizingly contradictory things to say about the power of each. Everything else in the film is either very pretty window dressing - or set dressing - or something to inform the mood (the re-creation of wartime Shanghai, the period dress, the hairstyles). In an environment of absolute constraint, sex becomes the most honest form of expression and the most revealing form of conversation. Caution hardly enters into it.-- Advisory: This film contains graphic sex scenes.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"MAX: Drama. Starring John Cusack and Noah Taylor. Directed by Meno Meyjes. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Stated bluntly, that premise might sound simplistic or absurd, but Max is an intelligent film with a sophisticated understanding of art and the significance it played in Hitler's psychology. Here and there, the movie may briefly flag, but it's carried by strong and highly contrasted performances by Noah Taylor as the repellent young Hitler and John Cusack as the suave and good-humored art dealer Max Rothman. The balancing act that the film achieves is embodied by Taylor, who makes Hitler appropriately creepy and humorless, a truly lousy creature to look at, while at the same time making clear that he still, at this stage, had the chance to become something resembling a human being. We find ourselves rooting for Hitler to become an artist, not only for what it will mean to history, but, curiously, for what it will mean to him. The French say that to know all is to forgive all, but in working its persuasive power Max shows that sometimes knowing all can get us bogged down in the less important details. Max can be seen as a fantasy about what might have happened had someone sane gotten to Hitler at a crucial time. Thus we find Max, a fictional Jewish character with a set of traits fashioned to guarantee that Hitler would want to talk to him. As an art dealer, Max is capable of fulfilling Hitler's dreams. As a war veteran who lost an arm in combat, Max is someone Hitler would respect. And as a man of impervious high spirits, Max is someone capable of tolerating Hitler's less-than congenial personality: You're a hard man to like, Hitler, but I'm going to try. In a scene that miraculously doesn't evolve into a Saturday Night Live sketch, Max takes Hitler on a double date, during which Hitler harangues Max's mistress (Leelee Sobieski) and her friend about the importance of having pure blood. Dryly, Max tells the women, Hitler is very concerned with blood. We think -- we hope -- it's a metaphor. As a fellow veteran, Max sympathizes with Hitler (He had a bad war) and sees him as a potentially talented but blocked artist. He tells him that anti- Semitism and paranoid politics are rubbish: It will hold you back. The disillusionment of World War I is fueling a cynical, despairing, angry vision that's transforming the visual arts, but Hitler can't tap that energy because he can't admit that the war was senseless. Still, the movie leads us to suspect, with Max, that Hitler's obsessiveness, anger and drive are indicative of some kind of artistic promise. This is where Max becomes most fascinating and potentially controversial. Ultimately, Hitler fashions an art that Max recognizes as genuine, a kind of ludicrous but passionate modernism with echoes of heroic myth. In a sense, Max is emblematic of the deluded intellectual who can see art but can't see a threat when he's looking straight at it. Yet how could anyone look at the dirty, homely 30-year-old Hitler and imagine that at 44 he'd become the scourge and terror of his country? As Hitler, Taylor has scenes in which he addresses small crowds, and again, in retrospect, it's hard to imagine how director Menno Meyjes kept them from seeming like Chaplin in The Great Dictator. Credit Taylor, who shows Hitler to be desperate, on fire, more than half mad but, however clumsy, clearly on his way. To accomplish this, Taylor mimics the historical Hitler, while injecting notes of gaucheness. The scenes are chilling. For Cusack, Max represents nothing less than the assurance of a prosperous middle age. At 36, this is the first time Cusack has ever seemed incontestably adult onscreen, and maturity suits him. His breezy optimism, which was always engaging, now seems more than that, like the mark of philosophy. He's old enough to know better, but gallant enough to pretend. . This film contains graphic violence and sexual situations. ",1
"MUCH ADO ABOUT SOMETHING: Documentary. Starring Mike Rubbo. Directed and narrated by Mike Rubbo. (Not rated. 105 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Rubbo, who narrates and appears on camera, divides his movie into two sections. In the first he entertains the reasons Shakespeare's authorship is in doubt. The points he raises are not trivial. Contrary to what people have read for years in the introduction to their Folger Shakespeare volumes, the case against Shakespeare is fairly convincing. There's no evidence, for example, that the Stratford public school was of any quality; nor is there evidence that Shakespeare attended it. The few signatures he left behind are shaky enough to make one at least wonder if he was, in fact, illiterate. In one detail that's so ridiculous it's funny, there's evidence to suggest that after Shakespeare's death, the statue erected by his tomb depicted a man holding a bag of grain, indicative of a grain merchant, not a writer. If so, that statue was subsequently doctored to show Shakespeare writing on a pillow. A pillow? Who writes on a pillow? At a time when owning a book was a big deal, the movie demonstrates that Shakespeare's will makes no mention of any books at all, though he practically itemizes the divvying up of his other effects, including his second best bed,  which he left to his wife. The will also makes no mention of his London stage career, except in an emendation that seems to have been added after the fact -- in another case of doctoring, perhaps. Meanwhile, the legal record suggests a nouveau-riche jerk with a passionate interest in suing people, a picture somewhat at odds with the personality that emerges in the plays and poems. After laying out these and many other examples of why Shakespeare might not have written the plays, Rubbo then turns to one possible alternative candidate -- Christopher Marlowe. An exact contemporary of Shakespeare's, Marlowe was the author of Dr. Faustus, The Jew of Malta and other classics. His career was cut short when he was killed in a tavern in 1593, at age 29. But was he? A whole Marlowe cult believes that he lived, that his death was faked and that he spent the next few decades cranking out plays under the Shakespeare pseudonym. Rubbo interviews these Marlovians, who are both eccentric and vehement and rather sweet and believing. They're willing to ignore the obvious -- that Shakespeare's and Marlowe's writing styles were completely different. If there's a weakness to Much Ado, it's that Rubbo concentrates on the Marlovians, who represent a small fringe of the anti-Stratfordian movement. By common consensus, a more likely alternative to the Stratford man is Edward De Vere, the 17th earl of Oxford. But Rubbo gives Oxford short shrift. Even when he interviews Mark Rylance, the artistic director of London's Globe Theatre, he fails to mention that Rylance is an Oxfordian. ",1
"MURDEROUS MAIDS: Drama. Starring Sylvie Testud and Julie-Marie Parmentier. Directed by Jean-Pierre Denis. (Not rated. 94 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Castro Theatre.) The story makes for an absorbing drama that builds in intensity, heading toward the ultimate outburst with a grim sense of inevitability. Director Jean- Pierre Denis strikes the right balance, striving to understand the Lapins, not endorse them. In the process, he guides a newcomer named Sylvie Testud to a performance that's positively hair-raising. Testud plays Christine, the older, crazier and more dominant of the Lapins, who starts the movie in a convent school dreaming of becoming a nun and ends up a raving murderess with nothing to look forward to but life in a rubber room. Testud nails every stage in that psychological journey. Part mad dog and part great spirit, Testud plays Christine as someone who has no business wearing a severe hairstyle, much less a prim maid's uniform. Even in repose, Testud looks as though she wants to claw her way out of her skin. A woman of fierce hostility, Christine has only one fierce love, her sister, Lea, played by Julie-Marie Parmentier, who's also impressive. The fact that Lea is something of a happy-go-lucky simpleton just makes things more interesting, pointing up the contrast between the women and further emphasizing the limits of Christine's existence. That Lea also has a temper that can erupt into flailing destructiveness suggests that this anger- management problem might be genetic. The story of the Lapins has been dramatized before, most famously by French playwright Jean Genet, whose play The Maids emphasized the story's class- struggle aspect. Denis, who co-wrote the screenplay, is less interested in creating a polemic than in nailing down the emotional truth. Yet one comes away with a suffocating sense of what servitude must have been like for these women. It was no Remains of the Day. In Murderous Maids, it's just bad breaks all the way for Christine. Her selfish mother won't let her become a nun and instead puts her to work at a young age. In a series of households, she and later Lea work around the clock but don't earn enough to save any money. There are only two possible escapes, prostitution and suicide. It says something that, days after seeing Murderous Maids, the thing that lingers in the mind isn't the horror of the murders but the sad and inescapable nature of the girls' lives. When, after working in separate residences, they finally land a job in the same household, Lea says, We're so lucky. It's painful to hear such guilelessness. The sisters are like a pair of frightened animals huddling together in a storm. This deep closeness gradually takes on a sexual and, later, a pathological edge. Within the four walls of the relationship, it almost makes sense. The filmmaker emphasizes one point over and over: The girls have nothing but each other. Absolutely nothing -- no other interest, no other form of entertainment, no other human connection, no other source of happiness. Denis wisely doesn't blame class issues for the Lapins' act of madness -- Christine may have been heading for a straitjacket all along. But he does suggest that, for someone a little wiggy to begin with, a sure way to go off the deep end completely is to spend every waking hour cleaning up after nasty rich people. ",1
"Madagascar: Animation. Starring Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer. Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath. (PG. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What makes it good is that the story is a kind of parable that suggests some seriousness beneath the surface, even sadness. Within the limits of a film meant for kids, Madagascar is an honest movie. It sets up a premise, about animals escaping from a zoo, and follows through on it, presenting uncomfortable little moments of truth along the way. The humor is not just zaniness. It follows, naturally, from the depiction of creatures under stress -- in this case, a zebra, a lion, a giraffe and a hippopotamus. The zebra (the voice of Chris Rock), with his animal friends, lives in the Central Park Zoo, in a green oasis surrounded by skyscrapers. His best friend, the lion (Ben Stiller), is the zoo's top attraction and basks in the attention of visitors. The lion loves the zoo. Also content, if not quite so ecstatic, are the hippopotamus (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the giraffe (David Schwimmer), who's a hypochondriac. But the zebra is restless. He wants more out of life, and not in the corny way of an animated character in a Disney movie, who might stand there on four legs and sing a song about his yearning soul. No, this is a Dreamworks (Shrek) movie, and so the zebra is matter-of-fact about his situation. He's 10, feels his life is half over, and he's yet to have an adventure. Oddly enough, such straightforward anthropomorphism turns out to be more emotionally effective than the sentimental approach. For all the levity, Madagascar invites the audience to look at a zoo as a kind of jail. The filmmakers waste no time. The zebra breaks out; his friends follow, and next thing they know, they are each in a packing crate and, thanks to some animal rights activists, on their way back to the wild. Again, behind the sight gag of the animals in their respective crates is a touch of seriousness. When the zebra wakes up and finds himself crated, it's a little like the buried-alive scene from The Vanishing. In another animated film, making it to the wild might have been the place to end it, with the sound track cranked and the fade out coming as the animals troop off into the sunset. Not here. In Madagascar, things are just getting started. The zebra is thrilled to be in his natural habitat, while his animal friends want to go home to the zoo, particularly the lion, who is angry and resentful. Along the way, they meet a colony of lemurs, headed by the lemur king (Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G), who is a lovable scoundrel. Before drawing the lemur characters, the animators studied the lemurs at the San Francisco Zoo, and the results are quite comical. The lemurs look like they're wearing fur pajamas and lounge in elaborate, human-like positions. The wild is all about survival, and although Madagascar makes the struggle for survival funny, it doesn't make it any less bleak. The four animals, having been raised in captivity, are confronted by a world in which everybody seems to be eating each other, and it's appalling. The regular meals that made it possible for the lion and the zebra to be best buddies are no longer being carted in by human handlers, and so new tensions develop. One could say people are just like these animals: In good economic times, everybody gets along. In hard times, things fall apart. Madagascar isn't deep and would have no business being deep. But that it keeps one foot in reality is enough to keep us guessing. -- Advisory: Mildly vulgar language, crude humor and some serious themes. ",1
"Making the Wonderful World of 'Oz the Great and Powerful' No one should resist Oz the Great and Powerful out of loyalty to The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion don't even appear in this one, which takes place some 30 years before the 1939 film, back when the Wizard was just getting his start and the Wicked Witches of the East and West still looked really, really good. Here you'll find the 3-D almost as good as Ang Lee's Life of Pi, with the three dimensions in service of a much better story. Screenwriters David Lindsay-Abaire and Mitchell Kapner devise a satisfying history for Oz, supposedly by going back to L. Frank Baum's books. But watching the movie, it becomes pretty clear that they kept the 1939 classic in mind, thought about what might have happened years before and let their imaginations rip. That's why the more you like the Judy Garland film, the more you might appreciate Oz the Great and Powerful. Appreciate. Enjoy. Admire. Be glad to see. Have fun with ... But as for love - well, love will be harder to come by. Oz the Great and Powerful has one flaw that keeps it from lifting off and soaring: It's 130 minutes long, and that's just too much for a fairy tale. The individual scenes are so good that this is less a problem than it might sound, and it's hard to say what exactly should be cut - this is precisely the problem director Sam Raimi must have faced. But taken together, the bulk seems wrong for the form. Everything else deserves praise, and that includes the opening credits sequence, done in black and white, in lettering from the turn of the 20th century, with the camera seeming to be flying toward the credits as a series of walls part and doors open. It's enough to make you start liking 3-D again, and that's just the start. We meet Oz as a young carnival magician in 1905. He's a fraud, an opportunist and a lothario, who is either a decent fellow underneath it all or only looks like one because he's handsome and played by James Franco. Afraid of poverty and a drab existence, he chooses the life of a mountebank, even when it means giving up the woman of his dreams. And then a tornado comes, while he happens to be fleeing Kansas in a hot air balloon, and he ends up in Oz.Oz The Great and Powerful opens in U.S. theaters on March 8, 2013.Oz The Great and Powerful opens in U.S. theaters on March 8, 2013.James Franco, left, and Michelle Williams in a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.James Franco, left, and Michelle Williams in a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows the character China Girl, voiced by Joey King, left, and James Franco, as Oz, in a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows the character China Girl, voiced by Joey King, left, and James Franco, as Oz, in a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.James Franco plays the young Oz and Mila Kunis plays Theodora, who assumes he is a wizard.James Franco plays the young Oz and Mila Kunis plays Theodora, who assumes he is a wizard.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows James Franco, left, and director Sam Raimi on the set of Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows James Franco, left, and director Sam Raimi on the set of Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows James Franco, as Oz, left, and the character Finley, voiced by Zach Braff, are shown in a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.This film image released by Disney Enterprises shows James Franco, as Oz, left, and the character Finley, voiced by Zach Braff, are shown in a scene from Oz the Great and Powerful.Michelle Williams stars as Glinda in Oz the Great and Powerful.Michelle Williams stars as Glinda in Oz the Great and Powerful.James Franco, above, plays the would-be wizard in Oz the Great and Powerful.James Franco, above, plays the would-be wizard in Oz the Great and Powerful.Rachel Weiss in the 2013 film Oz: The Great and Powerful.Rachel Weiss in the 2013 film Oz: The Great and Powerful.Oscar Diggs (James Franco) and the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) travel the Yellow Brick Road on their way to The Emerald City.Oscar Diggs (James Franco) and the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) travel the Yellow Brick Road on their way to The Emerald City. Or he doesn't. Actually, it's possible to look at Oz the Great and Powerful as a dream from which young Oz never wakes up because he's dead - that he's a dreamer more like the girl in Pan's Labyrinth than Dorothy. You might counter this by asking why he dreams of the same place and characters that Dorothy does, but in the construct of this movie these just might be archetypes. Anyway, just a thought, something to play around with after you've seen the movie. Upon landing in Oz, he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis), a vulnerable young woman who is struck by the coincidence that his name is Oz. She assumes he is the wizard, foretold in prophecy, and instantly falls in love with him. Pay attention to how she's dressed - Gary Jones' costume design is more than vivid. It's psychologically astute. If the character's clothes make you feel reassured, that means something. If a character's clothes make you uncomfortable and you don't know why, that means something else. The meeting of Glinda the Good and Oz benefits from the inevitable emotional chemistry of Michelle Williams and Franco; that is, from the combination of her deep-revolving purity and his benevolent wise-guy essence. Any Glinda who'd appreciate Franco must have a fun streak, just as any Oz liked by Williams must have unknown depths. But the most moving element in the film is the character of a porcelain doll, whose legs are broken in an aerial attack by an evil witch. Time stands still in the best way for the scene in which Oz glues the doll's legs back together. It's a perfectly done scene, with animation effects so seamless you forget to appreciate them. Instead you'll get carried away by the delicacy of the images, the sweetness of the moment and the power of the metaphor: Good and gentleness - people's lives - are porcelain, while the world rains down bombs.

"Mamma Mia!: Musical comedy. Starring Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan and Amanda Seyfried. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Here's one big difference between movies and theater: In the theater, if you have an intense scene between a man and a woman and then the woman starts singing The Winner Takes It All, you don't think, Hold it. What does this ABBA song have to do with what they're talking about? And who's the winner in this analogy? And why is Meryl Streep crying? And why isn't Pierce Brosnan interrupting her to ask what this is all about? In the movies, everything is literal. In the theater, you just accept that it's time for a song.  The literalizing tendency of movies makes for more than a couple of awkward passages in Mamma Mia!, the screen adaptation of the hit musical. There are moments that feel odd and insincere in close-up that would have played festive from 40 feet away. But then, each time, the song continues, the chorus joins in and most of the time the problem stops mattering. The point is, Mamma Mia! is fun, the music's terrific and the cast is appealing. There's a Greek Island, a pretty girl, Streep singing and being funny, an amusing situation and two renditions of Dancing Queen. What's not to like? Well, I'll tell you what's not to like: little things, just a few. Things you might not notice in a theater.  First, some background. This is a put-together juke box musical, made up entirely of ABBA songs, about a 20-year-old girl, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), who has been raised by her mother on a Greek Island. She has no idea who her father is, but by the time the movie starts, she has found her mother's diary from 21 years earlier and knows Dad has to be one of three guys: Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) or Harry (Colin Firth). (Mom got around.) From our point of view, it doesn't matter which one is her dad, just so long as he can sing. The day before Sophie is to be married, the three men show up on the island, each one tall, handsome and accomplished, and the fun begins. Mom (Streep) is shocked to see them, has no idea who invited them and doesn't want her daughter to know of her jolly past of sexual abandon. Meanwhile, Sophie just wants to figure out which one of these great guys is her father.A word about chronology. The movie is modern dress. The cars are new. People have cell phones, and they refer to the Internet. So the movie is set in the present. Yet, whenever the people in the movie discuss the past, they seem to be referring to flower power or to the heavy metal of the early 1970s (except in one instance, when someone talks about punk rock). The chronology is off, unless we're to assume that 21 years earlier all the older characters were '60s burnouts or hard rock holdovers, that they were aimless and rootless and already pushing 40. But that doesn't make sense, because in the movie Mom mentions that, when she became pregnant, she thought about returning home to mother. Generally, you don't go home to mother when you're 38. Here's the thing: I think the movie is trying to appeal to the ABBA demographic by making the characters of the ABBA generation. But the truth is, the movie would have had a lot more juice and adult sex appeal had the older characters been cast with age-appropriate actors -that is, people in their early to mid-40s, not in their mid-to-late 50s. As it stands, Colin Firth, 48, looks like a baby in this crowd. One of the big dance numbers features Christine Baranski (as Mom's old friend) repeatedly rejecting the romantic advances of a very young handsome man (Does Your Mother Know?) - a spectacle only slightly less plausible than science fiction.Yet, yet, yet. I'm just doing my job here, mentioning these imperfections on the off chance that one might be a deal breaker for you. They weren't for me. Aside from these quibbles, in fact, the movie is terrific. All right, just one more quibble: Pierce Brosnan can't sing. I don't want to overemphasize this. Just bang your head against the wall and repeat the sentence, Pierce Brosnan can't sing 10 times. You'll understand how I mean this.  But Meryl Streep is a delight, a good singer, a wonderfully spontaneous comedian. (What's all the nonsense about Streep's ironclad technique? She's the most free, impulsive screen actress in the world.) And Seyfried as Sophie is lovely, a long-lost daughter any middle-aged geezer would love to claim, including this one. Plus, the blue sea. Plus, those ABBA songs.  Basically, this isn't a movie. It's a vacation. Go if this sounds like a vacation for you. -- Advisory: Sex talk and the repeated spectacle of a man in excruciating pain (Pierce Brosnan trying to sing).",1
"Man of the Year: Comedy-thriller. Starring Robin Williams, Laura Linney, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Barry Levinson. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) As a viewer, I want satirical carnage or Capraesque optimism, and Man of the Year has neither, though it might have had both. It's also not a credible thriller, though at times it looks close to becoming one. Yet to get really annoyed at the broken promises or unpursued directions of Man of the Year requires ignoring the appealing thing that Levinson does deliver: a genre-less, imaginative riff by an intelligent filmmaker on the state of the country. Levinson also has to be credited for giving Robin Williams a good starring role in a mainstream picture, a role that's funny without being trivial and dramatic without being maudlin. He plays Tom Dobbs, a late-night political comedian along the lines of Jon Stewart, who is encouraged by his fans to run for president. His fans get him on the ballot in 13 states. All together, those states have enough electoral votes to make him president, if he were to run the table and win them all. Dobbs' platform is bland, which is a weakness of the screenplay (and a weakness of the satire, in that the movie's prototypes -- Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher -- would not have bland platforms). The stump speeches consist of little more than mildly liberal platitudes, with jokes thrown in about how bad (and identical) the Democrats and Republicans are. Of course, they're not identical, which is something Dobbs would know. Likewise, a fellow in his position would never run as an independent. He would run for the nomination of one of the major parties, lest he end up pulling a Ralph Nader and helping the candidate he agrees with least. Levinson covers these lapses by making the election a referendum on Dobbs' personality. It's a pleasure, not only for the voters onscreen but for the audience sharing the fantasy, to see a candidate who doesn't look like a propped-up corpse, who behaves spontaneously and actually answers questions: Yes, he did inhale. No, he did not have sex with that woman -- but he wanted to. The movie's best scene is a debate appearance, in which Dobbs breaks with the canned decorum of the proceedings and questions his opponents directly. In the fantasy that is Man of the Year, the election is conducted electronically by a single voting-machine company that has the national contract. (In fact, the presidential election is not a national election, but an amalgam of 50 state elections, all of which choose the voting method independently.) Laura Linney plays a voting-machine company employee who realizes the machines have a glitch. No one listens to her, and as a result of that glitch, Dobbs is falsely elected president. This plot direction strikes me as a weak choice for two reasons: 1) Levinson diminishes the fun fantasy aspect by having Dobbs not be the people's choice; and 2) He dulls the edge of his satire by having the election determined by a random glitch, rather than by a concerted effort to elect a specific candidate. In a sense, Levinson ties two hands behind his back and then counts on coming up with a third hand. Yet he does, sort of. Man of the Year remains an interesting proposition throughout, and a tale well told. The spectacle of a comedian as president gradually seems reasonable, what with all the clowns who get elected to high office, and, occasionally, Levinson slips in a barb: The TV media accept the results and blithely dismiss the wildly divergent exit polls as inaccurate. By the way, the film is narrated by Christopher Walken, who appears at its start in a wheelchair. He is Dobbs' manager, who suffers from smoking-related emphysema and heart trouble, in a tangential plot element that has so little to do with the real story that its presence seems positively loony. This is texture without meaning, an extraneous and irrelevant detail we'd praise in a European film, so why complain if an American does it? -- Advisory: Strong language, lewd humor, drug references and mild violence.

"Margot at the Wedding: Comedy-drama. Starring Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jack Black. Directed by Noah Baumbach. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Writer-director Noah Baumbach likes to cast a wide net. He throws a handful of characters into a situation guaranteed to bring out intense emotions, and then he sees what he can haul in. Because he has a good ear, because he follows the truth wherever he finds it, because he's a genuine artist and because he has no fear of the unpleasant - he likes the unpleasant - his films elude cliche. They're different. They're never less than good, and Margot at the Wedding is his best yet.But Baumbach has one weakness as a filmmaker, which may simply be a byproduct of his process: He has a hard time coming up with endings. His previous film, The Squid and the Whale, ended more or less on an ellipsis, a false moment of realization. Margot at the Wedding is better because at least it doesn't end in vagueness, though there remains a lingering a sense of incompleteness.Here's the thing: Baumbach is not making slice-of-life whimsy. If he were, he could get away with ending his stories at will. Rather, Baumbach is dealing in serious moral and emotional issues. The difficult character of Margot (Nicole Kidman), for example, just by being there raises a host of questions about motherhood, family and a writer's ethics. Raising questions and honestly observing the behavior of his characters are worthy pursuits, but if Baumbach ever wants to go to the next step - to Woody Allen level, to Ingmar Bergman level - he's going to have to go beyond that and become more intellectually rigorous. He's going to have to figure out what he's saying, then say it.In the meantime, Margot at the Wedding is a promising and enjoyable stop on his journey. If The Squid and the Whale had the father character as the movie's fascinating monster, this movie has Margot, who is a successful fiction writer, a faithless wife, a difficult mother and a sister from the blackest depths of hell. She arrives at the old family house to attend the wedding of her sweet and rather hapless sister, Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), to Malcolm (Jack Black), an out-of-work would-be artist-musician. Margot takes one look at him and sizes him up as the kind of loser she and Pauline would have rejected when we were 16.No one in Margot at the Wedding is a movie stereotype. Margot is not evil and isn't aware of her own unbearableness. Instead of realizing that she's making everyone around her miserable, she's under the impression that others are constantly picking on her. She says strange, cruel things to her 12-year-old son - You used to be rounder, more graceful; you're stiff now, so blase - priding herself on her honesty without any clue as to her unconscious motives. Her fiction is her attempt to sort out all the demons she can't face and doesn't even know are there.As for Pauline, she has made nothing but mistakes. She is not presented as a sweet fool, though, but as someone who is intelligent about everything except her own life. And Malcolm, who in another film might have been written off as a joke, is proud and sensitive. He knows that nothing he's done has added up to much, and he's frustrated and embarrassed about it.Black is out of his league playing opposite heavy hitters Kidman and Leigh, and sometimes the strain is obvious. Then again, he's playing a fellow who is out of his league, so it's OK. Kidman is mean and brittle and yet at all times strangely sympathetic. Leigh, Baumbach's wife in real life, is fascinating to behold. The play of emotion on Leigh's face is one of American cinema's glories, and one we don't get to see often enough.One more thing - and if this sounds weird, sorry, but it comes up for anyone who sees a close-up of Kidman followed by one of Leigh. One face is augmented in some way, whether with Botox or lip injections, while the other is a nice, perfectly attractive, perfectly human 45-year-old face. No, this is not a gossip column item, but something important about movies: The normal face is simply the better vehicle for conveying emotion. And because the pressure on actresses in their 40s is fierce, and because no critic will ever say it, I'll just say it here. Leigh's face is wonderful, and she mustn't ever let anyone touch it - ever - except for her husband, and time.-- Advisory: Sexual situations, nudity and strong language.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Married Life: Drama. Starring Chris Cooper, Patricia Clarkson, Pierce Brosnan and Rachel McAdams. Directed by Ira Sachs. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The mysteries of the heart, the tyrannies of lust and the reckless pursuit of happiness all get thrown into a pot in this odd, original picture from writer-director Ira Sachs. It's a drama with elements of black comedy and suspense, European in feeling but American in attitude. Just for fun, it's set in 1949, an era of glamour, of Hitchcock and of husbands even more clueless than they are today.  Lust can be like a disease, and at the start of the film poor Harry (Chris Cooper) has it bad. He tells his suave best friend (Pierce Brosnan) that after decades of marriage he's going to leave his wife (Patricia Clarkson), because he's happy for the first time ever. Then in walks the woman who is making him happy, young Kay, played by Rachel McAdams, almost unrecognizable as a Kim Novak-style bleached blonde. The characters all get their due, though in retrospect the one who most lingers in the mind is Harry, a successful businessman who has led an insulated life and is now bursting at the seams. He's a curious character - buttoned-down in manner but clearly in internal turmoil, and he has a mission. He wants to bring the same decisiveness that he brings to his business dealings to settling this crisis in his private life. But he knows nothing about life at all, nothing about other people's motives and nothing even about his own heart. He's the most active character in the story, completely sure of himself and completely wrong about everything. Anyone familiar with Chris Cooper will understand why this is an especially good role for him - someone who's repressed but boiling, sure but wrong, decisive but unseeing. Much of Cooper's career has been spent playing guys like this, men who've never questioned what society told them to be, and so they ultimately find themselves bottled up and tangled up, unable to admit their despair and unable to recognize the source of their anger. Though sympathetic, such men are a danger to themselves and others.  As the wife, Clarkson has the least defined role, in the sense that it's the least specifically written. But Clarkson herself is so distinct by now, with her mix of ruefulness and good humor, regret and acceptance, that a character emerges. But a more impressive creation is the young lover, in that Sachs devises a 25-year-old woman who conceivably might be attracted to a scowling, middle-aged business executive. He gives her a past, and McAdams inhabits that past. It's a presence in all her interactions and makes the character older than her years. It also enables her to deal as an equal even with a jaded smooth operator like her lover's best friend, played by Brosnan an aging roue, oily yet vulnerable. Married Life has the virtues of suspense, good performances and well-written scenes that are given time to breathe. That's what's entertaining about it. What's most interesting about it - its overall feeling - is harder to describe. Partly as a result of the period setting but mainly because of the movie's entire atmosphere (the compositions, the soundtrack and Brosnan's unobtrusive voice-over narration), there's a quality of distance to the picture, as though we're seeing a case study. Or watching ourselves watch the movie.  It's strange. It's different. It's arresting, and it's definitely intentional. Ira Sachs knew what he wanted to do, and he's a talent worth watching. -- Advisory: This film contains one scene of sexual intimacy.",1
"Maybe you think you had the worst 2016 election night party in America — you know, the one that ended early. But no, that distinction belongs to then-U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, as evidenced in the new documentary “The Final Year,” about foreign policy during President Barack Obama’s last year in office.Power decided that it would be really fun if she invited every woman representing a country in the United Nations, nearly 40 of them. They came, and so did Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state. To top it off, Power even had Gloria Steinem in attendance. After all, if you’re going to celebrate a woman’s cracking the highest and hardest of glass ceilings, who better to have on the couch sitting next to you but one of the premier feminists of the past half century?Think of it: Watching Hillary Clinton’s election with Gloria Steinem. That would be as glorious and appropriate as going out to vote for the first time in 1920 with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony! Except, wait, Stanton and Anthony were both dead in 1920 and never saw the fruition of their life’s work. And so it has always been in American history: Feminism has never been a career path for those looking for instant gratification, or anything close to it.But anyway. There they all are, all these prominent women, gathered around the television, smiling in anticipation. And at first, things are going well. Power gives the thumbs-up to the cameras. But then Florida starts to look a little funny, and then North Carolina. And then there’s an odd smell coming off of Ohio, followed by some very puzzling vibrations in Pennsylvania. Next thing, some dreaded, awful TV person is standing by a blue and red map of Wisconsin and saying unsettling things. And by this time, of course, the room is half empty.The scene emphasizes the essential challenge of “The Final Year” in its quest to find an audience. People who don’t like Obama won’t want to see it, because they won’t want to spend 90 minutes watching Obama and Obama’s administration. And as for people who like Obama . . . well, they might not want to spend 90 minutes getting seriously depressed.Directed by Greg Barker, “The Final Year” was intended as a fly-on-the-wall documentary, in the great tradition of Robert Drew’s John F. Kennedy documentaries, tracing the mechanics of the Obama administration’s Middle East policy. We see Power, Secretary of State John Kerry and deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, among others, working on initiatives with regard to Syria and Iran, while battling the Russian Federation in the United Nations.But that’s not what we’re thinking about as we watch. Rather the experience of this movie is like being transported by film to southern Italy in early A.D. 79, to see a vigorous discussion as to whether to build the new City Hall in Pompeii or Herculaneum. You don’t even wish you could go back and tell them that the volcano next door will soon render the conversation moot. It’s all too depressing, to see these intelligent, concerned public servants while knowing who has since replaced them.Midway through the documentary, a foreign diplomat asks Rhodes if he thinks it’s possible that Donald Trump will get elected president. A smirk forms on Rhodes’ face — the same smirk I felt on my own face many times when I traveled in Europe that year — as he says, no way. Forget it. Never happen. Don’t even think about it.Later, in the immediate aftermath of the election, the normally loquacious Rhodes is asked for a comment, and he literally goes about 30 or 40 seconds, struggling to put two or three words together. Finally, he gives up.So “The Final Year” is that kind of experience. It is, for what it’s worth, a good documentary, though I imagine its true worth and true nature can only be revealed in time. At the starting gate of 2018, we can have no idea how this film will be perceived in 10 years, and maybe we don’t want to know. Then again, maybe we do.",1
"Mean Girls: Comedy. Starring Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Tina Fey and Lacey Chabert. Directed by Mark Waters. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Here, Waters puts together a talented ensemble of young actors and then directs them in a way that emphasizes comic fluidity, flexibility and scale. It's no coincidence or lucky accident of casting that all the supporting performances go right to the edge of absurdity without crossing the line into random zaniness. As in The House of Yes and Freaky Friday, Waters keeps it wild but real, and the result is not only a series of lively scenes but lively close-ups: The big-eyed, expressive performances are just fun to watch. It could have been generic. Lindsay Lohan plays Cady, who moves with her former hippie parents from Africa to Illinois, having been home-schooled all her life. She immediately falls in with two kids from the art crowd, Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and her gay friend, Damian (Daniel Franzese), who are both intelligent and humane. But when the school's reigning social divas, known as the Plastics, take an interest in her, Cady decides, with the encouragement of her arty friends, to hang out with them. Supposedly she's doing it in a spirit of investigation, but she's also being seduced. High school is confusing and treacherous, but it's also training for real life. Spending time with the chief Plastic, Regina (Rachel McAdams), Cady finds herself both hating her and wanting her approval -- a new feeling for her, but actually a common human situation. Rachel McAdams brings glamour and magnetism to Regina, but also the right hint of comic distance. McAdams nails the laugh, for example, when Regina offers up this supposedly damning description of a former boyfriend: All he cares about is school, and his Mom, and his friends. Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfield, as Regina's lieutenants, are also adroit. Seyfield has a great deadpan as the monumentally stupid Karen, and Chabert in the more substantial role of Gretchen -- sly but insecure, a born follower -- shows lots of skill and nuance. Typically in such films, the lead character is the most bland, the normal person who's there to respond to everybody else's eccentricities. That's pretty much the case here, but Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy. Fey's script is full of funny schoolgirl slang (Shut up!) and caustic riffs on various high school types -- the long-suffering principal (Tim Meadows), the obtuse jocks and, best of all, the hygiene teacher, who keeps telling the kids that if they have sex, they'll die. Fey also includes that rare specimen, the cool teacher, and assigns that role to herself. She plays it well, with the amused, rueful aura many of the best high school teachers have -- an aura that comes of being young and thought old and of being lost and thought wise. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations.

"Melinda and Melinda: Comedy. Starring Radha Mitchell, Will Ferrell, Amanda Peet, Chloe Sevigny and Wallace Shawn. Directed by Woody Allen. (PG-13. 99 minutes.At Bay Area theaters.) Four people, two of them playwrights, are sitting in a cafe in Manhattan. Max (Larry Pine), who specializes in drama, sees life as essentially meaningful. His friend, comic playwright Sy (Wallace Shawn), sees life as essentially absurd. As an exercise, a companion gives them a simple story setup: Young Manhattanites in the midst of a dinner party are interrupted by the sudden appearance of a woman, Melinda, on their doorstep. Is this the beginning of a comedy or a tragedy? Each playwright starts riffing, and what result are two separate stories. The movie depicts these stories, cutting at will from one to another, usually without bothering to tell us which Melinda story we're looking at. We just have to catch up, which is fine, because the film makes it a pleasure to be thrown off balance. Each Melinda story has a completely different cast, except for Radha Mitchell, who plays Melinda in both stories. In the drama, she has curly hair and smokes and drinks heavily, while in the comedy she's more wholesome, has flat hair and looks five years younger. In both, she is newly sprung from a bad relationship, and her friends are trying to pair her off with another man. Melinda and Melinda is a peek into a great comedy writer's bag of tricks. At one point, in the comic story, an actor, Hobie (Will Ferrell), finds himself in a miserable position, one not unlike that of the protagonist in Allen's Play It Again, Sam. He's about to be divorced. He's in love with Melinda, but she has a new boyfriend and seems intent on fixing him up with other women. From here, Allen cuts to the comic playwright Sy, who exults that all the elements for comedy are in place: Our hero is desperate, love-crazed and unhappy. One doesn't immediately think of these as comic elements, but of course he's right. In an ideal world, the Melinda comedy would have been hysterically funny and the Melinda drama would have been devastatingly tragic. Neither is the case, and that weakness keeps Melinda and Melinda in the second tier of Allen films. To be sure, the film is a lot better than a mere intellectual exercise, but just imagine the impact it might have had if the Melinda stories were farther apart in tone and as effective as the best comedies and dramas can be. Or would that have been too much? After all, who wants another straight, sober drama from Woody Allen, even if it only constitutes half the movie? Obviously, this speculation can lead nowhere, but one thing is undeniable: The conclusion of the dramatic story line is almost entirely without emotional force. It's interesting but should have been more than that. Not surprisingly, the comedy is more satisfying. The actors -- among them Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloe Sevigny -- talk like people in a Woody Allen movie; that is, like unrehearsed actors flung before the cameras, with only the memory of other Allen movies to guide them. The artificiality is familiar, though, almost comforting. Mitchell, however, transcends this and delivers two interesting performances -- as a classic Allen neurotic in the dramatic portion and as a radiant romantic actress in the comedy section. As a love-besotted actor -- whose artistry is limited to playing every role with a limp -- Will Ferrell has the role Allen would have played if he were younger. It may shock people who think of Ferrell as a sledgehammer physical comic, but he turns out to be the best and least self-conscious Allen substitute since John Cusack in Bullets Over Broadway. -- Advisory: Sexual situations and some substance abuse.

"Michael Clayton: Drama. Starring George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, Sydney Pollack and Tom Wilkinson. Directed by Tony Gilroy. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) George Clooney constitutes at least half of what makes Michael Clayton worth seeing. The film, a moody suspense drama, has a slow build and a strong payoff, but Clooney is the element that holds it together, that provides the mystery and the interest. Some will see Michael Clayton as just a pretty good movie - arguably, that's all it is. But anyone interested in Clooney, now and in the future, will need to see this film because it provides one of the best roles of his career.  Just about everything Clooney does onscreen, he gets to do in Michael Clayton, and then he gets to do some things that he hasn't done before. His seen-it-all ironic quality is just right for the title character, who is a fixer for a high-powered law firm. Michael Clayton is a lawyer who doesn't try cases but specializes in solving the firm's dirty problems, whether it's smoothing things for a rich client involved in a hit-and-run accident or persuading one of the neurotic partners to get back on his medication.  One of Clooney's more appealing traits as a screen personality is in the way he seems to accept the failings of others. He's never surprised or taken aback, and he doesn't approach anyone from a place of judgment. In Michael Clayton, he's in no position to judge, anyway. He plays a man whose own life is a mess. Clayton may look good in a suit, and no one could fault the haircut. But he has a gambling problem and a failed business on the side, and he owes money to the mob.  Written and directed by Tony Gilroy, the movie is as much a character study as a suspense drama. Stars have meaning, at least the best stars do, and at this point just placing Clooney in a movie suggests something about the individual versus entrenched corruption. Gilroy doesn't have to be explicit and doesn't have to be preachy. Just by casting Clooney, he invites audiences to see the story in terms of its moral and social implications. The story revolves around a pending case in which Clooney's firm - headed by, of course, Sydney Pollack as the top lawyer - is defending an agrochemical company against a class-action suit worth billions of dollars. The agrochemical company is in the wrong, but it's almost guaranteed to win, until one of the law firm's partners (Tom Wilkinson) goes off his medication and, driven by conscience, starts feeding information to the other side. Clayton's job is to talk down the wayward partner, to get him back on his medication and back working for the home team.  Clooney is not alone up there. In their respective scenes with Clooney, Pollack and Wilkinson are top-notch sparring partners - Clooney has to be on his toes, or they'll steal the scenes from him. And Tilda Swinton, as the chief counsel for the agrochemical company, is just outstanding. Though the villain of the piece, she takes viewers into her mental process - her obsession with the bottom line to the exclusion of every other human consideration - and we see the small, terrified person under the hard corporate facade. The scenes of her dressing and rehearsing her presentations are both chilling and pathetic. But it's Clooney's movie. In addition to exploiting everything we already know and like about Clooney, Gilroy comes up with new things for him to do - such as losing his cool, getting nervous and coming up against forces that he can neither charm nor evade. We see Clooney as the father of a young son (a regular kid, not the usual Hollywood brat, played by Austin Williams), urgently offering the boy advice and encouragement. Gilroy even invites audiences to contemplate Clooney's face, as though he were Garbo at the end of Queen Christina, with an endless close-up of him riding in a cab. Until now, Gilroy, a screenwriter, has never directed a movie, and a case could be made that he did not do himself any favors by directing his script this time. The first hour drags a bit, and plot movements could be clearer. Yet I doubt another director would have handed the movie to Clooney in such an overt way, and the result is something valuable: the ultimate showcase for the defining male lead of our time. -- Advisory: Strong language and sex talk.",1
"Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Take This WaltzMichelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Take This WaltzSeth Rogen and Michelle Williams  play a happily married couple threatened by her attraction to another man in Take This Waltz.Seth Rogen and Michelle Williams play a happily married couple threatened by her attraction to another man in Take This Waltz.Drama. Starring Michelle Williams, Luke Kirby and Seth Rogen. Directed by Sarah Polley. (R. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A young married woman - reasonably happy - becomes tempted to cheat on her husband, and not tempted mildly, but tempted as if her soul is screaming, tempted like only Michelle Williams can be tempted, where just breathing in and out becomes torment and ecstasy. What she chooses, and what it means, form the story of Take This Waltz, written and directed by Sarah Polley (Away from Her).  The screenplay is a mix of strong and embarrassing moments, sometimes embarrassing because the actors seem so emotionally naked, and sometimes because the actors must put over an awkward chunk of script. At its worst, Polley's style veers toward the cornball. Yet, in the broad outlines of her story, she has clearly created something with a lot of hard truth. And she has given a role to Williams that showcases the actress' internal qualities, her ability to express inner conflict and passion. After Blue Valentine and My Week With Marilyn, everybody knows that Williams is an extraordinary actress, and yet Take This Waltz still feels like a step forward, not necessarily in her abilities, but in her relationship with her public. This film marks the moment when Williams becomes familiar, not too familiar, but familiar in the way of a movie star, where the audience starts looking at her with understanding and starts looking to her for the expression of certain ideas and emotions.  These ideas and emotions elude precise categorization, but in Williams' case they seem to have something to do with social reticence and fierce desire; with probity and hunger; with an unblinking capacity to see the harsh truth and a pained inability to deny it - even when she'd like to. Williams illuminates for us the seemingly small person who sees herself as an even smaller person, and yet is walking around with volcanoes, earthquakes and tidal waves going on inside her.  The conflict of Margot (Michelle Williams) in Take This Waltz is that she loves her husband (Seth Rogen), but her relationship with him has calcified at a childhood level. Now they can only join as playmates, through shared games and funny voices. So when she meets Daniel (Luke Kirby), he is offering her something that we think she needs just as much as she thinks she needs it, an adult relationship with adult passion. That she wants it is practically evidence that she deserves it. Polley takes almost two hours to chart this woman's emotional course, and Williams is so skilled and so inherently sympathetic that there is not a minute of this journey in which the audience isn't interested in her and caring about her. The actors trace a long arc as well, Rogen from child to man as the husband, Kirby from wry seducer to someone who isn't playing games. Sarah Silverman, in an energetic but amateurish performance, shows up as Williams' alcoholic sister-in-law. There's no believing Silverman, and yet nothing about her makes you wish she'd go away. She's certainly eager enough, too, appearing fully nude with Williams in a women's shower scene. Polley's ultimate point in Take This Waltz is complex and sophisticated and can't be discussed here, not without revealing the ending. Suffice it to say, the issues here are bigger than one woman's story.‌‌",1
"Millennium Mambo Taiwanese Drama. Starring Shu Qi, Jack Kao. Directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien. (Not Rated. 115 minutes. At the Opera Plaza) And it may be a short celebration, as Hou may be the greatest living filmmaker you've never heard of. American distributors have found his films to be too difficult (meaning too difficult to market), but anyone who attended a retrospective of his work at the Asian Art Museum in 2000, or has Netflixed masterpieces such as Flowers of Shanghai and The Puppetmaster, know he's something special. At first glance, with its ultra-hip disco settings and flashy characters, Millennium Mambo seems like a departure for Hou, who is known for period pieces; Flowers of Shanghai, for example, was set at turn of the last century. But this study of a bar hostess (the ravishing Shu Qi) as the millennium turns is well in keeping with Hou's protagonists - generally Taiwanese searching for their identity in a changing society. Carefully made, in Hou's customary rigorous style, Millennium Mambo opens with the bargirl, Vicky, walking down a long walkway in a haze of fluorescent lights. She narrates - but it is not this Vicky that is narrating, but an older, wiser Vicky in the year 2010. With that emotional distance, she tells us the story of 2001. Vicky is trapped in an abusive relationship with Hao-hao, her live-in boyfriend who is directionless and extremely jealous. They both drink and take ecstasy. At her bar, she can cut loose and be herself - whatever her self may be. Desperately looking for a way out, she latches on to a middle-aged gangster (Hou regular Jack Kao), who has a stake in the bar, and who, despite his profession, is a calming influence. Her personal growth amid transience is the heart of the picture. Hou has two crucial allies: His regular cinematographer, the great Lee Ping-bing, and Qi, a Taiwanese-born Hong Kong movie star. Qi is not yet 30, but and she has already made nearly 50 films (only one in English, the action flick The Transporter) and turned in a host of terrific, charismatic performances. This is another one. Hou depicts life-changing events with the careful simplicity of Yasujiro Ozu, a major influence. Political, emotional and gender conflicts take place in the background of daily life - bars and apartments, among families and neighborhoods. Because Flowers of Shanghai is a masterpiece, critics have tended to dismiss Millennium Mambo since its premiere at Cannes in 2001. But look closer, and you will be rewarded by a work of uncommon emotional density. Advisory: This film contains language, mild violence and drug use. - G. Allen Johnson Drama. Directed by Dagur Kari. In Icelandic with English subtitles. (Not Rated. 88 minutes. At the Lumiere.) . To say that Noi is remote and uninterested is to understate the situation. The 17-year-old high school student sleeps in class on the days he decides to show up for school; on the days he doesn't, he sends a tape recorder with a friend, who props the recording device on Noi's desk to provide some semblance of a presence. He can absent-mindedly solve a Rubik's Cube in seconds while talking to a school psychologist, and he takes in stride living with his grandmother while his alcoholic father glides in and out of his life. But mostly, it seems, Noi's biggest problem in Dagur Kari's gently charming and meandering Noi Albinoi is that he lives in the small Icelandic town of Bolungarvik (pop. 957), a place so bleak that there is little hope even if Noi was were living up to his potential. Noi, an albino, is played by Tomas Lemarquis with the kind of blank-faced quirkiness that allows us to identify with him instantly - who among us, after all, has never felt lost? - and his notable failures, which include school and the attempted seduction of the pretty gas station attendant Iris (Elin Hansdottir), stem not so much from incompetence but awkwardness. You're not quite the prince on a white horse, Iris' disapproving dad tells him. Kari is Icelandic and was educated in Denmark, and this is his first feature film, made when he was at the age of 29. That is not surprising; this is very much a young filmmaker's first movie, filled with ambition and heavy- handed symbolism, but lacking complexity. Like his landscape, Noi is frozen; he gets a brief job as a gravedigger (he is practically digging his own grave), and at one point is stuck in the snow, his wheels spinning. But also like a young director with serious aims, there is an earnest tone here that makes Noi Albinoi a success. Who can resist a movie set in a town where the natural history museum, filled with stuffed polar bears and such, is the wildest place in town? Noi Albinoi joins that quirky Icelandic roster that includes Cold Fever and Bjork. Is it something in the water? If so, it's probably frozen. Advisory: Contains scenes of alcohol abuse and mild violence. - G. Allen Johnson 1954 Monster movie. Starring Takashi Shimura and Momoko Kochi. Directed by Ishiro Honda. (Unrated. 98 minutes. In Japanese with English subtitles. At the Castro.) . For five decades, American viewers have been seeing a version of Godzilla that has had little to do with the tone and intent of the original 1954 film, as made and shown in Japan. A new restoration, opening today at the Castro, takes a flawed bit of monster camp and turns it back into a strong, serious-minded and occasionally moving science-fiction film. Gone is everything to do with Raymond Burr, who played a reporter, clumsily edited into the picture for American audiences. Restored are a full 40 minutes of original footage, much of it having to do with the movie's overt anti-nuke message. In the American version, the nuclear angle was an oblique subtext. In the Japanese version, it's the entire point and purpose of the film. Godzilla is a 150-foot creature from the Jurassic Age who has been living on the bottom of the ocean and minding his own business for millions of years. Awakened and uprooted by underground nuclear testing, he starts making a nuisance of himself - first by consuming boats at sea and then by making his way toward land, where he rampages through Japanese cities, chewing up passenger trains and knocking down buildings. In the American version, Godzilla was a freak of nature, an example of really bad luck. But in the Japanese version, he is also a victim. Despite technology that is primitive by modern standards, Godzilla's tears through downtown Tokyo convey more than mere monster malevolence. In the midst of his most destructive moments there often comes a sense of mournful displacement. Godzilla has no idea where he is or what's going on. His home is gone, and he has no place in is the modern world. Such moments go beyond spectacle. Godzilla is a collective metaphor and a collective nightmare, a message film that says more than its message, that captures, with a horrified poetry, the terrors that stomped through the minds of people 50 years ago. These terrors have not gone away, and Godzilla, a classic, is not going away, either. Advisory: This movie contains monster-movie violence. - Mick LaSalle ",1
"Mission: Impossible III: Action. Starring Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan. Directed by J.J. Abrams. (PG-13. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In a way, Cruise is not helped by playing opposite Philip Seymour Hoffman, an actor who makes Cruise's technique look artificial and studied in comparison. But when this fast-paced action thriller turns physical, Cruise closes the deal. His intensity, sometimes unsettling in close-up, is ideal in a fellow running through alleys in Shanghai or dodging missiles or parachuting from a skyscraper. All the awful couch-jumping, placenta-eating publicity that Cruise has received in recent months has the inevitable effect of forcing viewers to see him with fresh eyes. On a second look, what a curious spectacle we've been taking for granted all these years: a taut bundle of calculation, eternally boyish, always aware of what his face is doing, always insisting that we like him, prodding us with smiles and frowns and a sincerity that almost looks real, the ultimate screen creature. Cruise acts as though a performance were a physical act of will, something he can accomplish by muscling his face and emotions into the proper configuration. It's precision work done by bulldozer, and somehow he does it. Cruise seems most at home when there's an explosion or a crash, and he gets to let loose his energy in a big way. He gets all the chance he needs to let loose in Mission: Impossible III, which is a series of elaborate action sequences jammed closely together into one picture. Actually, a lot of modern action movies could be described in that way. What distinguishes Mission: Impossible III is that director and co-writer J.J. Abrams takes pains to ground all this action in real consequences for the characters and the story. It takes craft to make a good action sequence, but it takes a certain artistry to make a story that requires -- and makes sense of -- six or seven action sequences in a row. In the end it's all about setting up circumstances so the audience can care which characters get blown up. If that were easy, everyone would do it. This time out, agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is trying to scale back his hectic life. He's engaged to a nurse (Michelle Monaghan) and has quit active duty to work as a teacher. He hasn't told his fiancee about his line of work -- she thinks he's a transportation specialist. She believes he spends his days at a desk studying traffic patterns, and just happens to be in that kind of physical condition. But she starts catching on when he keeps going away for days and coming back grim, like somebody died ... because somebody died. When a character played by Cruise stops smiling, it sets off alarm bells. Ethan is dragged back into active service when a favorite student he trained (Keri Russell) is kidnapped while investigating the most evil man on the face of the earth. That's the psychopathic, international arms dealer Davian, played by Hoffman, who takes his place among the great dead-eyed, pear-shaped sadists of film history. To rescue her from his clutches, Ethan and his team have to break into a building, steal her from armed guards, retrieve the villains' laptops and jump from the building, preferably as it blows up. In a stunt that has become a staple of the series, Cruise jumps, braced only by a cable, and lands about a foot off the ground. It's possible to get so caught up in the story not to notice, but Cruise does a remarkable number of his own stunts, and even if we only register that fact unconsciously, it makes for a different action experience. The camera is able to stay on Cruise's face as he jumps off a 60-foot wall and lands inches from the ground (yes, he does it twice). In another scene, he jumps off a building and swings from a cable. There's a spectacular sequence on a bridge in which a car explodes and the force of it throws Ethan into another car. That's clearly Cruise being flung and at a nasty velocity. If it were just a matter of showing off, that would be enough, but it's not that alone. However big, these scenes stay personal. Cruise knows how to get an audience on Ethan's side -- and back on his own side. -- Advisory: This film contains intense action sequences. ",1
"Monster House: Animation. Featuring the voices of Steve Buscemi and Maggie Gyllenhaal and introducing Mitchel Musso, Sam Lerner and Spencer Locke. Directed by Gil Kenan. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Usually praising a movie about its new technology makes about as much sense as praising a movie for its old technology. Within a year or two, all technology becomes old technology, and the reasons that a movie is good or bad have a lot to do with how the technology is used and little to do with the technology itself. But this motion-capture process, first seen in The Polar Express, constitutes a creative breakthrough as well as a technological one. Animated films always had the advantage of being able to go anywhere and show anything, to defy the laws of physics and follow the imagination as far as it could go. But they never had the ability to show the human face. There was never any point to a close-up in an animated film -- there was never really anything to see. But with the motion-capture process, real actors give their performances with computer sensors attached to their face and body, and that recorded information becomes the template for the computer animation. If an actor is bug-eyed, the character will look bug-eyed. Moreover, if the actor is thinking or is full of doubt, the technology will be able to render subtle qualities of pensiveness or doubt in the animation. Imagine what Disney might have done with this in the creation of the Seven Dwarfs. Imagine all the things that will be done with this in the future. Monster House looks like the ground floor of something important. The movie itself isn't quite so important, but it's pleasing. The story is about a boy, DJ (Mitchel Musso), who is fixated on the neighbor across the street, Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi), a crotchety crank who raves at kids to get off his property and confiscates every toy or ball that rolls onto his lawn. Like several of the characters in this film, Mr. Nebbercracker has bad teeth. We're all familiar with the perfect gleaming teeth that every animated character has had since the beginning of time, from Speed Racer on up through the cars in Cars. Well, Monster House breaks that convention. In fact, it may break it too much -- it gets a little gross. The motion-capture process is put to good use in the sequence in which DJ's best friend, Chowder (Sam Lerner) comes to visit -- he looks a little like the chubby, earnest Samwise in The Lord of the Rings -- and they play basketball in the driveway. Chowder's uncoordinated movements are funnier as animation than they would have been in live action. Their verisimilitude makes them funny. It's the kick of watching a cartoon look awkward in exactly the same way as a human being. When the ball rolls onto Mr. Nebbercracker's property, the adventure begins. The boys are joined by Jenny (Spencer Locke), a girl who is about their age but several inches taller than they are -- a familiar habit of 12-year-old girls. When the adults prove useless, as they always do, the kids must figure out what's happening and what should be done, as the house gets hungrier and more uncontrollable. At first, its wooden panels stretch and twist into a kind of grimace. Then it starts using its hall runner to snatch up people and pull them inside. Monster House was designed as a family movie and a scary movie. It may scare children, but it won't terrify them. So it's no scarier than it should be. -- Advisory: Mildly scary situations. ",1
"Monster-in-Law: Comedy. Starring Jane Fonda, Jennifer Lopez and Michael Vartan. Directed by Robert Luketic. (PG-13. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Fonda has made comedies before, but in her 15-year absence from the screen, she has become fixed in the public mind as a serious personage -- as a dramatic actress of historical importance, a role model to some and a figure of lingering resentment to others. Monster-in-Law allows Fonda to leave her legend off-screen and yet to benefit from it at the same time. Her skill at knockabout comedy -- her timing, her physicality -- would amuse a visiting Martian. Yet there's no question that knowing who this game old dame is makes it all the more fun. Monster-in-Law does something else smart. It provides Fonda with a role that acknowledges her age, while giving her a series of contexts in which to look like a million bucks. She plays Viola, a TV newswoman and a talk show hostess -- someone with a long, huge career, like Barbara Walters -- whose contract is terminated by network grandees in search of the youth demographic. Minutes after getting her walking papers, she interviews a 17-year-old pop star (a Britney Spears look-alike). She snaps, lunges at her and tries to strangle the girl on camera. This is the kind of humor at work in Monster-in-Law. Not subtle, but effective. Cast opposite Fonda is Jennifer Lopez who, as Charlotte, plays a completely different kind of woman. Instead of one great career, Charlotte has several modest ones, as a dog walker, a waitress and an office temp. She's even-tempered, not controlling; easily pleased and not demanding. She's also physically soft, where Viola is aerobicized. She meets a guy (Michael Vartan) -- one of those handsome guys who always needs a shave but is too indecisive to grow a beard -- and he turns out to be a doctor. When they get serious, he brings her over to meet ... his mother. Most of the movie consists of scenes between Lopez and Fonda, meetings of earth and fire. Excuses are found to throw them together, as Viola -- recovering from a breakdown and intent on managing her son's life -- tries to drive Charlotte away. In one scene, she invites dignitaries from all over the world to her house and goes around introducing Charlotte. (And this is Charlotte. She's a temp.) The strategies escalate as the movie goes along. Much of the comedy of Monster-in-Law derives from knowing what Viola is up to -- she discusses all her plans with her long-suffering personal assistant (Wanda Sykes) -- and seeing how she strains to maintain a veneer of sweetness. The spectacle of that strain and those moments when the mask slips are exploited by Fonda to maximum effect. She's also good at the physical side of the role, not just in the moments of slapstick but in expressing character detail through body language. Viola's breezy and yet grand way of walking, for example, connotes a lot of things at once: Long-term success, genuine magnificence and inner fraudulence. Lopez warms to playing opposite Fonda, as Charlotte gradually loses her deference toward a woman out to destroy her. Charlotte comes into her strength, and there's pleasure in that, a pleasure heightened by the extra pleasure of seeing Fonda and Lopez -- and the kinds of strengths they embody -- presented side by side. The appeal of this can be over-analyzed. Mainly, it's just delightful to see, just as it's delightful that Viola thinks Charlotte is fat. Monster-in-Law is a generational spectacle that's fun to witness. -- Advisory: This movie contains sex talk. ",1
"More than most plays, The Architect would seem to lend itself to big-screen treatment. A major plot point involves a high-rise public housing project that one character campaigns to have demolished because of its dehumanizing effect on residents. In a movie, unlike on the stage, the project can be shown in all its deplorable conditions. But despite graphic scenes of drug- and crime-infested buildings where people are forced to live behind bars like prisoners, The Architect still feels stagebound, inert when it needs to be cinematic. The dialogue lacks the naturalistic ring expected in movies. Characters often sound like they're making speeches instead of just gabbing. Director Matt Tauber adapted David Greig's play, changing the setting from Glasgow to Chicago (the housing project invokes the city's notorious Cabrini-Green, which has been partially torn down) while leaving intact Greig's hard-to-disagree-with humanistic message that everybody deserves a decent place to live. Tauber's long experience directing for the stage is evident, as is, unfortunately, his inexperience as a filmmaker. The Architect is his debut feature, and he moves his actors around as if still working in a limited space. But Tauber's work in the theater obviously taught him how to coax nuanced performances from his cast. The movie is worth seeing just to watch Anthony LaPaglia as Leo -- the architect who designed the project at the start of his now-flourishing career -- interact with Viola Davis as the activist Tonya. She hunts Leo down and entreats him to sign her petition to demolish his own buildings, believing his signature could accomplish the deed. LaPaglia, known mostly for Without a Trace although he's a veteran of stage and film, and Davis, seen in supporting roles in Traffic and Far From Heaven, create tension in their first scene together as each tries to assess the other. The Architect will get you thinking about the extremes of urban life and the responsibilities of architects and planners to close the gap between the rich and poor. Far less thought provoking is Leo's relationship with his emotionally challenged family, which borders on cliche. His wife (Isabella Rossellini) is an obsessive who alternates between staring at neat arrangements of lemons and breaking ceramic pots in the garden in the middle of the night. His daughter (Hayden Panettiere, the cheerleader with weird powers of regeneration on Heroes), is finding herself, and his son is determining his sexuality. They're all so opaque that it's hard to care what becomes of them. Their suburban life is intended to be a bright contrast to the mean streets of Chicago, but neither is very appealing. The Architect is the latest film to de-glamorize that profession. Movies used to make heroes of architects, but they have fallen from the pinnacle of The Fountainhead. Now they are depicted as ordinary beings with the same professional and personal problems as everyone else. -- Advisory: Mild language and sexuality. -- Ruthe Stein 'Ever Again' Documentary. Narrated by Kevin Costner. Directed by Richard Trank. (Not rated. 73 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) Sixty-one years after Adolf Hitler blew his brains out, anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe and the Middle East, according to Ever Again, a persuasive and disturbing new documentary. The picture describes the growing incidence of hate crimes against Jews while uncovering the institutional structures propagating that hate, from radical Islam to the neo-Nazi movement. By far the most dangerous of recent trends is the growing pervasiveness of Muslim fundamentalism, which both inculcates fanaticism and terrorizes moderates into silence. Operating out of mosques in major European cities such as Paris, London and Antwerp, Belgium, radical clerics educate teenage boys with a steady onslaught of misinformation and hatred toward the West. In Belgium, a religious leader calls the 9/11 attacks an act of poetry, an abstraction. Osama Bin Laden is praised as a hero. At an annual conference in England, held every Sept. 11, the 9/11 suicide bombers are called the Magnificent 19. This is exacerbated by the Muslim cable stations, beamed across Europe and streaming online, which feature interviews with angelic-looking children anticipating the glories of martyrdom and commentary by fantasists saying that the Holocaust was the result of a conspiracy between Hitler and the rich Jews (for the purpose of killing poor Jews). On the reasonable side of the ledger, a British government official points out that there's no doubt about the connection between the hate preached (in the mosques) and manifestations of hate actions. The connection between hate speech and hate action is what prompts Tony Blair, in the aftermath of the London Underground bombing, to announce that the government would be deporting non-citizens who meddle in extremism. The movie shows how the extreme language of anti-Semitism is back. While the Nazis referred to Jews as disease-spreading vermin, the new anti-Semites compare Jews to the AIDS virus. Ever Again also documents the resurgence of the Nazi skinhead movement, particularly in Germany, though in comparison to Islamic fundamentalism, the skinheads seem quaint. Featuring interviews with European politicians, an American rabbi and the American lawyer Alan Dershowitz, the movie sometimes crosses the line in equating criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. However, it does show how one can come disguised as the other, and succeeds in making the case that the hatred that seemed dead and buried 60 years ago is alive and growing and beginning to present itself once again as a threat to humane civilization. Advisory: This film depicts some archival footage of violence. -- Mick LaSalle 'Opal Dream' Drama. Directed by Peter Cattaneo.

This fragile Australian offering, about a girl who brings grief to her family by insisting on the reality of two imaginary friends, isn't for cynics. Set in a hardscrabble opal-mining town, the film examines the pressures on the dreamy girl's struggling family in a community that has little use for the impractical. The father (Vince Colosimo) digs and digs but can't make a strike. Perhaps in his own way he's as much of a daydreamer as his daughter (Sapphire Boyce), a bright loner who spends much of her time with Pobby and Dingan, her invisible pals. The mother (Jacqueline McKenzie) barely supports the family by working as a store clerk, while the girl's older brother (Christian Byers) has his hands full at school, where he pays a price for his sibling's odd behavior. The girl's family is sick and tired of Pobby and Dingan, but out of kindness and a sense that the child needs this fantasy, they reluctantly indulge her. The result is trouble. One day the girl declares that Pobby and Dingan have disappeared, and the dad, pretending to search for them, accidentally wanders onto the land of a hotheaded fellow miner. This is a serious breach that gets him labeled a ratter (claim-jumper), and he and the family are shunned by the town. Moreover, the girl comes down with a mysterious and debilitating ailment. The story is sentimental -- and peevish types will be all the more put out that the ending is hopeful. Thanks to creative thinking on the brother's part, the girl finds some closure regarding Pobby and Dingan and the family is reconciled to the town. It's tear-jerker material but ends up being quite touching, and it's a good choice for family viewing. Based on a novella by Ben Rice, the film was directed with a minimum of bells and whistles by Peter Cattaneo of The Full Monty. The acting is earnest. Incidentally, the harsh landscape near the real-life opal-mining town of Coober Pedy, where this film is set, has also been the backdrop for several other movies, including Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, Until the End of the World and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. -- Walter Addiego 'Coffee Date' Comedy. Starring Wilson Cruz, Jonathan Silverman, Sally Kirkland. Written and directed by Stewart Wade. (Not rated. 94 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) The new candy-colored indie comedy Coffee Date is the Three's Company episode ABC censors would never have green-lighted -- a straight guy dating a gay guy as a joke, and thus convincing everyone he's gay no matter how much he denies it. Even the fellow's mother (Sally Kirkland) seems to be channeling Audra Lindley's Mrs. Roper. Chrissy!?! Writer-director Stewart Wade's plot is indeed sitcom thin -- unabashedly so (it is, after all, padded out from a short film). Todd (Jonathan Bray) is set up on a blind date with Kelly (Wilson Cruz) as a joke by his roommate-brother, Barry (Jonathan Silverman). Todd obviously thought Kelly was a woman, but when they discover they have a mutual interest in movies, they actually proceed with their coffee date. To play a joke on bro, Todd and Kelly come back to the apartment and pretend they've hit it off. Freaked out, Barry moves out and alerts mom, who flies in to L.A. in a panic. Todd's joke backfires, because as he and Kelly become movie buddies, he can't convince anyone -- mom, brother, co-workers -- that he's really not gay. Hilarity ensues. As when, to prove his manhood to himself, he picks up a woman at a bar, takes her back to his apartment, and can't perform. Is this gay stuff getting to him? Coffee Date is a likable, extremely goofy piece of fluff that, in the words of Kelly, might show up on your Gaydar. -- Advisory: Sexual situations, language. -- G. Allen Johnson 'Train Man' Romantic comedy. Starring Takayuki Yamada, Miki Nakatani. Directed by Shosuke Murakami. In Japanese with English subtitles. (Not rated. 101 minutes. At the Four Star.) Train Man is the translation from the original Japanese title Densha Otoko, and the hero's name is Otaku, which is roughly translated as geek. How the geek becomes a man is essentially the sappy story of this romantic comedy that supposedly is based on a true story, a tale of male maturation that in its home country became an Internet phenomenon, a best-selling manga and, finally, this film, which took in a whopping $35 million last year. If nothing else, this breezily entertaining fable ups the ante on depicting modern communication. I haven't seen a film that has more characters online or on a cell phone or both. In fact, chat-room messages are texted right onto the screen, sometimes narrated in voiceover, with such frequency that a real person saying something in his real voice to another real person can be startling. The main character (Takayuki Yamada), whose chat-room moniker is Train_man (and that's how we know him), begins his path out of geekdom by saving, quite by accident, a pretty woman from a drunk, groping man on the subway. After giving their reports at the police station, they exchange digits and the grateful woman, Hermess (Miki Nakatani), sends him a gift. With the help of his chat group -- none of whom he's ever met, of course -- he works up the courage to ask her out to dinner, and she accepts. Happily ever after, right? Not when you're the geekiest guy in the world, a champion fumbler/bumbler who has zero confidence in himself. Displaying heroic tolerance and patience, Hermess -- who is young, beautiful, unattached and apparently without any hobbies -- coaches Train Man into manhood. Japanese women and Internet geeks alike love Train Man and his touchy-feely persona, rare for a Japanese male screen hero. And Yamada and Nakatani are indeed likable. Director Shosuke Murakami efficiently packages the material, deftly weaving in the individual stories of Train Man's chat-room buddies and how his success also gives them courage. It turns out one lonely woman and one lonely man in the chat group are married to each other, neither aware of the other's presence in the ether. When they realize they are both in the chat group and are breathlessly following Train Man's exploits, the marriage is miraculously rebooted. -- G. Allen Johnson ",1
"Mr. Brooks: Crime thriller. Starring Kevin Costner, Demi Moore and Dane Cook. Directed by Bruce A. Evans. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In Mr. Brooks, serial killing is likened to alcoholism or any other form of addiction. Brooks, a wealthy entrepreneur, is an otherwise reasonable man in the grip of something that is twisted into his very nature. He can stop, sometimes for years at a time, but he keeps relapsing. Writer-director Bruce A. Evans impishly presents Brooks' struggle with himself through an ongoing conversation between Brooks and an invisible alter ego. This spirit of menace and mayhem is played by William Hurt, who keeps whispering in his ear, egging him on, talking about how fun it will be. Partly by the casting of Costner and partly by the treatment of his compulsion, the movie does a number of insidious things. It makes a heartless sociopath into a sympathetic figure. It persuades us to root for him to succeed and not get caught. And worst -- or best -- or most disturbing of all -- it takes his addiction and makes it almost understandable to us. In the movie's first example of violence, he kills two lovers in their bed and almost swoons from the sheer thrill of it -- inviting the audience to have the shame of empathizing with him. With all that going for it, all Evans and co-writer Raynold Gideon have to do is not screw it up, and they don't. They introduce a homicide cop on the case, Demi Moore, and it's a pleasure to see Moore, for the first time in years, in a meaty role that isn't a kind of monster-parody of herself. The detective has been following Mr. Brooks' exploits, but he's meticulous in his work and has never left a clue. Until now. This time he neglected to close the curtains before he killed these people, which leads a young creep to show up in his office with a batch of photos. The creep (Dane Cook) isn't interested in blackmail. He just wants to get off, by accompanying Mr. Brooks on his next homicidal adventure. That's just one plot strain. The movie introduces several, juggling them expertly and making them all come together at the finish. The screenplay may be a bit programmatic, a bit too neat, a bit too much like craft and too little like inspiration, but it's a polished job, and it entertains, and I'll take it. I'm happy. Danielle Panabaker has a nice role as Mr. Brooks' daughter, who may have inherited more from dad than just good looks. And Yasmine Delawari makes a surprisingly vivid impression in a modest role, as Mr. Brooks' secretary. But there's more to be said. The audience takes something from this picture. Maybe it was intended, and maybe it wasn't. Perhaps Mr. Brooks simply caught the spirit of the era, but in any case, the film emerges as a subtle commentary on a disquieting aspect of our current culture -- a commentary on the nature of a masturbatory voyeurism and how it fosters heartlessness by turning other people into objects. When Mr. Brooks and the other perverse characters in the film are aroused, they have to forget the humanity of others in order to achieve satisfaction. If they remember that other people are people, they'll lose the impulse. The relevance of this message to the society at large and not just to the characters is obvious, in that we live in a voyeuristic culture, in which both entertainment and commerce trade on instant and impersonal arousal. I suspect that 50 or 60 years ago, this film would have made absolutely no sense to people. But today we can see in the cold world of Mr. Brooks the coldness of our own world. And we can look at Mr. Brooks for minutes at a time and forget that he's a villain, or simply not care. If this says something, it's not something good. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, nudity, strong language and graphic violence. ",1
"Munich: Drama. Starring Eric Bana, Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (R. 167 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet everything that keeps it from being lovable could be looked upon as a virtue, and everything about it is intentional. Moreover, the episodes, in and of themselves, are compelling, and though the movie runs 167 minutes, it never drags. It ends precisely as it should end, with an extended shot that says more with one image than ever could have been said with dialogue. In the Spielberg filmography, Munich may go down as something along the order of Hitchcock's Topaz, another chilly, well-made, historically based suspense drama, made as a response to the madness of the world situation. Spielberg's film deals with the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics, in which 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists. A Mossad agent, Avner (Bana), is given a budget, a staff and instructions to track down and assassinate every Arab terrorist involved in the Munich attack, and we follow him and his associates as they go around Europe killing people. The film's episodic structure derives from the nature of Avner's assignment. At each juncture, he gets a name and a location, plans a killing and carries it out. At first, this begins to seem like a grim version of the old Chorus Line structure, in which the story can move only laterally, from dancer to dancer, or in this case, from corpse to corpse. While technically suspenseful, these scenes lack any galvanizing emotion, since Spielberg and screenwriters Tony Kushner and Eric Roth have no stomach for Avner's mission. People will argue whether this is politically wrong, right or just confused, but there's no arguing about the effect of ambivalence on drama. It weakens it. Yet gradually Spielberg's strategy emerges. He depicts an endless maze of tension and violence and makes it feel suffocating by placing the viewer in the midst of it. Spielberg couldn't care less about the mission the men are on, but he cares about what the mission is doing to them. Thus, we get scenes of them arguing the moral points of revenge and assassination, as a shorthand way of establishing and tracking the changes in their personalities. Daniel Craig (the next James Bond) plays an instinctive man, not plagued by conscience, a natural soldier; Ciaran Hinds, an intellectual doubter; Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), a sensitive artist disguised as a bomb maker; and Hanns Zischler, a seemingly emotionless killer, whose facade cracks after a particularly pathetic episode involving the shooting of a frivolous female assassin. The conversations between Avner and his men seem schematic, done more for our benefit than theirs. For all the screenwriters' straining, the only character to emerge with any complexity is Avner himself. His confusion is Spielberg's confusion. It's the civilized person's confusion. Should he take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth to the point where no one has any eyes or teeth? If not, what's the alternative in combating terrorists? Doing nothing? In a truthful and decidedly non-movie star way -- Bana traces the progress of a man from assurance to doubt, from an easy conscience to haunted dreams, from someone with the glint of youth and enthusiasm in his eyes to one who can see only death. The future will pronounce on Munich in a way that it will not pronounce on Rumor Has It or any of the other movies opening this holiday weekend. No one will remember the others, but Munich will be looked to as a popular document from early in America's terrorism struggle. Future events are sure to determine the film's ultimate meaning, but in assessing its ultimate importance and value, it would be a mistake for any present or future critic to denigrate Munich for its philosophical inconsistency, its muddled politics or its mix of impulses. Like Heroes for Sale, a 1933 film made in the heart of the Depression that was all over the map ideologically, Munich captures the bewilderment of its historical moment. It's an emotional film disguised as a thoughtful film, an artfully executed wail of frustration. As such, it's the most complete post-Sept. 11 time capsule since Spike Lee's 25th Hour. One final note: Spielberg begins the film with excerpts from ABC's original live coverage of the Munich slayings. I had a childhood recollection that Jim McKay, known as a sports announcer, did an exceptional job anchoring those broadcasts. It's nice to have that memory confirmed. -- Advisory: Lots of strong language, nudity and violence -- sometimes in the same scene. ",1
"Music and Lyrics: Romance. Starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. Directed by Marc Lawrence. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to SFGate.com/movies.) Notice this in Music and Lyrics -- and along the way notice and appreciate the way that Grant has become one of our best movie stars of the old style, someone who brings a consistent personality to film. The promise of a Hugh Grant movie is something quite specific: It will be something about a blithe, loosely moral but not conscience-free fellow with a smooth line and a way with an offhand quip. It's a measure of Grant's ease and comic precision that it seems like it could only be fun to write dialogue for him. In Music and Lyrics, he's a former '80s pop idol, and the beginning of the picture features him in a mock-vintage rock video that captures the corny conventions and effects of that era. That mock video makes for an especially clever credits sequence, and by its end, we know the whole backstory of our hero, Alex (Grant). He is a has-been, a performer on the order of the other guy in Wham, the one who wasn't George Michael. But he's relatively jolly about his situation, and he makes a decent living on the nostalgia circuit, singing to his old music tracks and gyrating his stuff for grown women in their 30s. Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame. His career gets a shot at a second act when the teen pop sensation, Cora (Haley Bennett), asks him to submit a song for possible inclusion on her new album. He ends up collaborating -- through circumstances not worth going into (and made too elaborate in the picture) -- with the woman who waters his plants, Sophie (Barrymore). Most of the movie details their emerging working relationship. Writer-director Marc Lawrence makes a talk-heavy variety of romantic comedy that not everyone likes -- Miss Congeniality, Two Weeks Notice, Forces of Nature -- but he does it well. Moreover, Music and Lyrics has virtues its predecessors lack. Scenes play out longer than in most films, and conversations have a chance to evolve. Also, because much of the film places the protagonists in rooms together, working for extended periods, there are an unusual number of two-person scenes, giving the actors the chance to show their charm, work off each other and develop the nuances of interaction. There are lots of songs and singing interludes, more than one might expect -- as in one more and Music and Lyrics might have to be called a musical. The songs serve various functions. Some are meant as examples of throwaway pop, either from the '80s or today, and others are meant to be taken seriously. Whatever the case, the songs, written by Adam Schlesinger, are more than convincing examples. They're catchy and add to the picture's appeal. Neither Grant nor Barrymore is a polished singer, but each can carry a tune. Likewise, though Grant couldn't be mistaken for a dancer, he moves well enough to be believable as a performer. Also worthy of note is newcomer Bennett, who does some interesting things as Cora, the reigning pop diva. She simultaneously suggests someone who has already become too big to be a human being -- a teenager encircled by an entourage, who has become a queen too soon -- yet someone who is probably not a bad kid. Lawrence's take on pop music success is exactly right, satiric without being absurdist, and therefore a prize worth the effort. In a key scene he captures, better than any film of the last couple of years, the atmosphere at a modern rock concert. -- Advisory: Some sexual situations. ",1
"My Best Friend: Comedy. Starring Daniel Auteuil and Dany Boon. Directed by Patrice Leconte. In French with English subtitles. (PG-13. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) My Best Friend is more in Leconte's chamber piece category, the story of an aggressive antiques collector who doesn't quite realize that he is living an entirely friendless existence. He is interested only in things and sees people - not only taxi drivers and service professionals but even his business partner (Julie Gayet) - as means to an end. And then one day, as if intuiting this lack within himself while lacking the means to address it, he pays an exorbitant sum of money for an antique vase celebrating the friendship between two men. The purchase leads some of his associates to observe that he has no friends, not one in the world. He insists that he has, that indeed he has a best friend, and with this the plot mechanics kick into gear. A wager is made. His partner goads him into agreeing to forfeit the vase if he can't produce a best friend by the end of the month. Francois, the antiques dealer, is played by Daniel Auteuil, as another in Auteuil's gallery of difficult, driven, self-deluded and yet fundamentally decent men. Auteuil's smile - a frozen social contrivance invariably betrayed by his doubting eyes - can be quite funny, and here it's both funny and affecting, as he tries to enlist people into friendship with embarrassing results. Francois is not Ebenezer Scrooge, a man who turned away from love and kindness as a young adult. He seems never to have possessed the gift for friendship, which makes him a more sympathetic figure, as well as a more curious and amusing one. Francois takes notice of a cabdriver, Bruno (Dany Boon), who seems to have a way with people, and Francois hires him so that he can learn how to be likable. As one might expect, this inevitably leads to a series of delightful humiliations, in which Francois tries and fails and keeps failing, but what makes My Best Friend interesting - and what makes this a Leconte film - is that the interactions are not all one way. Neither is every aspect of the interchange between Francois and Bruno easy to calibrate or quantify. People sometimes benefit from being around each other in ways that can't be defined. Along the way, My Best Friend offers insights into the emotional and psychological components of both friendliness and friendship. They're not synonymous, though both have value. Bruno has the gift of friendliness, which has a lot to do with confidence and a genuine interest in people. Friendship, however, is harder to pin down and remains partly a mystery. -- Advisory: Strong language. ",1
"My Blueberry Nights: Romance. Starring Norah Jones, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, David Straitharn and Rachel Weisz. Directed by Wong Kar-wai. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Two important things are going on with Wong Kar-wai, the writer-director of My Blueberry Nights. The first is that his sensibility is wildly romantic - not unrealistic, not maudlin, not pie-in-the-sky, but full of feeling and always valuing human emotion and interaction above anything else. The second is that he's committed to replicating, in visual terms, what it's like to feel passion. So his emotions are huge, but his compulsion to re-create that consciousness is clinical, controlled and incisive. This combination of heat and intellectual distance is Wong Kar-wai in a nutshell. Unlike most American directors, he has not gotten over the human face. There's a scene in which Norah Jones, as a heartsick young woman, is sleeping with her head on a counter, and Jude Law, who runs the local diner, is looking at her. It's the moment he's falling in love, and Wong just leaves the camera on Jones' face, until we, too, start to marvel at it.  Notice I say it, not her. With Wong, you can never forget that you're looking at a face, that is, at flesh and blood, at something temporal. Thus, Wong invites you to fall in love, not with a particular woman, but with love itself and with a specific moment in time. Few directors regularly exploit so well film's capacity for capturing the present and the past in the same instant. Wong is plugged into a special zone that feels that joy of experience and the pain of recollection simultaneously. In My Blueberry Nights we observe with an extra-special intensity because we're observing through the eyes of an outsider. After an early interlude set in New York - where the weather, for some reason, is always cold - the movie becomes the story of Elizabeth (Norah Jones) and her travels. Trying to heal a broken heart and get on with her life, she goes to several small towns and takes waitressing and barmaid jobs. Wherever she goes, she meets people whose confusion and turmoil are even bigger than her own. Singer Norah Jones, in her acting debut, brings an essential probity to the role of a woman coming into her first real understanding of pain. First she experiences the pain herself, and then she sees it in others, sort of the way it sometimes happens that you'll first hear about something and then suddenly notice it's everywhere and always has been. The spectacle of an alcoholic cop (David Straitharn) still helplessly in love with his estranged wife (Rachel Weisz) stuns her into self-reflection. So does the demeanor of a strangely buoyant gambler (Natalie Portman), who swallows her grief and lives from thrill to thrill in Las Vegas.  The movie's overall story is modest, and if it were any longer the film might start to drag. But at 90 minutes, it's short enough to be carried along on the drama of its individual scenes and the strength of its performances. At one point, Wong subjects Weisz to the vicious scrutiny of an extended, emotional monologue in one unbroken close-up. It's the best acting she has ever done. And as for Portman, this is the movie that crystallizes an impression that she is turning into one of our most impish, fun-to-watch actresses. There's a range here that Hollywood has barely started exploring. The nice thing about Wong is that, like a good gambler, he knows when to bet the farm and when to hold back. Most of the time, he plays it straight, and other times he will speed up the action into a kind of blur, to indicate time passing; or he'll fade out and back into the same shot, as though to indicate renewed focus.  Everything he does re-creates a state of mind. It's such a relief to realize he's doing everything for a reason and not to show off. -- Advisory: Mature themes.",1
"Mysterious Skin: Drama. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brady Corbett and Bill Sage. Directed by Gregg Araki. (NC-17. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's about two little boys in small-town Kansas who join a Little League team in 1981. One boy, Neil, becomes the special favorite of the coach (Bill Sage), a cheerful and ostensibly normal guy, whose house is a child magnet, with lots of video games and sugary treats. One day, after setting up Neil for weeks, the coach makes his move -- When I really, really like someone, there's a way I show them how I feel -- and the boy is too confused to quite register this as abuse. He's a lonely kid, and the coach's wholehearted approval is a source of pride. Meanwhile, another teammate, Brian, a sensitive kid with glasses, has suddenly developed an unexplainable set of ailments -- nose bleeds, nightmares, fainting spells and blackouts. He doesn't know the source, but 10 years later, still suffering, he comes to believe that he may have been abducted by space aliens. These two stories, seemingly unrelated, go along on parallel tracks for most of the film. This is a much easier narrative strategy to pull off in a novel than in a movie -- the movie is based on the book by Scott Heim -- but director Gregg Araki keeps both narratives alive and thriving. Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) becomes a gay hustler whose adventures eventually take him to New York. Neil has a cool, impassive way about him, but no one is cooler than New York, and his Big Apple encounters are harrowing. Meanwhile, Brian (Brady Corbet) remains in a somewhat arrested state of development, living at home and drawing pictures of aliens in a sketch pad. Inevitably, the stories come together, powerfully, but the virtues of Mysterious Skin go beyond the moment. The movie lingers in the mind, and there are things in it that only make complete sense upon reflection. There are also unresolved elements that are haunting. This is a serious piece of work that's even better the next day. -- Advisory: Strong language, simulated sex, sex abuse and violent sexual encounters. ",1
"NICHOLAS NICKLEBY: Drama. Starring Charlie Hunnam, Christopher Plummer and Jim Broadbent. Directed by Douglas McGrath. (PG-13. 132 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The revelation of Dickens is always one of emotional involvement. One sits down to watch Nicholas Nickleby expecting the usual staid costume-drama encounter with high art, only to be hit on a gut level by rage and delight. In Nicholas Nickleby, the heroes are very human, while the villains are absolutely disgusting, and yet also human. Dickens shows us just how the villains see themselves. He takes us into their self-delusion, an experience both revealing and revolting. But this is a movie, so perhaps we should be talking about how the filmmaker shows us this and that. The fact that our first impulse is to credit Dickens is a tribute to the faithful and self-effacing work of the director. In fact Douglas McGrath, whose previous literary adaptation was the charming Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow, is all over Nicholas Nickleby. He does more than condense the story. In scene after scene, he realizes it in evocative and witty visual terms. The opening voice-over, in which we meet Nicholas' family, sounds like Dickens, but it's not -- such is McGrath's feel for the material. Nicholas is born into comfortable but unsteady middle-class surroundings, and when their small fortune disappears and the father dies, the family is thrown into poverty. When he's 19, Nicholas, his mother and his sister separate, each to make a living in a harsh 19th century England that we today might call Dickensian. Nicholas takes employment as a teacher at a boys' boarding school, a desolate underpass out of some Victorian version of Trainspotting, replete with biblical passages scrawled graffiti-like on the stone walls. Kids sleep in narrow, straw-filled troughs that look, at first glance, like open coffins. The school is run by Mr. and Mrs. Squeers (Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson), who are a study in self-righteousness and cruelty. Feeding time at the school is a particular sight: Mrs. Squeers violently shoves a wooden spoon into the mouth of each child, saying, Take it -- and thank me for it. In this environment, Nicholas -- played by the capable Charles Hunnam, who's blond and pretty enough to be an elf in The Lord of the Rings -- seems equipped to float above the horror, but Dickens was wise not to make Nicholas completely good. He has a temper, and his willingness to shoot off his mouth when he spots injustice keeps him interesting and keeps scenes volatile. But the Squeers are small fry. The movie's ultimate villain is Nicholas' Uncle Ralph, a banker played by Christopher Plummer as the essence of genteel evil. He brings Nicholas' sister Kate (Romola Garai) into his household and allows an aging rich friend to apply hideous, humiliating sexual pressure on her. As the friend, the usually reserved Edward Fox abandons himself to grotesquery, while Plummer suggests that the uncle is deriving perverse secret satisfaction from the spectacle. In the uncle -- both a twisted soul and the soul of respectability, a powerful public figure of a kind we can recognize -- Nicholas Nickleby gives us someone cathartic to hate. In its last 40 minutes, Nicholas Nickleby begins to get a bit episodic. But by then the audience is hooked and wants to know, for example, what will become of Smike, Nicholas' lame and saintly young companion. Smike is played by Jamie Bell in a way that characterizes all the performances in Nicholas Nickleby -- straightforward, with no pleading for audience understanding or pity. Nathan Lane, as Crummels, lightens the mood. He's the head of a traveling acting troupe who befriends Nicholas and Smike. Lane is ideally suited by virtue of temperament to play one of those figures of joviality and kindness that turn up in Dickens just when things seem impossible. In the movie's one stab at postmodernism, Mrs. Crummels is played by the drag performer Dame Edna Everage, a bit of zany casting that's either a jolly absurdity or is meant to suggest that the Crummels are a gay theatrical couple passing as straight. Either way, it's funny. ",1
"Nanny McPhee: Children's movie. Starring Emma Thompson and Colin Firth. Directed by Kirk Jones. (PG. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In a seemingly blithe way, the movie captures an aspect of child consciousness not usually explored onscreen -- that zone between innocence and knowledge. For the seven children of the widowed Mr. Brown (Colin Firth), life and the ways of adults remain mysteries, but the children can't help but sense that the answers to those mysteries, when they come, might not be satisfying, complete or reassuring after all. Thus, the children are fantastically naughty: throwing food, painting the piano, pretending to eat the infant sibling. Their freneticism and the ways in which they stay together as a pack constitute their effort to stave off adult consciousness, to keep moving and playing so that knowledge can't accidentally sneak in. Mr. Brown, in despair at being unable to retain a nanny for his unruly kids, is surprised one evening by the arrival of Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson), a grave and disconcertingly homely woman with two large moles, a huge nose and a snaggletooth that hangs over her bottom lip. She carries a walking stick that gives her magical powers, so that when the children claim, for example, that they have measles and can't get out of bed, they indeed get measles and become stuck in their beds. Nanny McPhee is a real-life nanny, a supernatural emissary and a walking metaphor. On several occasions, she tells the children, When you need me but don't want me, I'll stay. When you want me but no longer need me, I'll go. It's an enigmatic and arresting statement that, like much in Nanny McPhee, seems to mean much more than is apparent. She is the bridge between a child's fantastic worldview and an adult's sober understanding. She provides a last gasp of magic, as she guides the children toward a grounded footing in the world. All this sounds terribly serious, but the moment-by-moment experience of Nanny McPhee is anything but that. The talented British cast plays it broad and for laughs. With the most affected speech imaginable, Angela Lansbury eats up the scenery as Mr. Brown's aunt, a wealthy stuffed shirt. Derek Jacobi turns up in a minor role as one of Mr. Brown's gossipy and boisterous assistants, and Celia Imrie swings wild as the wicked, vulgar harpy whom Mr. Brown may be forced to marry. Yet an edge of seriousness is always present. The children live in fear of being split up and sent to an orphanage if the family finances don't improve, and death hangs over the movie from its first moments -- the untimely loss of Mrs. Brown is conveyed by a single empty chair. Mr. Brown himself is a mortician, which means that entire conversations take place in his workroom, a different corpse on the slab each time. The presence of the corpses is amusing, honest and macabre, which is an accurate description of the tone director Kirk Jones maintains throughout. Thompson wrote the screenplay, based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, and she gives Nanny McPhee a melancholy awareness. She remains reserved throughout. At the finish, the children may know as much as the adults, but Nanny knows more than the adults, including the adults in the audience. She's not smiling, and she's not telling. -- Advisory: A few corpses. ",1

The movie promises earthquake effects and delivers them. Ten years from now, these effects may be old stuff, but in 2015, you will not find better. And while after about an hour, the sight of buildings exploding and imploding starts to get numbing, the movie stays alive by focusing on the micro-disasters as well, such as what it’s like for a person to be inside a building as it’s pancaking, or to be trapped inside a car in a basement garage right before a cave-in.The earthquakes are the stars of “San Andreas,” and no one pretends otherwise, but there are actual people in the movie, because debris has to fall on somebody. Paul Giamatti, walking a line between drama (on the surface) and comedy (what he’s really thinking), plays a seismologist whose mission is to predict catastrophic earthquakes. At the start, he’s smart enough to forecast the Hoover Dam quake about eight seconds before it happens. Later, he improves his method to the point that he can issue televised warnings: “I cannot emphasize this enough to the people of San Francisco. You need to get out — now!”Of course, the safest route out is to the north, over the Golden Gate Bridge ... uh-oh.Giamatti is the man of intellect. Dwayne Johnson plays the man of action, a rescue pilot who, at the start of the movie, has the same family difficulty that Liam Neeson had at the start of “Taken.” His workaholism has wrecked his marriage, and now his wife (Carla Gugino) and loving daughter (Alexandra Daddario) are living in the Los Angeles mansion of a rich guy. Money usually means security. But when you’re on the roof of a building that’s collapsing, it’s better to know somebody who flies a helicopter.Though no one will ever confuse him with Olivier, Johnson is ideal in this kind of movie — huge enough to compete with the special effects, and with an aura of doggedness and competence that makes you believe he’d never give up. For most of the action, Johnson and Gugino, playing ex-spouses, travel across California to find their teenage daughter, and their relationship is convincing and nicely built. Johnson is the kind of actor who needs a mission. Tell him his character’s purpose is to save his family, and that’s what he plays — every second he’s onscreen. There’s not much nuance there, but it’s a form of good acting. If anything, the young people are even better — Daddario as the capable daughter, a chip off the old Rock; and Hugo Johnstone-Burt as the lucky young Englishman who will soon be her boyfriend, if they can both survive the next 24 hours.Hoover Dam is the hors d’oeuvre; Los Angeles is the appetizer, and San Francisco is the main course. The places in between are light snacks, occasioning the odd remark. (She: “Where are we?” He: “Bakersfield. Or what’s left of it.”) Say goodbye to the Hollywood sign. The Transamerica Pyramid is now the Transamerica Stump. The Bay Bridge finally gets its close-up, and AT&T Park will soon have to adopt new rules. For example, if the baseball drops through a crevice and falls to the center of the Earth, that’s a ground-rule double. By turns frightening, exciting and ridiculous, “San Andreas” is, in the end, more impressive than anything else. We take for granted that a movie can show a tsunami, but when filmmakers come up with ways to make that tsunami particularly vivid and horrifying, that’s something else. (And isn’t it nice that San Franciscans can have the Venice experience without flying to Italy?) Likewise, a helicopter roof rescue is all well and good, but how about one from a low building, while taller buildings are collapsing all around it? Some movies are easy to mock, but hard to resist. This is one of them. And as much as a barbecue by the pool, with the ballgame playing on the radio, “San Andreas” has the feeling of summer. ",1
"Newlywed Matthew McConaughey ratchets up the creep factor as a Dallas cop-turned-contract killer in this modern-day black comedy Killer Joe, and we're going behind the scenes! It is a character like I haven't really done before, says Matthew. It's pretSouthern gothic comedy-drama. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Thomas Haden Church, Emile Hirsch, Gina Gershon and Juno Temple. Directed by William Friedkin. (NC-17. 103 minutes.) The hardest thing to describe is tone, but it's the thing that most sets Killer Joe apart and makes it one of the most interesting and satisfying movies of the year so far. It is a tale of white trash immorality on a grand scale, of people who are ridiculous and yet dangerous, laughable but cunning, and really stupid ... yet sneaky. So the movie lands in an original zone in which the violence is real and the events are shocking and unexpected, but there's a distance there - the distance that allows for laughs. The distance is also present in the performances. Matthew McConaughey plays a paid killer, and he has an eerie stillness about him and a skewed way of speaking and reacting that suggests something off, something corrupt and in touch with the darkest elements in the universe. Yet at the same time, we are always aware that we are watching McConaughey putting on a mask for our amusement.  The same can be said for Thomas Haden Church as the dim-witted patriarch, Gina Gershon as his louche wife and Emile Hirsch, usually smart and scrubbed, who here plays Haden Church's son, a scruffy dunce. All the actors are both in their roles and standing to the side presenting them, and somehow this seems very right for Killer Joe and a shrewd choice on the part of William Friedkin, the director. The one exception to this - also a shrewd choice - is Juno Temple, who plays the teenage daughter dead-on as innocent and peculiar and too damaged to be truly knowable. The movie is based on the play by Tracy Letts (Bug, August: Osage County), who is also an actor and knows how to write roles that actors want to play. So from the beginning - when Chris (Hirsch) shows up at his father's door and his stepmother (Gershon) answers the door naked from the waist down - there is never a moment without some bizarre turn of thought or action.Matthew McConaughey (right, with Emile Hirsch) hits all the right notes in Killer Joe.Matthew McConaughey (right, with Emile Hirsch) hits all the right notes in Killer Joe.Matthew McConaughey has the title role in William Friedkin's Killer Joe.Matthew McConaughey has the title role in William Friedkin's Killer Joe.An undated handout photo of Emile Hirsch, left, and Matthew McConaughey in William Friedkin's Killer Joe.

Speaking of the nudity, Killer Joe is rated NC-17, and yet even considering the naked Gershon, the strong language and a lewd, disturbing scene involving a chicken leg, the rating seems harsh. Or at least it does when you consider that the nihilistic The Dark Knight Rises got away with a PG-13.  Killer Joe revolves around a moneymaking scheme, a sick one, in which a son contrives to have his mother murdered and enlists his father and sister in the plot. The goal is to collect on the insurance money, and to make sure the murder is done professionally, they bring in a police detective known as Killer Joe, who moonlights as a killer for hire. So for much of the movie we have the spectacle of a family of dirty, dirt-poor wannabe-evil imbeciles interacting with this cold, gleaming, impeccably attired exemplar of the real thing, who is invariably polite and yet capable of doing anything to anybody at any moment. This is old-time country noir, a Baroque expression of the American id, and a knowing bloodbath that's pulpy, heightened and twisted fun. Whenever the characters seem as if they can't possibly get more appalling, they do. It's brilliantly written - it might be a guilty pleasure otherwise - and yet something about Killer Joe keeps it this side of greatness and more in the realm of a dazzling stunt.  Still, to be fair, most stunts fizzle out before the finish, but Killer Joe maintains its invention and energy all the way through the final seconds. The ending is the best of both worlds - a surprise in the moment and, upon reflection, inevitable.",1
"Nicole Kidman wakes up from a nightmare and finds herself in bed with a man she doesn’t recognize. In the bathroom, there are photos of herself and this man, taken over the course of years — vacations, wedding pictures. She looks at them vacantly, and when she walks out of the bathroom, the man (Colin Firth) is sitting on the edge of the bed with an explanation: He is her husband, and she has amnesia.That is, she has the worst case of amnesia ever. A victim of a bad accident some 10 years before, she wakes up every morning thinking she is in her early 20s, when in fact she is 40. Every day, she accumulates information about herself, learns her story and goes about her life. And every morning she wakes up a blank canvas, with no memory of the day before.Based on the novel by S.J. Watson, the movie depicts a type of amnesia that actually does exist, but if it didn’t, the movies would have had to invent it. Gradually, “Before I Go to Sleep” emerges as a mystery — one with a slow burn leading to a big payoff. But what keeps the movie going, beyond questions of what is true and what is false, are the issues raised by the illness itself. What is a person without a past? What is the value of an experience if it can’t be remembered?Nicole Kidman plays a person dazed by a constant, ongoing now. A brain injury has forced her to do that thing we’re always told we’re supposed to be doing: She is living completely in the present, and it’s making her scared and miserable.Then the phone rings. It’s a brain specialist (Mark Strong), introducing himself for the hundredth time, who is working on her case pro bono. He tells her things about her past that contradict her husband’s account. One of the men is lying. That doesn’t necessarily mean that one of them is sinister, but it does make you wonder.“Before I Go to Sleep” is smartly constructed to keep an audience guessing at every moment. First we trust the husband, then the therapist, and back and forth at least two or three times. The husband is a little weird and withdrawn, but he’s played by Colin Firth, and with him that’s usually considered a good thing. Besides, anyone might become weird having to reintroduce himself to his panic-stricken wife every morning. Anyone might become stern and unemotional, repressed and slightly scowling — again, just like Colin Firth.As for the therapist, he seems reasonable, but he’s played by Mark Strong, who is usually a villain, and his interest in his patient seems more than professional. He is clearly attracted to her, but is that so strange? Is that necessarily a bad thing?These are the questions we ask ourselves, which are also the questions the woman is asking herself, and this cements a bond between the character and the audience. She is desperate to decide these matters, so she can attach a meaning to her life, which she has to do before she goes to sleep. The audience, meanwhile, is a little more patient than that. We just want her to get it right.Considering the cast, the strong performances should come as no surprise. Looking back, every gesture makes sense and is consistent with the truth as revealed. Kidman, in particular, takes honors for her smart, unshowy work, conveying desperation with her eyes and terror in the way she refuses to trust anyone with her real emotion.

"Norbit: Comedy. Starring Eddie Murphy and Thandie Newton. Directed by Brian Robbins. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to SFGate.com/movies.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle reviews.]So he sings and dances in Dreamgirls and he looks sad when his producer is mean to him. But does he play a 300-pound woman? Does he play an old Chinese man? Norbit is a tour de force in which Murphy plays three distinct characters, two of them to the hilt. In fact, the only thing that makes Norbit good rather than great is that the title character is a bit bland. He's caught between Murphy's need to make him ridiculous and his function within the script as, more or less, a romantic lead. So that's the bad news: It's not a classic. The good news, however, has something to do with sitting in a theater laughing out loud for 105 minutes. This is Murphy doing what he does best, genial cruelty and good-natured nastiness. His comedy is so obvious that he dares the audience to see every moment coming and then delivers by topping expectations and making his jokes bigger and more ridiculous than anyone could imagine. You've heard of rapier wit. This is sledgehammer wit, wielded with sledgehammer precision. Life has always been cruel to Norbit (Murphy). As an infant, he was thrown from a car, by his parents, and adopted by Mr. Wong (Murphy), the owner of a Chinese restaurant/orphanage. Before he has a chance to come into his own, he is taken under the wing of a very fat girl, and as soon as he and Rasputia (Murphy) are old enough, they marry. Rasputia is the great comic creation of Norbit. For those familiar with Murphy's standup work, there are echoes here of his descriptions of his maternal aunt, an enormous woman who'd fall down the steps every Fourth of July and destroy the stairway. The difference is that Rasputia is phenomenally ill-tempered, sexually driven and absolutely convinced of her own physical attractiveness. She shows up at a water amusement park wearing a bikini and has to lift up her stomach to show that she's wearing bottoms. This is the level of comedy we're dealing with here. If that doesn't sound funny to you, you're not the audience. Rasputia's obesity is the subject of a number of hilarious sight gags: Scenes of her pouncing on her husband demanding physical satisfaction, a shot of her going down a waterslide and a running motif of her taking up the whole bed and rolling over her husband. Yet, the fat jokes would exhaust themselves were it not for the character work. Murphy's eyes, his facial expressions as Rasputia, her stare, the way she carries herself -- all of this is hysterically funny, a portrait of someone deluded about herself in every possible way. More than a sight gag, Rasputia is a villain, someone in stark contrast to the lovely Kate, played by Thandie Newton (whose haggardness in The Pursuit of Happyness was just part of the role). Kate has a handsome fiance (Cuba Gooding Jr.), but she has a rapport with Norbit, and he can't help but hope. It's a measure of the effectiveness of this often outlandish film that it builds a strong desire within the audience for Norbit and Kate to get together. As for Mr. Wong, it took me two-thirds of the movie to figure out that Murphy was playing him. At first, I was wondering who was this very funny Asian actor. I began to catch on when I noticed the movie giving him loads of screen time, when I realized he was playing a Chinese man with an absurd Japanese accent and when he began to complain about Brack people. Or, to put it another way, I caught on he was Murphy when I realized he was too funny to be anybody else. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and coarse humor. ",1
"O: Drama. Starring Mekhi Phifer, Josh Hartnett and Julia Stiles. Directed by Tim Blake Nelson. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) But it's not close to ridiculous. Screenwriter Brad Kaaya and director Tim Blake Nelson commit themselves to Shakespeare's story and to the emotions it contains with unwavering fidelity. They approach the high school setting with the same commitment. High school isn't bent to accommodate Shakespeare, and Shakespeare isn't distorted -- or softened -- for high school. The result is that a tale of teen violence takes on qualities of timelessness and universality it would not otherwise possess, while the Othello story leaps out from the screen with a rare immediacy. Watch O and then see Oliver Parker's lifeless Othello (1995), with Laurence Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh in the leads. Even with the best actors playing the best material, the magic doesn't always happen. It happens here. Mekhi Phifer plays Odin, the star basketball player and only black student in a Charleston, S.C., high school. He has a girlfriend named Desi (Julia Stiles), who thinks he's great, and a best friend, Hugo (Josh Hartnett), who knows he's great and secretly hates him for it. On several occasions, the camera lets us see Odin from Hugo's vantage point -- swaggering, beaming, arrogant. Odin is a loyal friend, but the movie makes it clear exactly how Hugo might get sick of contemplating the glory of Odin on a daily basis. Two kinds of people will see O, those who know Othello and those who don't. Those who don't will experience as intense a high school film as has ever been made, but those who know Othello will have the added satisfaction of admiring the novel adjustments and conversions the filmmakers introduce. The most effective of these is a new character, the basketball coach, played by Martin Sheen. In the world of Othello, the government of Venice is the source of all honor and approbation. In O, honors are bestowed by the coach, who, in the grand Southern tradition, is all about winning. At an awards ceremony, at which he announces Odin as the season's most valuable player, he says he loves him like a son. It's a tactless remark, since Hugo -- his real son -- is sitting in the crowd. Hugo, a chip off the old block, also thinks life is about winning, and since he can't defeat Odin on the basketball court, he sets about dismantling him psychologically, morally and physically. Hugo's motives are diabolical yet understandable, a combination that equals scary. Hugo, as Iagos often do, dominates the story, while Odin is the fellow who gets run over by a truck in slow motion. Hugo intuits that the way to destroy Odin is to undermine his relationship with Desi, and he contrives to do this by planting the idea that Desi is cheating on him with Odin's teammate Michael. O has one advantage over Othello -- since it's a new movie, not a classic, it has the power to surprise. Hugo's plot, like that of Iago, is flimsy. One word either way, and it would collapse. The suspense is powerful. The viewer's impulse is to root for Odin, but the filmmakers give us the story from Hugo's point of view, making us watch the movie in a jumble of free- floating tension. It's unlikely these young actors will get anything stronger to play any time soon. Hartnett makes a smoldering, subtle villain. Julia Stiles, with her precocious self-confidence, is a radiant Desi, and her scenes with Mekhi Phifer are not the usual kid stuff. The stumbling quality to the intimacy doesn't obscure our ability to see that these are two intelligent people who just happen to be very young. Race, but not racism, plays a role in O, as it does in Othello. White girls are snaky, Hugo tells Odin, and Odin has to take his word for it. Phifer is particularly strong at letting us see the strain as Odin tries to maintain his dignity and reserve, while gradually coming to see himself as a stranger surrounded by enemies whose deviousness he is incapable of penetrating. O was filmed in early 1999 and was intended for release later that year, but it was held up after the Columbine school shooting and eventually dropped by Miramax, its distributor. Actually, the story has nothing to do with Columbine, but it's tough stuff, all the same, bloody and passionate, and with a couple of love scenes that will raise eyebrows, too. It's true to its source. ",1
"OCEAN'S ELEVEN: Caper comedy. Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Steven Soderbergh is a director who makes only intelligent films, and although it would be too much to say that Ocean's Eleven might have been better off with an idiot as director, he is definitely an odd match for this material. He invests the relationships with weighty emotional truth and films the caper with a cold precision reminiscent of Brian De Palma's handling of Mission Impossible. This isn't bad, but it's all a little heavy and keeps the picture from taking flight. That's just Soderbergh's style. Fortunately, his artistic intelligence keeps him from suffocating all the life out of Ocean's Eleven, which buzzes along at a mildly entertaining pitch from start to finish. Along the way, the less congenial aspects of the Rat Pack are discarded -- the self-satisfaction, the misogyny, the celebration of drunken slobhood. For actors George Clooney, Brad Pitt and company, this is a chance to match themselves against an earlier model of manhood. One thing about guys like Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford -- they were adults. They were so grown up, it was hard to imagine them ever as children. It was as if they'd spontaneously generated in a nightclub-greenhouse somewhere. Meanwhile, the line on contemporary actors has been that they seem callow, that they never quite grow up. But in Ocean's Eleven, the new guys stack up to the originals quite nicely. We first see Clooney as a graying, scraggly-looking prisoner. A minute later, he's out of jail. His hair has been cut and dyed, and he's breezing into a casino in a sharp sports jacket, looking like someone who ought to be in pictures. Just as it's a kick to see Cary Grant or Fred Astaire walk across a room, it's a singular pleasure of Ocean's Eleven just to watch Clooney move. He's not the only one. There's also Pitt, comical and at ease, all good looks and mischief. In one scene, he and Clooney get on an elevator, and for a second, the story goes out the window and all that's left is spectacle -- the handsomest elevator ride of the new millennium. Ocean's Eleven does not lack for star wattage. Clooney is Danny Ocean, a man with a plan to rob the central safe that holds the cash for three Las Vegas casinos. To accomplish this, he hooks up with an old pal, Rusty (Pitt), and puts together a dream team of crooks and con men. Matt Damon is a pickpocket. Don Cheadle plays a demolitions expert. Bernie Mac is a card dealer, and Carl Reiner has a particularly juicy role as an old con man. Danny is interested in robbing these casinos in particular because they're owned by Benedict (Andy Garcia), a ruthless billionaire who is now romancing Ocean's ex-wife, Tess. In an example of casting clout gone awry, Soderbergh casts Julia Roberts as Tess, who tanks every scene she's in with her sour, self-righteous performance. The good news is that she's not in many scenes. Yet the question lingers throughout: Why would a guy who looks like Clooney risk anything to get back a nasty, unpleasant wife? Clooney generated a lot more warmth with Jennifer Lopez in Soderbergh's Out of Sight. Ocean's Eleven is filled with slick storytelling touches that work to constantly push the action forward. Whenever people talk about something, the picture switches to a voice-over and we see them actually doing it. In a warehouse, the men build a facsimile of the safe, with the backing of a shady financier (played with gusto by Elliott Gould.) We see the men practicing the caper, so when they pull the job, we can tell what's going right according to plan and what's going wrong. The picture also leaves enough unexplained so as not to kill the big surprises. Soderbergh indulges in a nice silent-movie effect, near the finish, in which Debussy's Claire de Lune, first in a piano version and later orchestrated, underscores an entire sequence. One could question what Debussy has to do with Las Vegas, or for that matter what Soderbergh's approach has to do with Ocean's Eleven. But in the end, everyone comes out of Vegas a little bit ahead.

"Oceans Thirteen: Caper film. Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Matt Damon, Ellen Barkin and Elliot Gould. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Ocean's Twelve solved the problem of mood. The movie seemed like it must have been a party to make, and it solved the Roberts problem, too -- she lightened up. But the story was a mess; it made no sense, and the fun-caper aspect was gone, or at least weakened. Which brings us to today, to Ocean's Thirteen and the rare case of a movie franchise following The Three Bears pattern: The third one is just right. Like the first Ocean's, Ocean's Thirteen is a satisfying story of a grand-scale swindle, but it also retains the impishness and charm of Ocean's Twelve. Even better, it solves the Roberts problem in the most thorough and economical way possible: She's not in the movie. This time Al Pacino gets to be the villain, and that says a lot about the movie's appeal. He plays an unscrupulous entrepreneur opening a hotel in Las Vegas, which means he gets to wear loud suits and treat everybody like garbage, exactly the kind of behavior we want and expect from Pacino. The first victim of his callous thieving is poor Elliot Gould as Reuben. The crooked Willy Bank (Pacino) tricks him in business, wipes him out financially and leaves him crumpled on the floor with a heart attack. He made the right choice, Willy says. Roll over and die. But Reuben doesn't die. And Reuben has friends, including Danny Ocean (Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt) and oh, say, about nine or 10 other guys. Willy is gearing up to open his hotel and casino -- set to be the most exclusive and luxurious place in Vegas -- but Ocean's gang is out to bring him down. With that, I have just described the only thing I understood about Ocean's Thirteen, which points up a funny thing about movie storytelling. Many of the specifics of the plan to fleece Willy are almost impenetrable. Perhaps they're meant to be impenetrable. There was certainly no anxiety on director Steven Soderbergh's part that everything should be clear. Yet it doesn't really matter if a thousand small details are unclear so long as there's no mistaking the broad movement of the story: There's Pacino. Clooney, Pitt and company are going to rob him. So sit back and enjoy the spectacle. Soderbergh, who brought his moodiness to bear on Ocean's Eleven and his love of absurdity and zaniness to bear on Ocean's Twelve, keeps his directorial personality out of Ocean's Thirteen, but his artistry is everywhere. The first shot, which takes place in the middle of a routine heist, has an offhand elegance. Especially impressive -- you'll feel it even if you don't notice the technique -- is the early shot of Pitt leaving a building and walking toward a private airplane. Pitt, in a cream-colored suit, is shot from below with the sky behind him, so that he looks like a lord of the universe. When the plane comes into the frame, the angle actually makes Pitt look taller than the plane. Clooney doesn't get that sort of visual support here, but his easy charm is all over the picture. Andy Garcia brings sly comedy to Benedict, once Ocean's enemy, now his (sort of) ally. It's a strong Ocean's, as well, for Matt Damon, who has several good scenes seducing Ellen Barkin as Willy's assistant. As for Barkin, consider this: She's practically the only woman in the movie. That means that at 53, she's all the sex this movie is going to have -- and all it needs, as it turns out. The film is packed with entertaining bits. One of the best involves a hotel reviewer (David Paymer) who comes to Willy's casino -- and the steps taken by Ocean's gang to assure that he has the worst time of his life. There are looney technological gadgets and a funny running gag about a worker's rebellion in Mexico. The whole film is full of invention, and about the only bad thing that can be said for Ocean's Thirteen is that the climax almost doesn't feel like a climax. It feels more like there should be another turn, a topper. But the best thing trumps the bad thing. Audiences will come away feeling that there could be nothing more rewarding and pleasurable than being a high-stakes world-class thief. It just looks like a beautiful life. -- Advisory: Strong language and lawlessness. ",1
"Of all the creative gifts, the ability to edit — that is, to edit text — is the least heralded and the least understood. Most people have never been edited, and those who benefit from it most tend to forget that the editing ever happened. But the ability to see a shape within a mess, to recognize a structure before it’s in place, to understand on a first read what is there that doesn’t belong and what belongs that isn’t there — this is no casual talent. Yet just as no one ever finds and compliments your hairstylist when you happen to look good, no one thinks about editing, and so it’s a particular pleasure to see “Genius” make it onto the screen. The movie is the story of the editor Max Perkins and his relationship with the eccentric novelist Thomas Wolfe, and about midway through we figure out which one the filmmakers consider to be the genius. This is confirmed when we find out that the film is based on the biography “Max Perkins: Editor of Genius,” by A. Scott Berg, though even that title hints at a double meaning.More than any other editor, Max Perkins (1884-1947) changed American literature. Working at Scribners, he took a chance on F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, and in the case of Thomas Wolfe, he more or less edited him into coherence, or at the very least, commercial viability. Early in the film, Perkins (Colin Firth) gets a manuscript that’s about 8 inches high and has been rejected by everyone. He starts reading it on the train, back and forth to his house in the suburbs, and when he’s finished, he arranges to meet the author.Jude Law isn’t physically what you’d picture for Wolfe, who was 6 feet 6 and on the heavy side, but Law creates a vivid character, spilling over with life and passion — but also anger and judgment. He speaks, as he writes, in a torrent of words, and his sensitivity is appealing, even though it extends only to himself. He is the type of person who makes friends easily and loses them, inevitably.Firth’s Perkins is practically his opposite. He strikes no artist poses. He looks more like an old-time newspaperman and sits at his desk, in a dim room, with his hat on. He listens a lot more than he talks, possibly because he has a slight speech impediment, and he seems genuinely modest about his own abilities, even though he’s sure of his opinions. You would trust your book with this man, which is not quite the same as saying that you would trust him with your life, but it’s something along that line.“Genius” follows the quasi-father son relationship that develops between the two men. (Perkins, who had five daughters — all of them adorable as presented here — had always wanted a son.) It shows also, and this is interesting, the nuts and bolts of the actual work. It took months and months to get “Look Homeward, Angel” into shape for publication, and even longer to get “Of Time and the River” ready, because after the success of the first book, Wolfe was harder to deal with.At the same time, Perkins must also deal with Wolfe’s personal life, which always has a vaguely sordid edge, and with an older mystery woman (Nicole Kidman), who was involved with Wolfe and decides that Perkins is her enemy.“Genius” took a long time to make it to the screen. The book it’s based on was published in 1978. Clearly, it wasn’t an obvious box office draw, but for those interested in this rich period in American literature, it’s a treat. Ernest Hemingway (Dominic West) makes a brief appearance, acting very Hemingwayesque, and even better are Guy Pearce’s scenes as F. Scott Fitzgerald. The movie portrays Fitzgerald as he must have seemed in that period, a young man old before his time and a writer past his prime. Only Perkins seems to know that, of all his many writers, Fitzgerald is the best he’s got. ",1
"One Last Thing... : Comedy-drama. Starring Michael Angarano, Cynthia Nixon and Sunny Mabrey. Directed by Alex Steyermark. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) First, what it's not: It's not maudlin. It's not clinical. It doesn't dwell on symptoms. Hospital interludes are kept to the barest minimum. The kid, a teenager, is not saintly. And there's no fake uplift to suggest that maybe this really was for the best, after all, and that life is mysterious, wonderful and grand. Actually, One Last Thing ... does make audiences feel that life is mysterious, wonderful and grand, but it does so by never saying it and by staying grounded in the earthy, messy ways in which people live. Mostly, One Last Thing ... is a comedy, one that's unusually well observed and directed by Alex Steyermark with a sensitivity for the individuality of character. It establishes its tone in the first scene, in which 16-year-old Dylan (Michael Angarano) is getting stoned on medical marijuana with two perfectly healthy friends. And it comes busting out of the gate with a great premise within 10 minutes. At a televised ceremony, Dylan is granted one last wish by a charitable foundation and decides, to the embarrassment of his mother (Cynthia Nixon), to be honest about what he really wants: A weekend alone with his favorite supermodel. This is a fun idea that presents a challenge for screenwriter Barry Stringfellow. How can he keep it going? If the model says no, the story hits a dead end. If she says yes, it's a short movie. And if our hero never meets her until the finish, the audience will feel cheated. Instead, the movie thrives because Stringfellow finds a real story to tell, grounded not only in the desires of the young man but also in the personal history of the model, Nikki (Sunny Mabrey), who emerges as someone a lot more complicated and troubled than her windblown photo shoots would suggest. The publicity surrounding Dylan's wish comes at a point in the model's life when she's beginning to unravel, drinking and taking pills, blowing assignments and getting an opaque look in her eyes, like someone with no soul. She's on the verge of losing her no-nonsense agent -- played by Gina Gershon (who was excellent in Steyermark's film Prey for Rock & Roll) -- and is plagued by bizarre nightmares, in which her past merges with her present in unsettling ways. The dream sequences are especially well done and form a link between Nikki and Dylan: He's hallucinating because he's on the verge of death. She's seeing things because she's on the verge of spiritual death. Despite their outward calm, their souls are screaming. The across-the-board strong performances indicate a sure directorial hand. Everyone is made vivid, down to the smallest roles. Michael Rispoli has a single scene as the owner of an Eastern religion store, who counsels Dylan, and it's some of his best work. Rispoli plays subhuman gangster types so often that the tendency is to confuse him with the roles he plays, but Steyermark shows there's more to him than that. The director guides Angarano to a witty, sensitive performance as Dylan and brings out an uncompromising honesty in Mabrey, as Nikki. Best of all, Steyermark is wise enough to build moments around Nixon, who can always be counted on to bring a fullness of emotion to her work. Nixon doesn't need dialogue. Just put a camera on her, sitting alone in a kitchen, and we get everything we need to know about the anguish of anticipated grief. -- Advisory: This film contains drug use, strong language, nudity and sexual situations.

"Out of Time: Thriller. Starring Denzel Washington, Eva Mendes and Sanaa Lathan. Directed by Carl Franklin. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Out of Time is a shrewd thriller that takes the time-honored plot about an innocent man wrongfully accused and gives it a film-noir twist. Here, our hero is not exactly innocent. He's a little bit dirty, guilty not of murder but of another crime anyone might have committed under the same circumstances. He's also not accused of anything right away. He just sees where the damaging evidence is pointing and knows that he has only hours to solve the crime and clear himself. He plays Matt, a police chief on the Keys who has a safe full of drug money, having just completed a major bust. His professional life is comfortable, but he's estranged from his wife, Alex (Eva Mendes), an ambitious homicide detective, and he's having an affair with a married woman, Ann (Sanaa Lathan). Her husband is no pushover, either, but a nasty former NFL player (Dean Cain). Director Carl Franklin and first-time screenwriter Dave Collard make use of every opportunity to crank up the heat and turn up the emotion, so that even before the thriller plot has kicked into gear, the audience is in the movie's grip. The Chief's affair with Ann is not some tepid dalliance but something so blindingly passionate that it could be the real thing. Her husband is the obvious obstacle to the romance, but then another, even worse one, presents itself. The Chief accompanies Ann to a doctor's office and finds out that her cancer has recurred and that she has only six months to live. He didn't even know she was sick. So we have love, sex, passion and a death sentence -- and not even 20 minutes have gone by. The complications keep coming. Like a song with multiple melodies and sections, Out of Time is generous with its story, laying down a highly charged backdrop against which the rest of the action will play. It's only when two murders are committed that the picture reveals its true nature, as a tense suspense drama. For most of the movie, the audience watches in a state of ever-mounting anxiety as the Chief tries to do two things at once, each seemingly impossible. He works to suppress a flood of incoming evidence, so that he's not implicated. And he works to find the real killers before he's framed. His task is complicated by the fact that suppressing evidence necessitates being in the office, while solving the crime means being in the field. He has to be in two places at once. As the movie's example of flawed but relatively decent humanity, Washington cuts a sympathetic figure, doing his best to present a blank face to his co- workers, occasionally breaking into an uneasy smile when he feels cornered. The movie needs an actor who can lie through his teeth without losing the audience, and it has that. Washington is surrounded by actors who clearly have been well directed. Mendes, as the homicide detective, looks at her estranged husband with the steady, ungiving gaze that we've seen on the face of every frightening investigator since Edward G. Robinson in Double Indemnity. She is of that breed -- the kind whose mind will not allow for loose ends. We spend most of the movie wondering how much she knows. Also in the eerie, smarter-than-he-looks category is John Billingsley as the Chief's co-worker, the medical examiner. Alfred Hitchcock would have cast Hume Cronyn in the role -- a sly character whose surface goofiness is a cover for an unconventional moral nature. But for good or evil? As Ann's menacing husband, Cain also has some strong moments, in particular a barroom scene in which the husband and the Chief talk in hypotheticals but essentially communicate a couple of stressful truths: One man is sleeping with the other's wife, and they both know it. The setting, the Gulf Coast in summer, adds a sultry atmosphere of living on the edge -- geographically, ethically, legally. It looks like a good place to feel free and get into trouble. ",1
"Outfoxed: Rupert Murdochs War on Journalism: Documentary. Directed by Robert Greenwald. (Not rated. 78 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Directed by Robert Greenwald, Outfoxed is a documentary obviously made on the cheap. Consisting almost entirely of interviews (Al Franken, James Wolcott and others) and of excerpts from Fox News, it seems as if it were recorded on a camcorder and narrated by a guy sitting in his kitchen with a microphone. That doesn't negate its effectiveness, however. Think of it as the cinematic equivalent of a pamphlet printed in somebody's basement. No one wants to be handed a pamphlet. But sometimes you take one anyway, get on the bus and read the whole thing. And afterward you think, Hmm. Interesting. Outfoxed is like that. The movie answers a naive question that I've always had about Fox: How is the political point of view enforced? Do they hire only conservatives, and how do they know if these hires really are conservative? Couldn't they just pretend to be conservative until they're in power, like Supreme Court nominees? Of course, this line of questioning is naive because it assumes that at Fox, as in every other news organization, the reporting comes from the bottom up; that is, that reporters and editors find the stories, and that the stories find placement on the basis of their news value. Instead, according to Outfoxed, the policy at Fox News comes from the top down. Daily memos come from the corporate office telling the reporters and news personalities what the story of the day will be. These directives include not only the day's subject but the point of view expected to be taken in reporting it. One day, the assignment will be to portray Kerry as a flip- flopper. The next, to talk about how Iraqis never had it better. The next, to try to portray Kerry as looking French. Ideas favorable to Fox's slant are introduced by the words some say. In journalism, those words can be fairly used to protect unnamed sources. On Fox, as Greenwald shows, they're used to inject opinion and spin under cover of reporting an existing phenomenon: Some say Kerry looks French. The grip that Fox exerts on its staff is illustrated by the case of John DuPre, a reporter assigned to cover the 90th birthday festivities at the Ronald Reagan presidential library three years ago. There were no festivities. There was barely anyone there all day, except for a school class tour. DuPre tried to tell his bosses there was no story, but they told him to come up with one. He did. (They've been arriving since dawn, he eventually said in his report -- probably referring to himself and his crew.) But he was suspended anyway. In another case, a reporter was reassigned during the 2000 Florida recount for strenuously questioning George W. Bush's representative, Jim Baker, during a televised news conference. Other reporters don't have to be kept in line. Carl Cameron, Fox's chief political reporter, is shown shyly fawning and simpering over an exhausted Bush in 2000, minutes before an interview. The conversation? It concerned Cameron's wife, who at the time was working for the Bush campaign. She's a good soul, Bush sighs. Then the interview begins. There's extensive footage of talk show personality Bill O'Reilly, including a shocking scene of him berating Jeremy Glick, a young leftist whose father was killed in the World Trade Center bombing. Then again, O'Reilly is known for this behavior. More unsettling, in a way, is the footage of Brit Hume. After updating the American death toll in Iraq at 277, he points out that a soldier in Iraq has about as much chance of dying there than any random Californian has of getting murdered. That's what's called putting things in perspective. The movie's most damning revelation is in the form of a poll revealing that regular watchers of Fox come away with gross misconceptions about current events. They watch the news and get a distorted impression of the world. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language. ",1
"Over the past decade, Bill Condon has been directing big, splashy movies, such as “Dreamgirls,” not to mention two entries in the “Twilight” series. Yet “Mr. Holmes” feels more like the real Bill Condon, the one who gave us “Gods and Monsters” and “Kinsey.” Like those predecessors, “Mr. Holmes” takes place in the middle of the 20th century and is smart, sedate and well acted.Based on Mitch Cullin’s novel “A Slight Trick of the Mind,” “Mr. Holmes” imagines the old age of Sherlock Holmes, the fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It’s 1947, the war is over, and Holmes is residing in the countryside. He has a housekeeper (Laura Linney), and, aside from his beekeeping hobby and his memories, she and her little boy (Milo Parker) are his world. By the way, it helps going in to know that Holmes is supposed to be 93; otherwise, you may see Ian McKellen and think the poor man is aging terribly.The first thing “Mr. Holmes” must do is convince the audience that this is indeed Sherlock Holmes. It must seduce the audience into melding our past knowledge of the character with the new fiction the movie is spinning. Along this line, the movie’s success is immediate, and then it deepens and becomes yet more rich, as the film reveals an understanding of Holmes in all of his complexity — his loneliness and his emotional timidity, as well as his intellectual bravado. We see Holmes in two time periods. In 1947, he is struggling with memory loss so severe that he must reach in vain for the names of people in his own household. Yet in the face of this, in between pursuing exotic remedies, he is trying to write — to set down the record of his last case, the one that made him give up sleuthing and retire to the country. This case, which took place some 30 years before, is also depicted, and in those scenes, McKellen looks a lot younger. Not a full 30 years younger, but young enough that we can stop worrying about him.“Mr. Holmes” is not an exciting film. One can imagine that, after “Twilight” movies, a director must treasure the chance to be intelligent and slightly dull instead of flashy and colossally stupid. “Mr. Holmes” plays out at one steady pace, without any alteration in velocity, but it always gives us something, some interplay of characters worth noting, some insight into the great detective’s personality. And all the while, it’s building. It’s heading somewhere.Gradually, the case in Holmes’ past becomes central to the story, and the woman involved in it takes on a greater importance. We see her, on and off, throughout the film, but she appears in only a single long scene, and if you want to see the influence that a great actress can exert with a minimum of screen time, watch Hattie Morahan here. Morahan is best known for her acclaimed work as Nora in the Young Vic production of “A Doll’s House,” which traveled from London to New York a few years ago. To her role in “Mr. Holmes,” Morahan brings such fullness of emotion, such attention, such innate dignity and such intuition that she is the one viewers will think of when the film is over. And if they think of Holmes, they will think of Holmes thinking of her. Acting on this level is like a form of magic or incantation. You can’t really explain it. You can only point to it and say, “Look at that.” So, look at that.",1
"POLLY16  BEN STILLER as Reuben Feffer and JENNIFER ANISTON as Polly Prince in the new romantic comedy from writer/director John Hamburg, Along Came Polly. Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller in &quo;Along Came Polly.&quo;POLLY16 BEN STILLER as Reuben Feffer and JENNIFER ANISTON as Polly Prince in the new romantic comedy from writer/director John Hamburg, Along Came Polly. Jennifer Aniston and Ben Stiller in &quo;Along CameAlong Came Polly: Romantic comedy. Starring Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by John Hamburg. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) No, it's not as funny (or original or shrewd) as Meet the Parents, written by John Hamburg, who wrote and directed Along Came Polly. But within the context of what is essentially a formula picture, Hamburg comes up with lively and anarchic comic situations, and he comes up with them consistently. Even when he gets desperate and resorts to borrowing gross-out bits from the Farrelly brothers, the laughs are still there. Not just appreciative smiles, but real laughs. Much of the credit has to go to the cast, which is headed by Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, but is comically skilled all the way down to the featured roles. Stiller plays Reuben, a risk assessor who gets married and has an elaborate reception, only to have his new wife (Debra Messing) dump him for a scuba instructor (Hank Azaria) on the first day of their honeymoon. It's the sort of humiliation Stiller was born to play, and Hamburg gets good mileage out of Stiller's look of hangdog misery when Reuben returns to work after the honeymoon and his co-workers treat him with unwelcome pity. Reuben's luck soon changes when he goes to an art gallery and meets an old classmate, Polly (Aniston), who is working as a waitress. They start dating and the comic conceit of the movie is that, while Reuben is risk-averse, Polly is a daring free spirit. One might expect from that a series of scenes in which Polly pushes Reuben into wild situations. But surprisingly, the movie never follows through on its premise. Polly likes dancing and ethnic food, and that's about as reckless as she gets. She's hardly a wild woman. The actors make up for the script's shortcomings through charm and expert timing. Aniston continues to establish herself as one of the most delightful of comic leading ladies. There's nothing cloying or narcissistic about her. Like Helen Hunt, she has a common touch, self-possession and a perspective broad enough for modesty. And Stiller, with the blazingly sincere look of a good son destined to be beat up by women, adeptly rides the line between goofball and comprehensible love interest. Sharp intelligence combined with utter powerlessness may be a classic comic state, but no one today makes that combination more painful and funny than Stiller. The supporting players provide some of the best laughs, most notably Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is a scream as Reuben's best friend, Sandy, a former child star gone to seed. Sandy is the film's best creation -- a know- it-all, a poseur, the world's worst basketball player (Let it rain! he yells each time he shoots a basket) and a complete slob. Hoffman embraces the challenge of playing a disgusting person and carries it off with good humor and gusto. Along Came Polly is a world populated by vulgarians; thus Reuben has a crude boss, played by Alec Baldwin. And Australian Bryan Brown has an amusing featured role as a thrill-seeking billionaire whom Reuben is assessing for a life insurance policy. His antics -- base jumping and riding sailboats into storms -- are welcome, even if they steal some of the wildness that, in a better-made script, would have belonged to Polly. Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and crude humor. ",1
"PURPLE RAIN: 1984 musical drama. Starring Prince, Apollonia Kotero and Morris Day. Directed by Albert Magnoli. (R. 111 minutes. At the Roxie.) Fifteen years. Skinny ties. Structured jackets. Ronald Reagan was in his first term. The Soviet Union was an evil empire, and Monica Lewinsky was 10. Prince's music was the freshest thing out there. Actually, his Purple Rain music still sounds fresh. Fresh music and silly dialogue -- those aspects of Purple Rain haven't changed over the years. The film was directed by Albert Magnoli, who went on to direct American Anthem and Street Knight, both bombs. Yet to see Purple Rain again is to realize that it has something, and it's not just Prince. The picture, which starts a week's run at the Roxie today, is a time capsule of style and attitude. It does what musicals are supposed to do: It rides the underlying currents of its moment and renders them glorious. Loosely based on aspects of Prince's life, Purple Rain is about a Minneapolis musician called the Kid, who wants to make a mark on the national scene. But emotional problems are holding him back. They surface when he tries to get close to his new girlfriend, Apollonia (Apollonia Kotero), a young singer. In one scene he punches her. Luckily for him she doesn't punch him back. Time has a way of making things obvious. Here's something obvious nobody seemed to have noticed in the 1980s: An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), Flashdance (1983), Purple Rain and Top Gun (1986) -- all huge hits -- told essentially the same story. They all embodied a distinctly mid-1980s dream. All four films were about cocky, talented and yet troubled young adults trying to hold on to a vision of themselves through success. In each, two things happen to help the protagonists find their moral center: Someone close to them either dies or almost dies. And someone they hardly deserve falls in love with them. Purple Rain and its catchy, synthesized soundtrack are as entangled in this '80s myth of redemption and selfish splendor as its characters are possessed by dreams of glory. The grandest and silliest moments are the ones in which Prince is onstage, rolling on the floor screeching, while Apollonia watches, moved at the profundity of it all. Prince is no actor -- he tends to mumble. But he can kiss a beautiful woman onscreen without looking like a geek, and not every guy can do that. The real film talent here, though, is Morris Day, who plays the Kid's funkster rival on the Minneapolis club scene. Day, who appears in a different suit in every scene, plays himself as a peacock and ladies' man. As a live performer, he's a worthy foil for Prince -- just as smooth and just as vain -- but lighthearted and self- mocking where Prince is serious. ",1
"Palindromes Comedy-drama. Starring Ellen Barkin, Debra Monk and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Directed by Todd Solondz. (Not rated. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). The consciousness at work here, grounded on a set of essentially self- protective philosophical misconceptions, seems ultimately too narrow, closed- off and turned in on itself to produce great art. Thus, to the extent that Palindromes aspires to be a statement about life, it fails. Yet in another way, the movie succeeds resoundingly, in that through it Solondz expresses and, in a sense, preserves what we might reasonably infer to be his inner life. Moreover, he does so with guts. There's no concession, no compromise, no penlight in the endless night, no joy and no hope in Palindromes. Despite its subdued tone, its pessimism is something brutal. It's about a 13-year-old girl who wants nothing but to become pregnant and have a child. The girl, Aviva -- the name is a palindrome, spelled the same backward and forward -- is shy and seemingly love-starved, despite an attentive mother (Ellen Barkin). The girl's story is told over a series of episodes, and in each episode, the actress playing her changes. In one long section, Aviva is black. In another, she's still 13 but looks about 40, as played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. The parade of actresses is more or less a gimmick, but it serves a couple of functions. Using different actresses allows Solondz to emphasize particular emotions and qualities in several scenes, to good effect. Changing Avivas also creates a double sense, both of the common nature of Aviva's experience and of her specific unimportance. It distances us, causing us to look at Aviva, not as a standard protagonist, but coldly, as a specimen of anonymous human misery. Palindromes is torturously slow at times, but it's often fascinating. To function in the world, according to Solondz, one inevitably enters into a lie. To do anything but remain in a state of emotional paralysis, one must construct a false personality that eventually prevents one from ever again locating even the most basic truth. For example, Barkin plays a mom who genuinely tries to help her pregnant daughter, but her every move is based on a monstrous selfishness and narcissism. What's interesting is that she seems to know it and to be trying to work against it, but she can't locate any truth inside herself. There's nothing real anymore. The place of purity is lost. Given Solondz's worldview, it's no surprise that he would connect metaphorically with the issue of abortion, which gives impetus to the main plot line. His treatment of the issue is unflinching and will upset people on both sides. Palindromes isn't a wise movie, or a particularly true movie, but it's an honest one and a singular experience. -- Advisory: This film contains violence and simulated sex. -- Mick LaSalle Daybreak Drama Starring Jakob Eklund, Ann Petrén and Magnus Krepper. Written and directed by Björn Runge. (In Swedish with English subtitles. R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). It's hard to see close-ups of couples bickering in Swedish and not think of Ingmar Bergman. Although the master had nothing to do with Daybreak, his influence is felt in this brooding saga of angst in a cold climate. You can practically feel the chill coming in from the North Sea. In the very first image, a surgeon operates on a damaged heart, an appropriate prelude to a film in which the lives of numerous unhappy people are laid out. They run the economic gamut from the doctor, Rickard (Jakob Eklund), who is cheating on his wife, to a bricklayer, Anders (Magnus Krepper), who rarely sees his family in his continual struggle to support them. Rich and poor alike, they're all looking for an escape hatch. To the extent that this difficult but ultimately rewarding film has a message, it's that you can't run away from who you are. Director Björn Runge deserves credit just for keeping the multiple stories straight. He jumps around from one household furnished in Scandinavian modern to the next almost identical one. But his segues are seamless, and there's never any confusion about where you are. Occasionally the characters' lives intersect, once literally at an intersection where one of them is almost mowed down by vehicles driven by two others. Rickard carries on a passionate affair with the wife of a doctor at the same hospital. His colleague discovers it and exacts an elaborately cruel punishment. An aging couple hires Anders to brick up all their windows and door, a bizarre request resulting from their estrangement from their only child. Eklund and Krepper bring an appropriate somberness to these men leading lives of quiet desperation. The film gets a jolt from Ann Petrén's raucous performance as Anita, who can't forgive her husband for leaving her for a much younger woman. Seeking revenge, Anita lets herself into the couple's home, which used to be hers, and, like a deranged Martha Stewart, criticizes the new wife's housekeeping practices. You still have the summer curtains up, and it's almost winter, she screeches. The quiet Swedish suburb where Daybreak is set is a regular Peyton Place with all the wife swapping that goes on. Guess people have to do something to stay warm. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual content. -- Ruthe Stein Fighting Tommy Riley Drama. Starring J.P. Davis. Directed by Eddie OFlaherty. (Rated R. 109 minutes. At the AMC 1000 Van Ness, and Presidio Theatre.). The sweet science seems to be one of pop culture's favorite metaphors lately: Clint's Million Dollar Baby cleaned up at the Oscars, Sly Stallone's reality TV show The Contender won out against The Next Great Champ, and singer-songwriter Aimee Mann climbed into the ring this week with her boxing- themed concept album, The Forgotten Arm. Now, in this corner, the indie upstart, Fighting Tommy Riley, and if it fails to land its big final punch, it's still a contender. In an aptly Rocky-esque twist, the movie was written by unknown actor J. P. Davis, who refused to sell his script unless he could play the title role. Davis -- imagine a Van Damme who can act, a gloweringly charismatic Abercrombie with total K.O. cheekbones -- plays Tommy, a short-fused, self- destructive young boxer who has all but abandoned his dream of going for the big time (he blew it at the 1999 Olympic trials). Tommy's raw talent is recognized and set free by a Melville-quoting, gone- to-seed trainer, Marty Goldberg (veteran actor Eddie Jones, never less than convincing in a lived-in part that's packed with pathos), an old-school ex- boxer who grabs this last chance and returns to life with Tommy's gradual success and friendship. But Marty's got his own (not-so-shocking) Secret, and where most boxing movies pay off with the stock scene of the underdog's climactic bout, the big round in Tommy Riley is a queasily confused emotional standoff between mentor and fighter. Working on a microbudget, director Eddie O'Flaherty coaches solid performances from his small cast and makes the most of the handful of up-close, well-choreographed fight montages. Working with digital video, cinematographer Michael Fimognari paints the gritty gyms and dingy apartments in moody blues and somber ochres. -- Advisory: This movie contains violence, rough language and sexual content. -- Joe Brown Drive Action comedy. Written and directed by Sabu. In Japanese with English subtitles. (Not rated. 100 minutes. At the 4-Star.). If you haven't entered the eccentric comic world of the filmmaker known as Sabu (nee Hiroyuki Tanaka), Drive is an excellent starting point, even if it seems it could have been a little stronger. A former actor and singer, Sabu's films inevitably involve an innocent everyman (usually, as here, played with an expression of perpetual shock by Shinichi Tsutsumi) who by pure chance falls into a plot of elaborate mayhem. This time, Tsutsumi is a salaryman, Asakura, who is carjacked and kidnapped by three bank robbers and ordered to pursue a fourth man, who has escaped with the loot and the getaway car. Trouble is, Asakura has spent his whole life playing by the rules, and that includes following the speed limit and all traffic signs, and even mastering that increasingly lost art that the old-timers once called a turn signal. So the man with the money gets away, but becomes trapped by literally a hole in the ground. The other three criminals are at first angered at Asakura, but later come to like him. As they drive through Tokyo, experiencing the spectrum of Japanese social life, they become less and less interested in the missing money and more about how they can fulfill their happiness without it. One, played by dependable character actor Ren Osugi, is an anti-drug crusader who joins a punk rock band to get his message across. There are also the ghosts of samurai and several uses of a baseball bat, but that would be too much to explain. It eventually does make sense in Sabu's quirky world. -- Advisory: This film contains scenes of comic violence and language. -- G. Allen Johnson ",1
"Paris, Je T'Aime: Comedy-drama. Directed by Olivier Assayas, Joel and Ethan Cohen, Gena Rowlands and others. Starring Juliette Binoche, Natalie Portman, Sergio Castellitto, Rufus Sewell and others. In French with English subtitles. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That this omnibus film has a cumulative impact justifies it as an enterprise and justifies the narrative strategy of the filmmakers. Yet it justifies a movie that needs no justification: Eighteen films set in Paris, featuring well-known actors and a roster of accomplished directors. Paris, Je T'Aime could have been worse, and it still would have been good. Montmartre, which starts the film, shows the beginning of a romance between two mature adults (director Bruno Podalydes and Florence Muller). We can fill in the rest. Quais de Seine, by Gurinder Chadha, traces the faint, innocent beginnings of a relationship between a Christian boy and a Muslim girl. Tuileries, directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, features Steve Buscemi having a tourist's nightmare in the Paris subway. The above are satisfying little shorts. Most of the films included are at least that good, though Alfonso Cuarón's Parc Monceau, with Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier, is just one joke, and not a very good one; and Vincenzo Natali's Quartier de la Madeleine, with Elijah Wood, is just another vampire movie -- but mercifully short. There are two standouts. Nobuhiro Suwa's Places des Victoires, starring Juliette Binoche, achieves an operatic intensity of emotion in a matter of seconds. It's extraordinary -- and so is Binoche. And Isabel Coixet's Bastille, with Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson, has a fascinating complexity of tone and impulse. It starts as the story of a superficial man planning to divorce his perfectly nice wife in order to marry a flight attendant, and so it has a quality of satire. But it seemingly goes to a tragic place without completely losing its satirical distance. Those are the great ones. There are plenty of good ones. Here's just one more: Olivier Assayas' Quartier des Enfants Rouges, with Maggie Gyllenhaal as a seemingly self-possessed American film star who buys drugs from a Parisian dealer. It's the beginning of an interesting movie that will never be made. -- Advisory: Nudity, strong language and adult situations. ",1
"Past eras always seem safer than they actually were because we survived them, either personally or as a species, but the 1970s held some real dangers, and “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” brings them back with truth and specificity. Unmoored from both traditional values and the loopy idealism of the 1960s, the ’70s’ prevailing moods were chaos and moral confusion. The movie reminds us of a time in which it was all too easy for people to get lost.It tells the story of a 15-year-old girl in 1976 whose life goes off the rails, almost irretrievably, because of her family situation and because of her own reckless and immature choices. Aside from its period accuracy, the most refreshing thing about the film is its moral complexity, which will probably make it controversial. Young Minnie (Bel Powley) is a victim, but she’s an active participant in her own victimhood, and everything she does makes her situation worse. In her, we see the makings of a confident, assertive adult — or of someone who will end up outlined in chalk by 1977. If you’ve heard anything about this movie, you know that it’s about a teenage girl who has a sexual relationship with her mother’s boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard). There’s nothing good to be said for a guy who would do such a thing, but the character, as presented in “The Diary of a Teenage Girl,” is not exactly a sexual predator, nor a pervert with a thing for underage girls. He’s just lowdown and happens to be around, and what takes place is less a symptom of any one individual’s pathology than of a twisted time.",1
"Paul Thomas Anderson is getting there. He is a great director of scenes, not of movies, but in “Phantom Thread” he has devised a film that hangs in from start to finish, his first since “Boogie Nights.” His strengths and weaknesses are as apparent as ever, but here his strengths are stronger and his weaknesses obscured. The result is not just a film to wrestle with and talk about, but enjoy.There is no director better at starting a film, and no director of commensurate talent who has been worse at ending one. And “Phantom Thread” follows that pattern, in the sense that its opening scenes are brilliant, and its closing is barely effective — not quite frogs raining from the sky (“Magnolia”), not quite someone drinking someone’s milkshake (“There Will Be Blood”), but gimmicky and unconvincing.However, this time the proportions are right. The central relationship — between a self-centered, obsessive dress designer (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his much younger lover, Alma (Vicky Krieps) — remains fascinating throughout, and the ending is, at least, efficient. After a little over two hours, Anderson finds a way to stop the train while his audience is still on board.“Phantom Thread” tells a story of obsessive creativity and how it can destroy everything in its path, when combined with the absolute license of great success. Reynolds (Lewis) is a top designer in 1950s London, who never stops working. We see him, in the first scene, sketching at breakfast and being berated by his latest girlfriend that he never pays attention to her. It hardly needs to be said that that’s the last time we see that girlfriend.What the women in his life don’t realize is that his relationships are not a relief from his work, or the point of his work. They function to augment his work, either to inspire him (in the beginning) or at least to keep the sex side of his existence from becoming a nagging distraction. We know all this about him, really, from the first scene — a marvel of economy from both Anderson and Day-Lewis. Thus, we stand warned, a couple of minutes later, when we see Reynolds working his charm on the young Alma, who becomes his next lover/victim/inspiration.Whoever thought that watching Daniel Day-Lewis make a dress could be so interesting? He seems to take in every inch of both the dress and the woman underneath it with a quality of knowing appreciation, accented by hints of worry and self-criticism. Will he be able to do it again? If he gets an idea, will he get the necessary next idea, and the one after? On their first night together, after rolling out a few well-practiced head games — “If this is a staring contest, I’ll win,” she says in response — he designs a dress for her. The sex can come later, an afterthought. This is the real intimacy.Also present for this intimacy is the designer’s sister (Lesley Manville), who runs the business and serves as a kind of Frau Blucher to the designer’s Dr. Frankenstein. The sister records Alma’s measurements as the designer calls them out, and everything in her manner suggests that this is all part of a pattern. First the dress, then the relationship, then the demands and the neediness. When it’s time for the latest girlfriend to go, it’s always the designer’s sister who breaks the news and makes sure that the young woman and her luggage are sent packing.But Alma has a lot of spine. She is young, naive and powerless, but she seems to know this man she’s involved with, and she’s a quick learner. She wants to assert herself into the center of Reynolds’ life, and the question of the movie — as well as its struggle and its drama — turns on that effort. Throughout, we don’t know if we’re seeing the familiar pattern play out, or if we’re about to witness something new.Supposedly, this is Daniel Day-Lewis’ last film, but sometimes it’s necessary to believe you’re retiring just to feel fresh in one’s work. (He is only 60 and surely has at least two or three of these retirements still ahead of him.) Reynolds is one of his best roles, which he plays with a mix of hardness and monumental selfishness, combined with an almost plaintive need to keep coming back to his own talent, to this thing that nourishes and devours him. For him, life is simple, a matter of just doing one thing. But to live that way can easily be the path to no life at all and, even more to be feared, artistic sterility.Like Alma is to Reynolds, Krieps doesn’t try to keep up with Day-Lewis. She watches him intently and finds her openings. She waits for her moments. Guided by Anderson, this is performance as rope-a-dope, and by the end, Krieps has become as compelling as her co-star, something nearly impossible. ",1
"Perfect Stranger: Thriller. Starring Halle Berry, Bruce Willis and Giovanni Ribisi. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) [Podcast: Pathfinder loses its way; Halle Berry gorgeous in Perfect Stranger]Indeed, to see her here is to realize how disappointing her feature films since Monster's Ball have been: A James Bond flick, a pair of X-Men outings, a few others. Monster's Ball showed the breadth of Berry's talent, but there has been little else until now. This is not to oversell Perfect Stranger. Really, it's just a competent and fairly satisfying thriller. But look at it instead for the acting values that Berry brings to it -- the shadings and details that work in the moment and become even more satisfying in retrospect. This is a shrewd, intelligent and captivating performance. Berry has the gift of anger. She also has the gift of seeming justified when she's angry (something that Barbara Stanwyck had, for example, and that Julia Roberts, alas, does not). Her sense of moral outrage runs deep, and it's present in the first scene, in which she gains entry into a Republican senator's office, posing as a sympathetic supporter. Turns out the senator, who has been an enemy of gay rights, is himself gay, and she has the proof. She's a reporter, and she's about to run with the story. Berry is even better in the following scene, in which she's in a bar, drinking and celebrating with her computer-wiz partner, Miles (Giovanni Ribisi), and her editor walks over with the bad news: The publishers have quashed the gay senator story. Watch Berry's intensity of focus. Watch her technique, as she transitions from triumphant drunkenness to sober realization to righteous rage. It's all beautifully accomplished but also carefully considered. The woman she plays, Rowena, has good reason for the anger beneath her polished surface. Berry understands it and gradually reveals it. The early scenes just set the tone. Rowena is already angry when word comes in that a childhood friend has been murdered, and that, in the months leading up to her death, she'd been seeing a rich big shot and threatening to go to his wife. The evidence isn't enough to present to the police, but it is enough for Rowena to infiltrate the big shot's advertising business. Rowena gets a job as an office temp, and it doesn't take long before the boss (Bruce Willis) notices her. It takes about two minutes, which, considering how gorgeous Berry looks throughout Perfect Stranger, probably constitutes a world record. That's the other thing. At 40 years old, Berry has never looked better on screen, and Perfect Stranger finds her in an ideal place -- not only in complete control of her technique, but with a cultivated understanding of her own charm and appeal as a screen entity. To see Perfect Stranger is to wish for a more sophisticated vehicle for a film actress this good, but actors -- and audiences -- take what they can get. This is better than most. She's supported by a decent cast, with dialogue that's coarse in the ways that people are coarse, and by consistently interesting and idiosyncratic character performances that speak well of James Foley's directorial hand. Berry's immediate co-stars are especially good, and contribute mightily to the strange combination of geniality and menace that pervades the picture. Willis, who has been pretty scruffy in his recent outings, cleans up nicely as the smug essence of a rich big shot, with his smooth smile, smooth walk and very smooth tailored suits. Excellent toupee, too: It looks like Willis' own hair, circa 1994. In a way, Ribisi is even more arresting as Rowena's pal, partner and loved-starved admirer. He could be a great guy, and he could be a dangerous creep. Ribisi plays it right down the middle, and he does it without being coy and holding back. Like Berry, he plays every moment full out, showing us everything, and it's up to us to decide what to make of it. -- Advisory: This film contains violence, nudity, sexual situations and strong language.

"Phone Booth: Thriller. Starring Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Kiefer Sutherland and Katie Holmes. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (R. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That's the intriguing premise of Phone Booth, whose release was pushed back from the fall because of the Washington, D.C.-area sniper shootings. Devising premises is easy compared with the task of building on one, embroidering it, wringing it for every drop of tension. The triumph of director Joel Schumacher and screenwriter Larry Cohen in Phone Booth is not just that they pull off the central gimmick but that they fashion from it a creditable thriller. The result is a movie that combines a seriousness of purpose with an impish delight in craft, in a way Hitchcock would have appreciated. It was Hitchcock, after all, who loved taking innocuous objects and locations and turning them sinister: the bread knife in Blackmail, the country kitchen in Torn Curtain and, most notoriously, the shower in Psycho.  Here Colin Farrell steps into a humble phone booth, that quaint echo from the previous century, and soon finds his composure, his reputation and his existence deconstructed. He plays Stu, a hotshot midlevel publicist who breezes along in midtown Manhattan, alternately schmoozing into his cell phone and barking orders at a flunky, who walks several paces behind him. We're probably supposed to dislike Stu, but as played by Farrell, he comes across as just another young hustler working the New York game. One game he's working is on a client (Katie Holmes) he's trying to seduce. Every day, he calls her from the same pay phone. He doesn't want his wife to see the number on the cell-phone statement. That justification for using a pay phone may sound improbable, but the screenwriter needed some way to get him into that phone booth. When Cohen originally conceived the movie -- he pitched the story to Hitchcock himself in the late '60s -- cell phones did not exist. When Stu picks up the phone, he finds that the sniper knows his name, his routine, his girlfriend's name and number, his wife's name and number -- this is a serial killer who has done his research. The sniper breaks through Stu's reserve by proving that he really does see him, and that he really does have a rifle. From there it's a case of ever-escalating mayhem, filmed, like Hitchcock's Rope, in real time, though not in long takes. Through spirited editing, Schumacher creates a sense of increasing urgency and dread. Farrell brings an emotional readiness to a role of a man who gradually finds himself terrified, humiliated and exposed, but Kiefer Sutherland -- as the voice of the sniper -- is equally remarkable. Acting with just one's voice is the same as acting with one's hands, legs, torso and head tied behind one's back. With his voice alone, Sutherland conveys shades of humor and disgust but above all qualities of menace and implacable malice that are chilling. Forest Whitaker lends his aura of concerned decency to the role of a police captain who mistakenly thinks Stu is a dangerous criminal. Hitchcock made his last movie in 1976, but many have tried to evoke him, before and ever since, from Truffaut and Chabrol to De Palma and M. Night Shyamalan. Most of these attempts that ape the Hitchcock style end up seeming self-conscious. But Phone Booth has its own style. What it takes from Hitchcock is the very thing that has so often eluded other efforts: It's the Hitchcock spirit, that deadpan, sadistic glee at putting one over on an audience. . This film contains violence and strong language. ",1

(HANDOUT PHOTO)Photo by: George Kraychyk (Foreground, left to right) Harrison Ford as Alexei Vostrikov, Liam Neeson as Mikhail Polenin and (back, left) Ingvar Sigurdsson as Gorelov in K-19: The Widowmaker. (HANDOUT PHOTO) K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER: Drama. Starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Based on a horrific real-life incident that happened in 1961 -- and that might have led to a nuclear nightmare -- the picture pairs Soviet submarine captain Harrison Ford and his second-in-command, Liam Neeson, who are forced to work together though they have distinctly different styles. Neeson plays Polenin, a genial officer loved by his men, who is removed from the helm of the K-19 when he is unable to get the boat ready in time for a dangerous mission. He's demoted to first officer and placed under the command of Capt. Vostrikov, a hard-nosed disciplinarian played by Ford in his patented if-I-smile-my-face-might-crack mode. Life in a submarine is bad enough, as anyone who ever saw Das Boot knows, but life in a physically compromised submarine is even worse. K-19 is a kind of Das Lousy Boot, about the valor of the men stuck inside a vessel that should never have gone to sea in the first place. It's also about hard choices and life-and-death decisions and two officers at each other's throats. In most naval movies, whenever there's a clash between two officers, we know which one embodies the movie's point of view. K-19 throws us a curve. In Polenin we see a reasonable and humane man who commands a lazy, feel-good crew. In Vostrikov, we see a stronger military man, who's also cold and dangerously reckless. Who is the better leader? In leaving this question open, the movie does more than play cute with the audience. It replicates the dilemma of the officers aboard the K-19. That K-19 could be made at all is a testament to improved relations between the United States and Russia. With the Cold War now history, we can now look back and admit the humanity of the other side. The K-19's mission, to set off a test missile, was designed to strike fear in President Kennedy and alert the American government of the Soviets' ability to wreak destruction from nuclear submarines. However, if this movie is any judge, Kennedy should have been more worried that the Soviets might blow up the Eastern Seaboard by accident, not intention. Director Kathryn Bigelow (Strange Days) gives us time to take in life aboard the submarine, to get a sense of the cramped conditions and the fragility of the vessel. In a particularly smart shot, she pans from a seaman lying inside his bunk, through the wall of his room to the outside of the submarine. It's just a thin metal wall separating them from all getting swallowed. From there, the movie starts piling on catastrophes, not in a sensational, action-movie way but with an adult sense of contained horror. Bigelow is known for making good, visceral movies, but here she adopts a kind of dignified watchfulness, and that feels right for the material. Most of K-19 is like an undersea China Syndrome, with the men fighting to prevent a nuclear meltdown that could lead to Armageddon. It's an effort that entails daunting sacrifices, which K-19 renders graphically but also with compassion. Ford and Neeson work well together. Their characters go on a journey, and by the time they get to the other side, they're different. We believe in their changes, even if we don't always believe in Ford's accent. At one point, he sounds as if he's trying to sound Irish. Still, no one could do stoic quite like Ford. In K-19 he's so stoic that when he tries to smile, his eyes go screwy and his face goes lopsided. Like Humphrey Bogart. The men in K-19 also undergo changes, and that's stirring as well. They go not only from self-interest to heroism but also from heroism to intelligent heroism. By the end, they're not heroes of a Soviet state that's unworthy of them, but of a world that only now is becoming privy to their sacrifice. . This film contains strong language and grim images of illness and death. ",1
"Poetic drama. Starring Sybil Temtchine, H.M. Wynant and Pippa Scott. Directed by Steven Peros. (Not rated. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Why does the movie Footprints not have wide distribution? It was made two years ago, and it's only now getting a week's run at the Roxie Theater. It's original and poetic, and if you see it you will probably remember scenes from it a year from now, because it's not really like anything else. It's very much its own thing. Actually, that might be why it hasn't been distributed - at least not yet. Most movies are sold in terms of their stars, genre or both, but Footprints is a movie without stars that falls between genres on the way to its own distinct tone. It's funny and sad and has an element of the fantastic, yet is very much couched in the concrete world of modern-day Hollywood. A young woman (Sybil Temtchine) in a green dress wakes up on the footprints outside Grauman's Chinese Theater. She has no memory and doesn't know who she is, and over the course of the film she tries to find out, meeting various local types - an old gent who knows Hollywood lore, a former starlet from the 1950s, a Scientologist and two women who wear superhero costumes for a living. The tone seems to be light and slightly exaggerated. Everyone the young amnesiac meets is a bit loud and strident, as though we're perceiving them through her hypersensitive consciousness.  Writer-director Steven Peros (who wrote the screenplay to The Cat's Meow) makes tangible the strange and vaporous quality that Hollywood has in real life - that of a town simultaneously in the past and present, caught between competing dreams and drab reality. He has made a good movie and, though I hope otherwise, this might be your one chance to see it.",1
"ROAD TO PERDITION: Drama. Starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, and Tyler Hoechlin. Directed by Sam Mendes. (R. 119 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Since day one this movie has been talked up as a departure for Hanks, in which he drops the nice-guy image and plays a hard case. That's almost true, but not quite. Hanks may play a hit man for a Depression-era Irish American mob, but he's a hit man who has his reasons. In a movie populated by immoral characters, he is the one who could most easily pass for a good guy. Still, the novelty of seeing Hanks as a 1930s mobster is enough for an audience to get a new angle on the actor, and that's not only fun but also revealing -- what's revealing is that he doesn't look ridiculous. Instead, in a fedora and a bulky overcoat, Hanks looks like a beefy tough guy. Not Luca Brasi tough, but tough enough. For this movie Hanks also changes his familiar voice into a gangster growl, the kind of voice we've heard in every other mob movie ever made. But here's the thing: Hanks doesn't just do the voice. He makes psychological sense of it. It's the voice of someone who knows he can't ever reveal his humanity, feelings or weaknesses. It's a voice with a clamp on it, a lonely person's voice. He plays Mike Sullivan, a strong-arm man for Rooney, a mob boss played by Paul Newman. It's 1931, the year of Little Caesar and The Public Enemy. A lot of people are on bread lines, but Mike, his wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two sons enjoy a cozy middle-class existence, thanks to Rooney, with whom Mike has a father-son relationship. One night Mike's comfortable but shaky existence is thrown forever off balance when he and Rooney's hotheaded son, Connor (Daniel Craig), go out on a job together. What's supposed to be a routine shakedown turns into a bloodbath. Characteristic of the movie's quiet intelligence is that we see the bloodbath in long shot, from a single setup that matches the angle from which an unseen witness sees it. The witness is Mike's oldest son, Michael (Tyler Hoechlin), and from there a series of catastrophes is set in motion that puts Mike on the outs with his mob and fleeing, with Michael, for his life. Newman, who has been playing too many crotchety geezers lately, finally gets a role that does justice to his gravity and presence. As Rooney, he's a picture of healthy old age, straight-backed and clear-eyed, but with the look of someone who has seen horrors. Like virtually everything else in Road to Perdition, not much is on the surface of Newman's performance. Yet every moment is alive with what's underneath it -- the weight of a misspent life, of guilt, of the certainty of damnation. These miseries of the spirit are what Rooney has passed on to Mike, and they're exactly what Mike doesn't want to pass on to Michael. Most of Road to Perdition takes place, appropriately enough, on the road, as Mike improvises a survival strategy and father and son slowly bond. The question What does a father owe a son? is ever-present, in the relationship of Connor and Rooney, Rooney and Mike, and Mike and Michael. The movie isn't so obvious as to offer a specific answer, because there isn't one. But the general idea is that the most important legacy is spiritual. The screenplay (adapted by David Self from Max Allan Collins' graphic novel) looks for ways to make minor characters distinct. A bodyguard, who appears on screen for a minute, becomes a specific person. Dylan Baker has a nice featured role as a mob accountant who appears also to be a gay aesthete. And the usually dashing Jude Law plays a perverse hit man with dirty fingers and bad teeth -- a role Steve Buscemi might have considered too unbecoming. Road to Perdition is a succession of fine scenes, most of them understated. Life-and-death conversations take place with no threats, as if the mobsters have all taken a course in management training. Yet always there's the gentle understanding that things can get very nasty indeed. Without doubt, this is an unusual way of doing a mob movie, and the results are not nearly as lovable as those of Coppola or Scorsese. Still, it never loses interest. Mendes pursues a completely different atmosphere, and he makes his movie work on his terms. . This film contains violence. ",1
"ROCK STAR: Comedy-drama. Starring Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. Directed by Stephen Herek. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Along the way, the picture hits every heavy-metal cliche, breathing life into most with the odd detail that lends authenticity: A dissipated rock star gets a complete blood transfusion backstage before an arena show; band members' wives ride in a limousine behind a tour bus while their husbands entertain groupies. Capturing the ridiculousness of heavy metal is easy. But to do it in a way that also conveys its grandeur, its moments of glory and its allure -- that takes work. Rock Star succeeds, not only thanks to Stephen Herek's direction and John Stockwell's screenplay, but by virtue of a soundtrack featuring good, loud music written for the movie. Then there's the cast. Mark Wahlberg, with that weird, complicated innocence he has, is ideal as Chris, an obsessive fan who sings in a tribute band and lives for his idols, the British rock group Steel Dragon. The sight of Wahlberg, with his wide-open face, jubilant and beaming at a Steel Dragon show, brings a mix of emotions. This is true love, so it's sweet. But he's in his mid-20s and he's worshiping nonsense, so it's pathetic. In fact, Chris is as pathetic as a guy can be and still have Jennifer Aniston for his girlfriend -- not too pathetic. This is Aniston's best role and her best movie. Previously, she played extensions of her TV personality, but here she gets to embody what her look suggests, a sort of platonic form of ideal girlfriend -- not just pretty, but wry, sharp, loyal. The director seems a bit nutty about her, throwing her as many loving close-ups as one might find in a '40s tearjerker. And the story, which is as much about relationships as it is about rock stardom, gives her plenty to act. Young Chris is minding his business one day, feeling like just another loser with big hair, when the phone rings, and it's the guitarist of Steel Dragon, offering him a plane ticket to Los Angeles. The band has seen a tape of one of his tribute-band performances, and they want him to audition to replace their lead singer. He lands the gig. Everything that pierces the barrier between his world and the world of his fantasies -- the limousine passing the rush of fans, the iron gates that open instead of staying shut, the first baby steps into a vision of luxury -- all come with a vicarious thrill. So this is what it's like. For the same reason, the first concert makes for an exciting scene. The lights go up, and we see what he sees: 20,000 people screaming and cheering. The bigness of it is awe-inspiring, but it also seems dangerous. Most people aren't built to withstand such adulation. That mixture of excitement and danger carries Rock Star a long way. When Chris and Emily (Aniston) go to their first after-the-show party, the barrage of temptations thrown at them becomes overwhelming -- the drugs, the sex, the ego massaging. It's relentless and insidious, and wisely the director doesn't have us observe it from an objective distance. He puts us right on the dance floor with Chris, Emily and some sexy, Eastern European rock temptress who is hot for both of them. That's it. Forget the promises they made. Welcome to the orgy. Rock Star doesn't tell the usual story about success going to a fellow's head. It's more subtle. It shows how the machinery of rock stardom makes anything like a normal life difficult, even impossible. A virtue of the movie is that, from the beginning, the audience is made to believe in and invest in Chris and Emily's relationship. The result is that, as soon Chris is a big shot, we actually worry about the couple. Timothy Spall has a key role as the band's road manager, who at first just seems like some sloppy, decadent creep. He emerges, ultimately, as a realist, who knows the world of heavy metal, knows how things happen, why they happen and why they can't change. Dance with the devil, and you're bound to trip over a big red tail. The movie skirts over some aspects of backstage life that we might have liked to see in detail, and Chris's journey as a character is sketchy in places. But it says something when a 108-minute movie seems 10 minutes short. Rock Star also gets a little cute near the finish, but there are worse things than cute. ",1
"Ray: Biographical drama. Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford. (PG-13. 153 minutes. At Bay Area theaters Foxx's complex performance and the filmmaker's willingness to look at the dark side place Ray safely out of the realm of typical Hollywood hagiography. The movie is too long by a good 30 minutes, and it becomes, for a time, a monotonous slog of club gigs and joyless womanizing. But, by the end, it's hard to imagine audiences really minding. This uncompromising movie's strengths are too undeniable and too rare to go unappreciated. Foxx not only captures the essence of Charles' exterior but suggests his psychological structure, as well. Acting is usually all about looking the other actor in the eye and responding honestly, but as Ray, Foxx has the handicap of having to act with eyes closed. He uses this to his advantage, suggesting that Ray's blindness contributed to an eerie distance in his personal dealings. At key moments, without looking perturbed or concerned -- as if almost muttering to himself -- Ray is shown cutting loved ones out of his life. He doesn't see the pained faces. It's just one less voice in the room. Ray's saving grace is his courage. When we meet him, he's 17 and getting on a bus to go from his hometown in Florida to Seattle, where he knows no one. If Ray is insular, it's because life has forced him into an inner attentiveness that doesn't let him drop his guard. On his first date with his future wife, he walks her home, then assures her he can make his way back because he has memorized how many blocks left and right he has to go to get to his hotel. Even as he's focused on the girlfriend, he's aware of every step. Throughout, the movie flashes back to Ray's childhood, a saga of Depression-era poverty and tragedy. When Ray's mother -- fiercely played by newcomer Sharon Warren -- realizes her son is going blind, she insists that the boy learn to be self-reliant. Warren's performance bursts with the pain, anger and hope of a mother who knows she can't protect her son against life and is determined to give him a fighting chance. As played by Warren, Ray's mother is an extraordinary woman who sets the pattern for the other women in Ray's life, all of them intense and passionate -- especially Della Bea (Kerry Washington), who becomes Ray's wife, and Margie Hendricks, a backup singer who serves as a kind of de facto wife for Ray when he's on the road. Though the elements are there -- success, drug abuse, redemption -- Ray doesn't conform to a neat VH1 Behind the Music structure. Ray's dependency on heroin settles in over a period of years, concurrent with his gradual rise to fame. His womanizing is instinctive and remorseless. There's really no neat pattern to Ray's life, and the movie is right not to impose one. Yet after a while there's a sameness: Same drugs, same women, same problems. When, two hours and 20 minutes into the film, it's still only 1965, Ray begins to feel like a story told in real time. Yet even during its weakest stretch (about two-thirds in), there's always the music. Ray is not just for fans of Ray Charles, but for everyone. Director Taylor Hackford turns the creation of Charles' signature song, What'd I Say, during a nightclub jam session, into an exhilarating sequence. Likewise, we're made to feel the excitement of Charles' early musical experiments, his fusion of gospel and blues in songs such as I Got a Woman and Mary Ann. Even people previously indifferent to Charles will come away with an increased appreciation and understanding of his work. They still might not understand him, but that won't be the movie's fault. Ray Charles was an enigma. He kept his distance, kept his dignity and saved a little something of himself for his music. -- Advisory: This film contains adult situations and scenes of drug use. ",1
"Rendition: Drama. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Omar Metwally, Meryl Streep and Jake Gyllenhaal. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Meryl Streep is the villain of Rendition, the head of the CIA who approves the transporting of a falsely accused terror suspect to Egypt, to be tortured on behalf of the United States. As she often is, Streep is a lesson in acting. Seeing her, we never really think, There's the head of the CIA. We think, There's Meryl Streep. Look at her go. As with Olivier, we never forget who it is we're watching, and our enjoyment of the performance details - the assumed Southern accent, the air of complacent superiority - is informed by our conscious enjoyment both of Streep's craft and our knowledge that she's  enjoying herself, too. We relax, confident that we're in the presence of a master storyteller. When we see Streep, we know she's going to tell us a great story about a certain kind of person. By contrast, with Reese Witherspoon in Rendition, we can't relax. Cast against type, she plays the pregnant wife of the terror suspect, but she has the chiseled face of a comedienne in a role that's lushly emotional. Witherspoon can do steely, and she can do hurt, but she can't go to that place of unimaginable sadness. And to watch her try is to get a little nervous for her, probably because she can't relax, either. We root for her, rather than ease into the spectacle.  Rendition is a maddening film, maddening in a good way, but maddening nonetheless. That it's embarrassingly plausible, that it depicts things that have happened and that are probably still happening, is enough to make Americans sick to their stomach. At the same time, it's no propaganda piece and makes no attempt to whitewash the freaky and frightening nature of radical Islam. The depiction of a madrassa, with scenes of young Muslim men being indoctrinated and prodded into murderous violence, is flat-out scary. But it would be a mistake to approve or reject Rendition on the basis of what it has to say. Its virtue is rather that it takes something very topical - the American policy of extraordinary rendition (an Orwellian name that evokes Judy Garland more than torture chambers) - and turns it into a gripping drama. A man disappears. With the government hiding him, how can his wife find him? And under the circumstances, how can he prove his innocence? Stripped naked and thrown into a dungeon, anyone would look guilty.  Witherspoon struggles and hangs on in a role that mainly consists of banging her head against a bureaucratic wall, but the film plays out on a wide canvas, and most of it doesn't follow her. In fact, a good deal of it takes place in a torture cell. It's a remarkable role for American Conservatory Theater alum Omar Metwally, as the innocent victim. In virtually every scene, he has to go to the outer edge of human experience. He responds with a career-making performance. He's well paired opposite Jake Gyllenhaal as an emotionally shut-down C.I.A. agent. As underplayed as the role is, Gyllenhaal suggests a specific and eccentric inner life and furnishes an emotionally legible arc. The repetitive nature of some of the action may put off some viewers. At times it's as if the story draws to a halt, but that strategy serves a purpose - to make audiences feel the hopelessness of the circumstances. The options are meager, and anyone who tries to help has to contend with the shark played by Streep, who loves power and is radiantly sure of her own virtue. Through the film, South African director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) films the action with a vigorous (but not shaking) camera that suggests a cold, observant intelligence moving through and encircling the characters, shaping their lives from a distant remove. It's a subtle thing, but it creates a mood of unease that pervades the movie and adds to its effectiveness. -- Advisory: Scenes of violence, torture and nudity.",1
"Resurrecting the Champ: Drama. Starring Josh Hartnett, Samuel L. Jackson, Alan Alda and Kathryn Morris. Directed by Rod Lurie. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and show times, and to buy tickets to select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Rod Lurie's movies invariably say something more than they seem to be saying. The Contender seemed to say that a candidate's private life was of no relevance, and then implied otherwise. Deterrence presented a president as a decisive leader, then suggested he was a fascist monster. And The Last Castle, about a general who leads a prison uprising, was either about heroes fighting tyranny - or about the dangerous cult of personality that can form around a charismatic leader. Resurrecting the Champ, a fictionalized drama based on fact, takes the form of a story about a journalist who comes to learn about life, love and writing by doing a story about a homeless man. But it could just as easily be described as a movie about a man with little character who learns how to scam the system. Resurrecting the Champ is enjoyable in the moment, even for people who really don't want to see Samuel L. Jackson going around with a shopping cart and eating out of garbage pails. But it's the complexity of Lurie's moral universe that makes it linger in the mind. Set in the newspaper world, it features Josh Hartnett as a young sportswriter in Denver, whose editor (Alan Alda) tells him, I forget your articles as I'm reading them. His estranged wife, who is about seven or eight years his senior, is a respected writer at the paper, and the impression - though never stated - is that he got the job through her. We learn a lot about Erik (Hartnett) just from the way Kathryn Morris, who plays the estranged wife, looks at him. She looks at him as if he's a lousy writer and he's lousy because there's something flawed in his character. He blots out whatever truths he doesn't like. Shrewdly, the screenplay, by Michael Bortman and Allison Burnett, shows Erik having conversations and then later describing those conversations - and each time his description doesn't match up with reality. He has a character problem, and yet the movie never confirms that by having some unimpeachable voice of authority state it. Nor does it present him as a complete loser. Erik is devoted to his wife. He has generous impulses. He just seems unformed. He stumbles onto a good story when he finds a major boxing attraction of the 1950s living on the street. Through a combination of small bribes and manipulation (and genuine interest and concern), he persuades the man to open up and tell his story. He sees the champ as his ticket to the big leagues, maybe television. What follows is a bumpy ride, filled with moral predicaments. Erik is the sort of complicated, ambiguous protagonist you'd find in a European film, and Hartnett responds with his best performance to date. Morris leaves a lasting impression as the wife, and Alda is strong as Erik's weary, disgusted boss. Generally, in any Samuel Jackson movie he steals the show, but this time he's saddled with an unflattering role. The fun of watching Jackson is watching him think, but here he's playing a man whose mind is half gone. Jackson conveys that as well as one could hope, but he's boxing with one hand and four fingers tied behind his back. -- Advisory: Adult situations, mild violence, strong language.",1
"Right before going to sleep tonight, imagine that instead of lying in bed,  you’re balanced on a thick cable, over a 1,350-foot drop. Imagine that you’re looking up into the sky, when a bird comes swooping down toward you. Imagine looking at the bird, while trying to keep your balance, and then think about how you’re going to stand up again without falling.If just the thought of this makes the back of your legs tingle, then get ready for the exquisite agony of “The Walk.” The film re-creates the high-wire walk between the twin towers of New York’s World Trade Center by Philippe Petit in 1974. The 24-year-old French aerialist had planned the crossing for as long as eight years, and once he made it to the other side, he decided he liked it so much that he went back out for a total of 45 minutes. As crowds below cheered him on, he walked on the wire, knelt on it and even lay down.Petit’s feat was the subject of an excellent documentary, “Man on Wire” (2008), but here’s the thing about documentaries: They’re about other people. Narrative features are about you. That is, if they’re done well — and “The Walk” is done beautifully — they create a powerful confusion in the mind, so that the protagonist’s experience feels like your own.“The Walk” does this. In fact, I’ll just say it: I don’t think I’ve ever been more physically  affected by a movie. (I’m not talking about emotions, just physical damage.) After two hours of “The Walk,” I felt  as if I’d walked the wire myself. I was agitated and exhausted. During the movie, I was squirming and wincing, and a few times even had to close my eyes, just to find some relief. Hours later, this was followed by the obligatory nightmare. And even now, thinking about the movie...“The Walk” doesn’t tap into the fear of heights, which not everyone has, so much as the fear of falling, which is universal. In this, the 3-D process becomes central. Robert Zemeckis directed, and he is one of the few filmmakers to use the 3-D process with thought and artistry. In his hands, it’s neither a gimmick nor an afterthought, but something enmeshed within a complete vision.Petit wasn’t Evel Knievel, after all, not a straight-up daredevil. He saw crossing between the towers as primarily a work of art, and Zemeckis, presenting the action from Petit’s point of view, never forgets that. In one of the key moments, Petit has one foot on the building and the other on the wire, and the space in between the buildings is covered in clouds. But when he lifts his foot off the building and commits himself to the wire, the clouds fall away, and everything is clear.Based on Petit’s memoir (yes, he’s alive), the film is presented as a recollection, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt narrating, sometimes in voice-over, but often directly to the audience. Gordon-Levitt adopts a French accent, which he attacks with precision and gusto, and within 10 seconds viewers won’t think it odd to hear him talking like that. It pays to just do something and not be shy about it.The screenplay is not particularly introspective with regard to Petit’s psychology — the question “What’s wrong with that guy?” is never answered. Nor does it adequately convey the wire-walking expertise that Petit had developed in the years leading up to his twin towers walk. The movie is very good, however, on the caper aspect. Just to get the rigging to the roof and set it up took years of planning, study and stealth, not to mention lots of luck. In a way, Petit was in more danger before he stepped out onto the wire. Once he did, he was a hero. Before that moment, he might have gone to jail as a public nuisance.Incidentally, the movie becomes a memoir of the 1970s, a time at once more innocent and yet more daring, less fearful about breaking rules. No one watching Petit’s glorious stunt in 1974 ever dreamed that the buildings he crossed between were as vulnerable as he was, or that he would outlive them. This film couldn’t have been made 10 years ago. Just the sight of the towers would have been too upsetting. But enough time has  passed that we can now look back on this event as the other big thing that happened at the towers, the good thing.As we’ve come to expect from movies, even when we don’t get it, the technical aspects are handled here with a meticulousness bordering on the magical. The towers are re-created, and Gordon-Levitt really does seem to be 110 stories off the ground. Expect to be very worried about him. ",1
"Robert De Niro works a lot, and contrary to what some people like to say about his later career, he is always better, usually much better, than his roles require. But his showcases this century have not been ideal, a mix of big roles in weak movies, small roles in better films and other roles that are amusing, sometimes in a self-referential way, but that don’t allow him to grow.So “The Comedian” is something special, a good movie that gives one of our best actors a chance to show us something new and to remind us that the Robert De Niro story is not entirely written. He plays a once-successful comedian, and right away, the movie differentiates itself from just about every other movie with a comedian protagonist: De Niro is actually funny.This is important. Other movies about comedians fall down on this obvious requirement. (One example, of many: Jenny Slate in “Obvious Child.”) Some even resort to showing us the audience’s reaction in a nightclub as a way of telling us that the comedian is going over well. But in “The Comedian,” we always know how the comedian is doing. Sometimes he’s very funny, sometimes he’s mildly funny, and sometimes he’s on the edge of antagonizing and alienating his audience. His audience’s reactions are our reactions.This means that the screenwriters (there are four of them) either separately or collectively bothered to write good jokes, and that De Niro learned how to put them over. Being a stand-up comic is not the same as being a funny person or being able to act a comic part. It’s a separate skill, one that takes years to master. De Niro makes you believe he has mastered it.He’s in capable hands with Taylor Hackford as director. All the movie’s finer points — of audience response, of interaction, of the dances between people — are conveyed with a specificity so expert that it seems offhand. One good example comes in the first meeting between Jackie (De Niro) and Harvey Keitel, as the shady businessman father of a woman (Leslie Mann) Jackie knows.As the businessman, Keitel is a genuine fan of Jackie’s. He has seen every episode of “Eddie’s Home,” the 1980s sitcom that made Jackie famous. But the businessman is also a weird guy, with a hostile streak, so that even as he praises Jackie, he wants to slight him. He doesn’t like being in the lower-status position of fan. So the dynamic is odd, with lots of unacknowledged hostility, and very fluid, changing imperceptibly as the businessman’s anger goes from unconscious to conscious. In the end, it’s a simple scene, but the direction and the acting are so precise that it’s a minor thing of beauty.The cast is first-rate, probably because even the small roles are vivid: Danny DeVito as Jackie’s long-suffering brother; Patti LuPone as Jackie’s sister-in-law, who can barely contain her hatred of him — and then can’t contain it; Edie Falco as Eddie’s agent; Charles Grodin as a comedian from the old days; Cloris Leachman as a 95-year-old comic actress on her last legs; and several comedians, including Jimmie Walker and Brett Butler, as themselves.But special attention should be paid to Mann, who more than holds her own opposite De Niro. She creates a complex character, a woman with anger problems and father issues, but who’s better than her circumstances, who has warmth and a sense of fun. As she showed in “The Other Woman,” Mann has the rare capacity to behave in ways that are funny, absurd and extreme, yet still carry a movie’s emotion.“The Comedian” is the story of a comic’s career and of his personal life, and despite having been written by a committee of four, it has cohesion and the power to surprise. Of course, De Niro is the biggest surprise: Who knew he could do it? And who knew he could still do things no one knew he could do?",1
"Romance. Starring Daniel Auteuil, Astrid Berges-Frisbey and Nicolas Duvauchelle. Directed by Daniel Auteuil. (Not rated. 107 minutes.) The Well Digger's Daughter, despite the title, does not take place in a well, or in the dark, but in the green and golden expanses of rural Provence, circa 1914. It's the first film directed by the actor Daniel Auteuil, as part of a four-film project to remake films by the writer-director Marcel Pagnol, and if the others are this good, this is a project to look forward to. Pagnol is best known in the United States for writing the stories that were the basis of Claude Berri's 1986 masterpieces, Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring. The Well Diggers Daughter, although not quite in that class, is set in that same rural world, and it has the same way of sneaking up on the audience. What to our eyes looks small, placid and idyllic soon reveals itself as a place of grand passion and life-and-death struggle.  The Well Digger's Daughter is old-fashioned in the best sense, almost cozy in its conventions. In an early scene, Auteuil, who plays the local well digger, explains to one of his employees how he ended up the widowed father of five daughters and how one of them came to be educated in Paris. It's flat-out exposition - the guy he's talking to would probably know all this already - and yet something about Auteuil's approach feels tried and true, not tried and worn. The daughter from Paris, Patricia (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), is the well digger's favorite, and, hoping to keep her close to home, he encourages his slightly clownish colleague (Kad Merad) to court her. Meanwhile, Patricia is developing an interest in Jacques (Nicolas Duvauchelle), the elusive son of a wealthy merchant. And from that simple and rather stock situation, events of profound moment start to build. It's a good director who knows his actors' strengths, and it's an unusually smart actor who knows his own strengths well enough to direct himself. Auteuil has always excelled at playing men who are basically decent and yet flawed and limited. In the well digger, he finds a role that perfectly suits him, a character who is a mysterious amalgam of right and wrong ideas, odd prejudices and tender feelings, and so we watch him with interest at all times, wondering which way he'll eventually tilt. As Patricia, Berges-Frisbey is the film's warm and sympathetic focus, but Auteuil's appreciation of all the characters, in their fullness and truth, results in something rare: a movie that provokes an anxious and intense rooting interest without providing a single villain.",1
"Romantic comedy. Starring Leighton Meester, Hugh Laurie and Catherine Keener. Directed by Julian Farino. (R. 90 minutes.)There's something in the tone of The Oranges - something in the point of view, in the attitude toward the material - that feels a little too careful, safe and nice and, therefore, occasionally inauthentic. Yet the movie has a saving grace in that it breaks formula. Its concerns are not the usual movie concerns, and it takes what might have been a standard plot in some unexpected directions. It takes place in a suburban section of New Jersey known as the Oranges, where two couples in their early 50s are best of friends. Terry (Oliver Platt) and Carol (Allison Janney) live across the street from David (Hugh Laurie) and Paige (Catherine Keener) and spend all their holidays together. The movie presents the families' closeness in a light way that borders on mockery, and yet not to such a degree that we don't understand that this is actually a cozy and enriching thing in their lives. The story kicks in when Nina (Leighton Meester), the prodigal 24-year-old daughter of Terry and Carol, comes home after more than a year of traveling and, almost immediately, launches into an affair with David. But this is what's surprising: She neither seduces him (he makes the first move), nor does he exploit her. It's just something that happens, perhaps not the ideal thing or the moral thing, but not something out of left field, either. As much as this liaison violates every aspect of the two families' long-standing friendship, the affair also seems to be a kind of natural outgrowth of it. From there, The Oranges is not about the relationship between David and Nina, or even about David's marriage and what he should or shouldn't do. It remains the story of those two families, of that friendship, and about the ripples that form when the pebble of adultery is dropped into that smooth pond.  The treatment is not as sophisticated as one might hope, but it is in itself sophisticated that the movie removes itself from moral judgment and just examines the interpersonal dynamics in an honest way. This leads to conflicts but also to unexpected and effective moments of tenderness between various characters.  Laurie and Platt stand out, in particularly, because their roles are well written, and we know who they are and what they care about. The women, less understood by the screenwriters, fare less well, though Leighton Meester succeeds in embodying all that is alluring and alarming about a 24-year-old woman, at least from the standpoint of a middle-aged man.",1
"Romantic drama. Starring Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve and Ludivine Sagnier. Directed by Christophe Honoré. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 139 minutes.) Writer-director Christophe Honoré has made some truly awful films (Making Plans for Lena, Love Songs, Ma Mere), but with Beloved he has made a very good one that, oddly enough, has many resemblances to his bad ones. It's as if he has been trying to express something, or to make his own particular kind of good movie, for 10 whole years. Now he has.  All the hallmarks of Honoré's worst work are here: In Beloved, characters have a way of breaking into song during key moments of reflection or communication, and the songs aren't particularly good. The movie contains turns of plot that are beyond unlikely, that are more on the order of arbitrary, and the characters have a strange amorality, which the director either fails to recognize or doesn't think worth acknowledging. Yet this time those elements are accompanied by a vision of something grand in life, of great emotions and movements, of time and generations. Beloved has a big spirit and, somewhere along the line, it becomes a big film. Ludivine Sagnier starts things off as Madeleine, an acquisitive young woman who stumbles into prostitution and, just as easily, stumbles out of it when she meets a man she likes, Jaromil (Radivoje Bukvic), a handsome Czechoslovakian doctor. Their steamy relationship spans decades, so that in later years Catherine Deneuve plays the older Madeleine and Milos Forman plays Jaromil. Chiara Mastroianni, Deneuve's real-life daughter, plays Madeleine's daughter, who falls in love with an American (Paul Schneider), who has everything going for him as a potential boyfriend, except that he's gay.  Those are the two main story lines, both sagas of passion and mixed luck, expressed through vivid incidents and indifferent music. But here is what's interesting: About 80 minutes in, the movie begins to feel like an uncommonly nourishing meal. The beginning of the film will seem like a long time ago. Beloved achieves the difficult thing of making an audience experience the expanse of time, the passage of many years. By the time that Deneuve, who has deservedly become a universally recognized symbol of French womanhood, meets up with Sagnier in a fantasy sequence in which she encounters her earlier self, there's no doubting that Honoré has attempted and pulled off something quite special, powerful and really touching. Not all of Beloved is pitched on that level. Honoré can be irritating, and anyone who attends this film should be prepared to meet him halfway. This is not for you if you're feeling tired or impatient. Beloved is a flower that opens, not just gradually, but in fits and starts. But it opens. It gets there. And the women - Sagnier, Deneuve, Mastroianni - are pretty wonderful.",1
"Romantic drama. Starring John Livingston and Sabrina Lloyd. Directed by Mark Decena. (R. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Director Mark Decena, who co-wrote the film with Timothy Breitbach, is in search of beauty with this story, and everything that's special about Dopamine proceeds from that search, that willingness of the heart. Decena finds the inner beauty in the somewhat squalid rituals of modern romance and in his flawed but striving characters. The film is set in San Francisco, which is always fun, and this time it's even interesting because for once we don't get the San Francisco of painted ladies, cable cars and ocean views. John Livingston plays Rand, a computer designer working with two colleagues in a dingy loft. One night, after knocking off work, Rand and a co-worker go to a bar, where they meet a young woman, Sarah (Sabrina Lloyd), who signals an interest in Rand. But he's too slow and too shy to respond -- his tongue-tied reticence is wisely not played for laughs but for the painful thing it truly is -- and so the moment is lost. There's a nice inner quiet about Livingston and a sexy inner turmoil about Lloyd that makes an audience want to see the characters they play get together. But before that can happen, there is stuff that must be overcome, emotional baggage, silly notions and past traumas that have either to be discarded or worked through. Rand is dealing with the ongoing pain of a mother with Alzheimer's and -- as a means of coping with the unbearable -- has adopted a mechanistic view of human interaction. For Rand, all emotions have a chemical component, even a chemical origin: Joan of Arc was prone to epileptic seizures, he says. Rand has memorized the chemicals, determined to distance himself from his anguish. In the process, he has set up a barrier against anyone who wants to get close. Livingston is a pleasure to watch, lumpy and humble-looking one minute, sly and handsome the next, and always full of feeling. Lloyd brings fierceness and integrity to her role, as well as dark, searching eyes. She plays Sarah as completely self-assured and almost as completely screwed up, a combination that's repellent in men but that women can wear gracefully. Though Sarah seems grounded, she is driven to extreme behavior by a secret sorrow she can't shake. Dopamine is a low-budget film, rough in its look but mostly graceful in its execution. The storytelling is too sincere to be smooth and for brief moments can seem clumsy, but no one will watch the movie filling out a scorecard. The main thing, the only thing, is that Decena hooks us with these characters from the start and makes us believe in their pain and longing. Though cool in its presentation, Dopamine is a passionate film that's sure to inspire passion in its audience. - This film contains strong language, sexual situations and drug use. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy-horror. Starring Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis. Directed by Don Coscarelli. (R. 92 minutes. At the Castro.) If the weather is clear this Halloween, chances are good some kid will show up on your doorstep with a better costume than the mummy in Bubba Ho-Tep. The movie, starring cult film demigod Bruce Campbell as a rest home Elvis Presley and Ossie Davis as his neighbor who thinks he's John F. Kennedy, isn't particularly successful as a laugh-out-loud comedy, either. But Bubba Ho-Tep is surprisingly good as a quirky triumph of human spirit. Made with a budget that looks as if it could be trumped by a single episode of Charmed, this amusing film by director Don Coscarelli is worth a mainstream look before it settles into the B-movie horror discount section at the local video store. Bubba Ho-Tep begins with Presley in a dingy Texas rest home, where he watches the slow hacking-cough death of his roommate. Obsessed about his lack of sexual drive and various personal ailments, the King sits in bed and waits for his turn. At the same time, a soul-sucking Egyptian mummy is unleashed down the hall in another oldster's room. The rest of the movie follows the walker-assisted hero's journey as Presley and Kennedy confront the demon. Campbell (The Evil Dead) puts forth a humorous yet only passable Presley imitation. But he is convincing as a foulmouthed old warrior who finds his youth when faced with one last battle. Coscarelli wisely lingers on Presley's suffering in the early scenes, confining the camera's point of view to his bed. When the creaky rock star finally springs into action, it's more rousing than most battles in summer action movies with 20 times the budget. Davis is less effective as a wheelchair-ridden Robin to Campbell's Batman. Also, the slow pace of the movie's main characters combined with the bargain- bin special effects make for a strange finale. But it's also an oddly touching finale. Campbell's followers will find the cult actor in top form in Bubba Ho-Tep, and he may win over a few new fans as well. This film contains violence and explicit adult language. -- Peter Hartlaub Documentary. Directed by Paul Devlin. (Not rated. 85 minutes. In English and Georgian with English subtitles. At the Roxie through Thursday.). Before the U.S.S.R. collapsed, the citizens of Soviet Georgia never paid for electricity. Today, an American multinational, Applied Energy Services (AES), is regulating utilities for the capital city of Tbilisi, population 1.2 million, where the typical utility bill runs $24 and monthly incomes average $15 to $75. New York documentarian Paul Devlin finds a city in chaos, with politicians lying, enraged people stealing power and AES employees gloating over creepy methods of scaring consumers into paying delinquent bills. It's a bleak picture, symbolized by the illegal wires and cables, frayed and stripped of insulation, that snake through the city's tenements. Devlin tells his story without bias but with shards of gallows humor, finding a central figure in Piers Lewis, the British-born strategic projects director for AES. A vagabond who lived in the United States and Central America before Georgia, Lewis speaks fondly of the exotic mystery of Tbilisi, making us believe that he has the best interests of the Georgian people in mind. But it's his job to enforce payment from consumers, and when AES gathers a 10 percent payment rate, the gloves come off. Power is disconnected, angry citizens revolt, and Lewis vows not to cut his hair until collection rates reach 50 percent. It's Akaki Gogichaishvili, a Georgian broadcast journalist, who best describes the incursion of AES and its hard-line policy: If you don't have power it means you are hungry, you are cold. You're in the dark. No information. It's like being dead. Electricity is very much connected with the hope in human nature, says another journalist, Leeka Basilaia. It's difficult to understand for people who are living in the 'civilized world.'  -- Edward Guthmann Drama. Starring Oren Rehany, Tchelet Semel, Saul Stein. Directed and written by Eitan Gorlin. (Not rated. 96 minutes. At the Lumiere and Shattuck in Berkeley.). Let's start with the title. The Holy Land is the wrong banner for a movie about a young Orthodox Jew who falls for a fiery, red-haired prostitute. If you're going to make a quasi-relationship movie set in Israel that has pretensions of being a parable (people stray from their faith/roots, debate whether to return, etc.), how about something that at least alludes to the film's libido-driven undercurrent -- like Red Light in Tel Aviv? Instead, the generic nature of The Holy Land ill-prepares audiences for scenes of masturbation (though tastefully done), bare-breasted strippers sliding around poles and entangled lovers moaning and writhing. Beyond this, there's the film's overall aesthetic. Eitan Gorlin's first feature tries to be serious and absurd (mostly, it's a drama) but never finds a good rhythm. The movie flounders in a way that calls too much attention to itself -- and is hurt by jarring and unbelievable plot twists. On a positive note, Gorlin deserves credit for creating a boy-meets-girl story set in an Israel where Jews and Arabs, religious and nonreligious, commingle (even if they distrust each other). The scenes of Mendy (the Orthodox Jew), Sasha (the prostitute from Russia) and Mike (an American who owns a bar) walking through the old markets of Jerusalem or on hilly plateaus are interesting in themselves. And the melange of languages (most of the characters use English, but Hebrew and Arabic are also spoken) makes for an aural treat. None of this, however, is really enough to save The Holy Land, which is too bad. The intersection of religion and sexual desire is an interesting subject that other artists have explored, including author Nathan Englander. (The title story of Englander's For the Relief of Unbearable Urges has a premise that's remarkably similar to that in The Holy Land.) It's easy to understand why Gorlin wanted to make this movie. A lapsed Orthodox Jew who studied in America and Israel, he once worked at a Jerusalem bar, where he witnessed a potpourri of people who drank heavily and talked unabashedly. He even wrote a novella about his experiences. Some topics, however, are probably better left on the printed page. . This film contains some strong language, nudity and sex scenes. -- Jonathan Curiel ",1
"Romantic drama. Starring Katie Aselton and Dax Shepard. Directed by Katie Aselton. (R. 77 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) I'd rather talk to you about The Freebie after you've seen it - there's a lot to discuss - but since we can't do that here, let me give you three tips on how to better enjoy this movie. First, assume you're in good hands. You are. Katie Aselton, who is married to Mark Duplass of the Duplass brothers, has made a film in their style: handheld cameras, kitchen-sink and pillow-talk conversations, and lots of people calling each other dude. It's so seemingly raw and offhand that you might feel as though you're ahead of it, or you might be tempted to think that Aselton is willing to settle for something easy and glib. Forget it. Relax. Second, don't expect something all that funny. It's about a husband and wife in their 30s (Aselton and Dax Shepard) who get along fine but the thrill is gone. So they get the idea to pump things up in their marriage by setting aside one day in which they're free to have sex with someone else. Obviously, the situation has the makings of a weak gimmick comedy (like Hump Day), but Aselton doesn't take it there.  Third, notice how uncomfortable many of the scenes in Freebie make you feel, like you don't know how to react, like one thing seems to be happening, but you're feeling something else. That's how you're supposed to feel. In an early scene, Annie (Aselton) and Darren (Shepard) are at a small dinner party, and the conversation sends Darren on a riff about how promiscuous he would be if he weren't married. The scene lands in the same zone as it would in life, in any uneasy place between mildly amusing and too-much-information. The people in The Freebie like to talk. They are in touch with their feelings, or think they are. They are therapy savvy, self-analytical and know their way around psychological jargon. Listen to them, and you'll hear the voice of our times. Yet, for all this, they communicate no more than their parents. Their words are dense smoke screens. We hear what they're saying and know what they really mean, even when they don't. Such complexity in the dialogue is a major accomplishment, and also a victory of technique in that Aselton worked off no set screenplay but encouraged her actors to improvise. Still, the improvisations must have taken place within a tightly controlled plot outline, because no movie this subtle comes about by accident. Nobody could ever be that lucky. Neither can it ever arrive by careful editing of random nonsense. Edit a mountain of garbage and all you get is a hill of garbage. But very little here is filler. Actually, here's a fourth tip: Don't watch The Freebie thinking that Annie and Darren are supposed to be emblematic of most young couples seven years into a marriage. There's a tendency to think that, a consequence of the movie's telling us too little about them. (We never know, for example, what they do for a living.) In fact, this couple's problems are special and, at least to this viewer, far worse than they think. Aselton, who was the best thing in the Duplass debut, The Puffy Chair, is an actress capable of expressing complicated and conflicted emotional states and of taking us into her thoughts. She's brilliant. She also has someone smart working the camera for her, because in the midst of group scenes, the frame has a way of capturing crucial but subtle reactions, the interior moments unseen by friends.  Aselton gets a lot said in 78 minutes. I think the main thing she says is something never overtly spoken, that life is essentially a lonely experience - even when we're surrounded by activity, and even if we never shut up. -- Advisory: Strong language, sexual situations.",1
"Romántico: Documentary. With Carmelo Muñiz Sanchez and Arturo Arias. Directed by Mark Becker. (Not rated. 80 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.)  [Podcast: Mick LaSalle talks Romantico and Samoan Wedding.] You ever go to a restaurant and see two guys walk in with guitars and start singing Mexican songs? And you think, Oh, no. Not only do I have to get tortured listening to music I don't want to hear, and not only has dinner conversation come to a standstill, but I'm even going to have to pay for the privilege when they pass around the hat. No? You never think that? Well, then you're one of the nice people and have nothing to learn from this movie. The picture is about two guys from Mexico, illegal immigrants, talented musicians and singers who are making their living in precisely this way: They go from restaurant to restaurant in San Francisco, doing a small set of songs and earning tips. On a weeknight, they might make $30 each. On a weekend, they can make between $50 and $100. During the day, they have other jobs. One works in a car wash. These are men in their 50s who were born poor and are probably going to die poor, but they're working like pack animals to give their families in Mexico a leg up in life. The film follows Carmelo Sanchez, the romántico of the title, who has two daughters, and the nightmare that he has is that one or both of them might end up so poor they turn to prostitution. To prevent that, he works in the United States in a kind of exile, staying away for months and even years at a time. The film touches on the terrible loneliness of this exile, and then follows Sanchez back home to Mexico. He's there for his mother's final illness and then lingers there, reluctant to go back. Earlier, someone warns him against returning home, that it makes coming back to the United States all the more harsh -- not that the Americans are nasty, just that America isn't home. In Mexico, Sanchez continues his life as a musician, but he makes a 10th of what he can make in San Francisco. Romántico would be nothing if it were just a hard-luck story. The movie is something else: the revelation of a way of life, of a whole area of human experience going on right under our noses -- or standing over our restaurant tables. More than that, it's an encounter with a special man. Sanchez has wisdom, humility and devoutness, and he's a real artist. Maybe we've seen him before, but without director Mark Becker we'd have never gotten to know him. -- Advisory: Adult themes. ",1
"Runaway Jury: Drama. Starring John Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman. Directed by Gary Fleder. (PG-13. 127 minutes. At Bay area theaters.) At first, this seems like a mild frustration, but it's a virtue in disguise, in that it serves to keep us guessing. After all, with a movie like this, knowing who we want to win is really the same as knowing who will win. With Runaway Jury, we know nothing except that we're off balance, and we're interested. Based on the novel by John Grisham, the picture is masterfully plotted, though a bit obvious in its writing, with dialogue that sometimes clunks and scenes supposedly dynamic and convincing that often fall short. Yet the movie is so entertaining and its world so sneaky and remarkable -- jury rooms, back alleys, offshore banks -- that it seems churlish to quibble. Runaway Jury hooks the audience, and after 10 minutes there's no looking back. The film marks the first time that veterans (and former New York roommates) Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman have appeared together onscreen -- Hackman as a sleazy expert in jury selection and Hoffman as a virtuous New Orleans attorney on the other side of the aisle. But the movie really belongs to John Cusack and Rachel Weisz as Nick and Marlee, who cook up a scheme to gain sway over a jury and sell its verdict to the highest bidder. Runaway Jury presents a nightmare scenario in which the defense in a multimillion-dollar civil case mounts a campaign to know the life history of every prospective juror. Illegal surveillance and bugging are used, and investigators are employed to dig up dirt that can be used to blackmail jurors into voting a certain way. As the shiny-suited shark played by Hackman says, Trials are too important to be left up to juries. A maniac has gone wild and killed 11 people in a law office, and now a year later a widow is suing the gun manufacturer. The gun tycoons are presented as scheming old reprobates with everything but horns growing out of their heads, but before we can begin to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit, the movie concentrates on Nick and Marlee's drama. He gets on the jury, while she works the outside, trying to get representatives of both sides into a bidding war. Cusack and Weisz both have a doe-eyed appeal, and so we find ourselves in the odd position of almost wanting them to get away with their scam. Hoffman as a Southern gentleman is hardly ideal casting, but there are some nice Hoffmanesque moments that make it worth enduring his wobbly Louisiana accent. When Marlee makes her pitch for money, Hoffman asks, Who hurt you? What made you this way? He says it with a disarming simplicity and feeling that cut to the heart of the moment. Hackman is more at the film's center, confident, twinkling, amoral, the picture of white-collar corruption. He and Hoffman exchange lines in only a single scene, set in a courthouse men's room, in which their characters square off. The scene has the feel of a set piece, an encounter made necessary by the stature of the actors but superfluous to the story, and there's a whiff of Fred and Ginger dancing in The Barkleys of Broadway about it -- two people, aware of their own and each other's legends, serving up a jewel for audiences to marvel at. Still, it's entertaining to see them, even if their scene might have been more fun to watch had director Gary Fleder given them an occasional two-shot in which both their faces could be seen at once -- and the difference in their physical stature (one tall, one short) could be emphasized. Instead, he gets fancy, so that most of the time, at least one actor has his back to the camera. Fortunately, for the most part Fleder is not so self-conscious, and Runaway Jury is smoothly shot, slick in the way of modern suspense thrillers. Advisory: This film contains violence. ",1
"Russell Crowe’s feature directorial debut, “The Water Diviner,” is a somber historical fiction about the aftermath of World War I’s Gallipoli Campaign, and everyone in it looks haunted and humbled. We will never know what they were like before the war, before they knew better, before they knew how vulnerable they were and before they knew to think less highly of themselves. Crowe’s direction captures this mood across all the performances — of people damaged yet elevated, transformed against their will.The movie comes together from several directions and takes time to cohere, but it builds scene by scene to a tense emotional place. It begins behind Turkish lines in the last battle of the campaign, then shifts to Australia four years later and to the sight of a man trying to find a source of water for his dusty farm. We soon discover that this man, Joshua Connor (Crowe), lost three sons at Gallipoli and that his wife has gone mad from grief. As was the case for so many Great War casualties, the sons’ remains were never located.“The Water Diviner,” based on the novel by Andrew Anastasios and Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios, tells the story of Connor’s journey to Istanbul and Gallipoli and of his efforts to find his sons’ bodies and return them to Australia. Australia is brown and dusty, but Istanbul is color, street life, the Blue Mosque and the call to prayer. As for Gallipoli, it’s a study in contrasts. Turn one way, and the sea views are stunning: It looks like a great place to build a high-end resort. Look the other way, and it’s absolute desolation, a thin cover of wreckage over a mass grave.Of course, as a civilian, Connor can’t get near anything, but there is something about him that’s too substantial to dismiss. He doesn’t seem like a man who will be dissuaded or who should be dissuaded. Here, again, Crowe shows that he’s an intelligent director of himself. His aura of purpose and seriousness isn’t overplayed, and his character is hardly irresistible to everyone. But we do believe in his essential depth, brought about by suffering, which others in the same condition can perceive. One of those people is Maj. Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), the commander who won the battle but lost the war and is now assisting his former adversaries in locating the bodies. It’s hard to say, exactly, what it is that Erdogan does, what it is about this Turkish actor that allows us to read worlds of insight into his stillness — but he is remarkable, either a great actor or a gifted presence, or both. The emerging connection between Connor and the man who may be responsible for the death of his sons is one of the film’s deepening riches. The other is Connor’s gradually increasing affection for Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), a widow who lost her husband at Gallipoli and now runs the hotel in which Connor stays. Kurylenko has been largely unchallenged in her screen career, either decorative or, as in “To the Wonder,” a pawn in a director’s grand design. Crowe gives her room to breathe. He makes her at least an equal in their two-person encounters, and she emerges as a leading lady of intelligence and force.“The Water Diviner” is not the easiest movie to love, with its somber atmosphere and unwelcome movements back and forth from the postwar period back to the war. But it’s an easy film to respect and, as it plays on, to care about and enjoy. It should be said that the battle scenes are uncompromising in their grimness: A split-second sight of a soldier trembling after his legs are blown off lingers in the mind. Crowe is not messing around here, not trying to dream up opportunities to throw himself another close-up. He’s a genuine director.",1
"SHREK: Animation. Starring (the voices of) Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson. (PG, 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is not just a matter of technology. Shrek is a visual marvel, but these days most animations qualify as technological breakthroughs. If they're good, they are the last word until the next word, which usually comes along in a month or two. Shrek is modern in its sensibility. A beautiful princess sings to a bird in a tree -- and just as the audience is flashing back to similar cloying moments in Disney movies (Disney being the archrival of this film's distributor, DreamWorks) -- something wonderful happens. The princess hits a high note, and the strain causes the bird to explode. It's at this point we become sure, if we weren't already, that this is one animated film not written by recluses who spend all day drawing pictures and listening to Elton John scores. Shrek may exist in a fantasy world, but it's a product of an attitude grounded in our world. Though at its core it's more honest and warmhearted than most animated films, its surface is brittle, smart and occasionally caustic. The title character is a big green ogre, who lives by himself in the woods. Mike Myers, speaking with a vague Scottish accent, brings wit and sensitivity to his vocal characterization of a gentle fellow who doesn't want to know anybody, mainly because people have a way of screaming in his presence. Against his will, however, he finds himself befriended by a donkey -- a little motor-mouth played by Eddie Murphy. Shrek is a fairy tale and a send-up of fairy tales that works in both ways. One morning our hero goes outside to find his land has been invaded by dispossessed fairy tale characters: the Three Bears, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and others. An evil lord (the voice of John Lithgow) is ridding his land of them. Indeed, this lord is so evil he even dismembers the Gingerbread Man, whose high-pitched screams are reminiscent of those of Mr. Bill, the much- abused Saturday Night Live clay character from years ago. Shrek makes a deal with the lord. In exchange for getting his own land back, Shrek will rescue a princess trapped in a tower so the lord can marry her. Most of the picture is made up of this adventure, Shrek and the donkey's journey to the tower and back with the princess (the voice of Cameron Diaz). The visuals are impressive when looked at objectively. But the glory of Shrek is that the visuals are used in the service of scenes exciting enough that no viewer would have the impulse to sit around making objective judgments. The scene in which Shrek and the donkey cross a rickety bridge, hanging over a roiling, cascading pit of red lava, is not just pretty. It's as gripping as the best scene in a good action movie. The same can be said for the sequence involving a fire-spouting female dragon. The visual elegance is not limited to spectacle. Facial expressions are rendered with detail and subtlety of feeling. In another film, Murphy's mile-a- minute patter as the donkey might have become irritating, but he can't be irritating because the donkey is too much the strutting little guy to be anything but cute. Plus, we see his face. We see his insecurity, his thoughts, what he's trying to cover, what he can't but reveal. This is beautiful work. Parents by now are used to the fact that animated films are generally made for children, with a few arch cultural references thrown in to keep adults from going into a cataleptic seizure. But Shrek works just as well for adults as kids. Its sweetness of spirit is real, but it's balanced by an anarchic streak. Just one example of anarchy: Shrek, to impress the princess, inflates a frog with air and presents it to her as a balloon. The princess, in turn, blows air into a snake and makes a balloon sculpture out of it. Behind the absurd cruelty is the idea that Shrek and the princess are barely civilized woods creatures. Only once does Shrek cross the line. Some parents may not want their children to hear Joan Jett on the soundtrack singing about how she doesn't give a damn about her bad reputation. But that's pretty mild, and aside from that, Shrek is as innocent as a Disney movie -- and a lot more entertaining. ",1
"SIMONE: Sci-fi comedy. Starring Al Pacino, Catherine Keener and Rachel Roberts. Directed by Andrew Niccol. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture stars Al Pacino, and that's always good. Actually, it's better than good here because in Simone we get Pacino in his full flailing, flustered mode. He plays an artistically high-minded director named Taransky, whose career has been derailed by selfish actors and a trail of red ink on the books. I'm not interested in investment and return! I'm making a movie! Al Pacino yells in the picture's first minutes. Right there we know: Simone is going to be a lot of fun. Taransky is washed up in Hollywood. He has a movie that's almost completed, but his star (Winona Ryder) has walked out on him, and his studio -- in the form of his ex-wife and boss (Catherine Keener) -- has pulled the plug on the project. Seemingly nothing can save him, and then one day a package arrives, a bequest from a mad inventor (Elias Koteas). It's a computer hard drive containing the technology to digitally fabricate a film actress and insert her into a movie. Out of the computer database, the director assembles a digital actress, a tall, thin blonde with a somber air, played by Rachel Roberts. Simone not only fools the public and allows Taransky to resume his career but also becomes a sensation. The fact that she's elusive -- as in never seen in public -- only adds to her allure. This is Niccol's set-up for some sharp comedy and incisive commentary. Simone is generous in its story. It has more plot than the conventional Hollywood picture, which makes it seem longer than it is, but it never seems labored. Niccol knows where to skip over details and jump ahead when he needs to. The movie maintains its capacity to surprise and should also please sticklers for detail. Niccol anticipates the questions -- e.g., how could Simone continue to make movies without her fellow actors knowing she is a digital creation? -- and he answers them. Simone is a fantasy of the malleable actor, not only temperamentally but also artistically. Sitting in front of his computer screen, the director is able to give her line readings and then adjust them to perfection. Simone is also a parody of the kind of bland, soulless beauty that could very well become the obsession of millions. But it's in presenting Simone's effects on the masses that Niccol makes his best observations. In one scene, an investigative reporter goes into a hotel room where Simone has supposedly had a carnal romp. He sniffs at the undergarments that Taransky has strategically left there and lies on the bed, feeling the magic. In another scene, Simone's stand-in tries to seduce Taransky. She's turned on by the idea of being Simone for the night. In both cases, the erotic magic is a function entirely of fantasy. In disarmingly comic terms, Niccol is saying that there's something at work in the whole process of celebrity idolatry that's narcissistic, masturbatory and not a little unhealthy. It's a worship of nothing. The fact that Simone doesn't exist makes the point undeniable, and yet it applies with equal truth to the worship of real-live stars, who are, in their own way, manufactured creations and unworthy of earnest devotion. As the man who made the monster and now has to live with it, Pacino's a blast. He spends a lot of Simone in a room talking to himself, but those scenes are some of the movie's best. Keener is likable in yet another ostensibly unlikable role, as a craven studio head. And as Simone, Roberts gives a witty, satirical performance that's wise enough not to let us know that she knows it's witty. Perhaps Niccol's wisest touch in Simone is that no one ever questions whether Simone is real. Niccol is saying that if she's onscreen, she is real; she's real by definition, more real than anyone else -- and that that's a little sick. ",1
"SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT: Animated comedy. Written and directed by Trey Parker. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie, which opens today, is an animated feature version of the Comedy Central series. Its story actually anticipates a thousand miniature dramas that will be played at theaters wherever South Park is shown. It starts with a group of kids who are horrified to find themselves barred from seeing an R-rated film. Yet, with a little ingenuity and sneaking and lying, they get in. At its most clever, South Park is an argument against the very thing it is: an R-rated comedy with a direct appeal for youngsters. The children in South Park see the movie-within-the-movie and come out transformed into foul-mouthed little monsters. The picture, written and directed by Trey Parker, who created the television series, is a satire on contemporary America. The movie the kids long to see consists of nothing more than flatulence jokes and profane songs. But the songs are incredibly profane, and that's what makes South Park more hilarious spoof than wallow. The world it depicts is only slightly more crude than our own. Parker's comic imagination is unrestrained and irreverent. The film takes several journeys into the depths of hell, for example, where Satan is having a gay relationship with Saddam Hussein (who, in the world of the film, is dead). Other inmates in hell, there without explanation, are George Burns and Mahatma Gandhi. Who knew? There are living targets as well. The film's two biggest laughs are at the expense of the Baldwin brothers and Bill Gates, respectively. The movie, which is full of elaborate musical numbers, expertly done in a grand Broadway style, tells the story of a U.S. war with Canada. The idea is that Canada has been flooding the United States with immoral entertainment, and in retaliation, the United States starts an air war. In a send-up that Noam Chomsky would appreciate, South Park shows the United States going to war in the manner of a totalitarian country -- using the machinery of the entertainment industry to whip up pro-war sentiment. There's a scene that's as brilliant as it is grotesque, in which a starlet performs a vulgar act at a USO show before a cheering crowd of soldiers. She's just the warm-up act for a double execution of Canadian war criminals. As clever as it is, the animation in South Park is terrible. Fans of the show are probably used to it, but for anyone else the temptation to close one's eyes and just listen to the dialogue becomes irresistible at times. South Park is also disappointing near the end when it turns pious and tries to wrap up with a plea against censorship and intolerance. If anything, the movie only amplifies the case that there are certain things kids shouldn't be allowed to see. ",1
"SPY KIDS: Action comedy. Starring Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. . It's not about a dog. It's not about a wizard. It has the pace of an action movie and the immediacy and spectacle of a video game. Yet there's nothing in it that can't be seen by young children. It's entertaining and inoffensive, a rare combination in kids' films, which are usually neither. Spy Kids is such a realized work of the imagination that, watching it, one might figure the movie to be an adaptation of a long-running children's show or comic strip. It has the feel of something that has been around for years, that has acquired layers to it. In fact, the movie sprang from a single imagination -- that of writer-director Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez is not the first name people would typically think of for a children's film. This is, after all, the man who brought us El Mariachi (violent), Desperado (way violent), From Dusk Till Dawn (violent and disgusting) and The Faculty (violent and underrated). Yet at his best Rodriguez has always had a visual gift, a flair for the color and rhythm of sequences, and he puts this talent to its ultimate use in Spy Kids. The audience knows it's in good hands from the first minutes. Carla Gugino plays Ingrid, the mother of Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara), who ask to be put to bed one night with a story. She tells them a tale of two warring spies who fall in love, and as she speaks, we see in flashback that she is, in fact, telling her own story and that of her husband, Gregorio Cortez (Antonio Banderas). The fun starts when Ingrid and Gregorio decide to come out of retirement for a spy mission but are captured immediately. That's when Carmen and Juni find out that Mom and Dad aren't just consultants but spies. In order to save them, the kids have to become spies, too. With that elegantly spare thread of story, Rodriguez constructs a series of amusing scenes and situations. Alan Cumming plays Fegan Floop, a criminal mastermind who has figured out a way to transmogrify secret agents into colorful and distorted Peter Max-like creatures who say everything backward and in a high-pitched voice. Floop lives in a palace filled with virtual rooms, from which he broadcasts his No. 2-rated children's show. Most movies seem as if the filmmakers had just enough ideas to get by. Spy Kids is rich with ideas and gadgetry and filled with a sense of fun. When the kids get to a safe house, they load up on electroshock gum and lasers in the form of crayons. They drive speedboats that turn into submarines. They fly planes and even dart through the sky with jet packs. Carmen carries Juni, then drops him, then has to dive straight down and grab him before he hits the ground. The movie's effects are beautifully realized. An army of thumb people guard Floop's palace. They have thumb heads, thumb bodies and thumb legs. Also guarding Floop are robot kids, who look just like regular children but are machines capable of punching through stone walls. Everything in Spy Kids is brightly colored, even the chains Floop uses to bind Ingrid and Gregorio to their chairs. Cumming is, as one might expect, a delight as the fey and self-satisfied Floop, and Gugino and Banderas look great, which is about the whole game in roles such as these. The kids are the pleasant surprise. Vega manages to play the impatient older sister without acting like a smart aleck, and Sabara brings a sweetness to Juni. He plays it like a timid, spacey kid. Ultimately, Spy Kids is affirming of families and sibling relations. It also affirms Rodriguez's talent. Before Spy Kids it was possible to regard him as flashy but empty, slick but heartless. It's nice to find out otherwise. ",1
"STARSHIP TROOPERS: Science fiction. With Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Neil Patrick Harris. Directed by Paul Verhoeven. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Looks are everything in this exhilarating sci-fi adventure, which opens everywhere today. On one side are the human beings of the distant future. The men are square- jawed and resolute, the women hourglass-figured and resolute, and everyone's teeth are as blindingly white as those of comic strip heroes. Then there are the bugs -- icky insects the size of automobiles, stretching their tentacles across the galaxy. Ambitious and slimy, the bugs are sending out asteroids from their own bug planet, trying to wipe out humanity and extend their empire.  It's interesting that the bugs' existence is never explained or for a moment doubted. They are simply out there as a malevolent force. (If you find a bug hole, nuke it!) The film's special effects are astonishing, but the most notable and unexpected thing about Starship Troopers is its tone. Most sci-fi films give the future a bleached-out look and depict it as cold and mechanistic. Even the movies we remem ber as brisk and peppy (the Star Wars trilogy) often have an austere aura. But Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Total Recall, Showgirls) was wise to remember that hundreds of years from now, there will still be youth, smiles and gung-ho enthusiasm. The film, based on the novel by Robert A. Heinlein, shows an Earth governed by a militarist, technologically advanced federation. Information is dispersed through newsreel-like personal-computer announcements that present even the worst news in a lively, fast-paced style. In the future, a government that wishes to rule must first entertain. These computer newsreels, interspersed throughout the film, provide a sardonic running commentary. More interesting, they say something about the people of this future time. The unabashed jingoism of the announcer, reminiscent of the anti-Communist newsreels of the 1950s, suggests a populace that's happy, gullible and unquestioningly patriotic. Starship Troopers begins like a comic-strip version of a recruiting film. It almost has the form of a World War II propaganda movie that follows raw recruits through basic training into battle -- but with a difference. In '40s war movies, no one ever got his brains sucked out by a big bug. There are no stars. Neil Patrick Harris (TV's Doogie Howser) is probably the only familiar name. The cast of impossibly good-looking unknowns is headed by Casper Van Dien, who plays Johnny Rico, a rich kid from Buenos Aires. (Buenos Aires might just as well be New Jersey. National differences have disappeared.) Johnny's glamorous girlfriend, Carmen (Denise Richards), plans to become a pilot, so Johnny joins the infantry to impress her. Gradually, casually, the customs and beliefs of this future society are revealed, things like racial and gender equality, and male-female showers. Likewise, the emotional side of Johnny's world emerges: the nice, spunky girl who has loved him since high school (Dina Meyer), the stern instructor (Michael Ironside) who becomes a father-figure battle leader. The details are simple but count for something later, when the bugs start indiscriminately slicing off people's appendages. The carnage keeps the R-rated Starship Troopers from being a film for small children or the squeamish. Icky dissections are one thing, and green bug gook splattering the faces of soldiers is all well and good. But mangled corpses, severed body parts, heads with suck holes in them and people being burned alive have a way of disturbing more sensitive viewers. These bugs are bad news -- huge and crablike, with razor-sharp legs. They can leap, they can bite, they can slice, they can dice. They are like food processors, but nasty. Troopers from Earth check into the bug planet, but they don't check out. As Starship Troopers becomes, essentially, a war picture, it loses some of its fascination. But it remains unique. There's an amazing sequence in which a swarm of creepy crawlers and flying insects besieges the troopers' fortress. When the good guys look out over the rim and see a sea of bugs converging, the scene seems as real as the siege of the Alamo, only scarier. The picture seems to depict a future in which weapons technology has not kept pace with other scientific advances. Our heroes can fly to distant ends of the galaxy, but when it comes to fighting the bugs, the soldiers are left with conventional air strikes, tactical nukes and puny machine guns. What about chemical weapons -- you know, Raid, Black Flag? What about flypaper? ",1
"STUART LITTLE: Children's movie. Starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and the voices of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Rob Minkoff. (PG. 78 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Kids, of course, could be expected to react to Stuart as though he were real and become absorbed in his struggles and adventures, but adults may be surprised by his emotional pull. He's like every beloved pet we ever wished we could talk to. Here and there Stuart Little 2 may hit a few wrong notes, but it strikes an emotional chord. The picture takes place in a New York City of such unspeakable sweetness that it can either warm the heart or make a person sick. Mom and Dad (Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie) are the kindly parents of two human children and of Stuart, their adopted mouse son. They live in harmony in a magnificent brownstone (Dad must be doing all right), and Stuart attends school, driving there every day in a red toy convertible. It's a nice enough life for a mouse on the edge of puberty, but he's having trouble fitting in. It's his size. He can't play soccer. No one asks him to play video games. He needs a friend who's about his height -- and then one day he meets one, when a little bird, trying to escape a falcon, lands in the passenger seat of his convertible. Stuart Little 2 benefits from expressive vocal performances for the animated characters. Michael J. Fox gives Stuart a quality of perpetual surprise. As Margalo the bird, Melanie Griffith finds new and expressive ways to use her distinct voice, getting past the baby-talk monotone that has been something of her trademark. In several scenes, Griffith gets to play opposite her Another Day in Paradise co-star, James Woods, the voice of Falcon, a criminal among birds. One does not get the sense of celebrity voices run amok but of actors tailoring their performances to the script, which, by kids'-movie standards, is clever and economical. (It was written by Bruce Joel Rubin, who wrote Ghost.) Comic relief comes in the form of the fluffy, indolent cat, Snowbell -- a live-action character with animated facial expressions, played by a wisecracking Nathan Lane. After about 35 minutes, this short feature starts to drag, as it sets up a story involving Stuart's striking out on his own, but it picks up again 15 minutes before the finish. The movie is buoyed through some of its dull patches by special-effects sequences that are so nicely done that there's no thinking about them as effects. It's just Stuart, flying a model airplane through New York. In fact, the simulation of heights in Stuart Little 2 is expert enough to provoke a weak-in-the-knees feeling. Yet technical smoothness is hardly the film's main virtue. Instead, it's a sweetness that slips in under the radar. The following either constitutes a recommendation or evidence of an impending nervous breakdown, but I found Stuart and Margalo's relationship moving, especially in the way they both grew from knowing each other. However, that information is to go no farther than this room. . This film contains moments of mortal peril. ",1
"SWEET NOVEMBER: Romantic comedy-drama. Starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron. Directed by Pat O'Connor. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Likewise, we can't know if it's a trick of the mind or if Newley really did sing the film's theme song in this way: Sweet November-er-wah-wah-wah . . . Across the decades, it all seems very poignant. The 2001 version is not as poignant, and it has some challenges to overcome in updating a 33-year-old story. It also suffers from the strange casting of Charlize Theron as a ditzy free spirit. Theron is a fine actress, but it seems downright unfriendly to ask a 6-foot-tall woman to play a sprite. As if to atone, the filmmakers do their best to deglamorize the gorgeous Theron, and they succeed all too well. She goes through much of the movie looking like Amelia Earhart after a long day under the hood, and it's only in close-ups that Theron and the screen light up. The film also stars Keanu Reeves as a hard-driving, workaholic San Francisco advertising executive, which also sounds like weird casting, but it works. Sweet November, among other things, is about a guy's journey from unbearable to adorable. For us to buy it, there has to be something redeemable about this fellow going in. With Reeves the sweet-guy aura is intrinsic. They meet cute, too cute, at Motor Vehicles, where Sara (Theron) arrives late for a driving test, carrying groceries and dropping them everywhere. She has a run-in with Nelson (Reeves), who treats her so unpleasantly that she decides she needs to save him. She invites him to move into her Potrero Hill apartment for one month. The premise of Sweet November, intact from the original film, is arresting. Sara's invitation is not romantic, though sex is part of it. Her real interest is in helping him become happy. Her hobby is to find broken fellows and spend one month fixing them. Nelson, she is determined, will be her November project. It takes a while for him to agree, and those scenes -- in which Nelson gradually allows himself to become persuaded -- are the weakest in the film. But once Nelson and Sara are under the same roof, Sweet November takes on a glow that even silliness or cliche can't completely dim. (Here's one cliche: The downstairs neighbors turn out to be cuddly drag queens.) In 1968, just the idea of unmarried people living together raised eyebrows. So the notion of an altruistic woman who lives with a different guy each month -- that had strangeness and mystery, madonna-whore associations that are no longer present a generation later. Yet the most powerful aspects of Sweet November remain -- the sense of something precious, and of time running out. Movies are uniquely capable of conveying the specialness of individuals and the harshness of time. That's what the film medium does best. To film something is to capture its vivid shadow, and to watch a movie is to see the past. No surprise, then, that Sweet November makes a heart-tugging subject. It's about people trying to do that which is attempted with movie cameras too: to stop time and hold something beautiful. November, like life, is fleeting. Nothing can make it stay. Director Pat O'Connor creates a lovely moment in a scene in which Reeves stops and looks around him on a residential block. The setting is pedestrian. Kids playing. People walking in and out of stores. The houses, the skyline. And yet we know exactly what he's experiencing. This is ecstasy, the grown-up version: utter contentment and tenderness, mixed with a sadness that moments can't be held, only felt brushing by. Later, Sara comes home to find that he has covered her walls with November calendars. We get the human condition, rendered in a homey visual. Theron and Reeves, uncomfortable at first, warm up to their roles and do well in the more serious segments late in the film. Sweet November is neither a masterpiece nor a remake of one, but its wistfulness is infectious, and its melancholy mood lingers for days. ",1
"Saraband: Drama. Starring Liv Ullmann, Erland Josephson, Borje Ahlstedtand Julia Dufvenius. Directed by Ingmar Bergman. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Liv Ullmann, as Marianne, decides that she wants to visit Johan (Erland Josephson), her ex-husband, at his summer home, even though she hasn't seen him in more than 30 years. She finds him, at 86, healthy and seemingly enjoying the life of a wealthy patriarch. Of course, he tells her that his entire life has been a complete waste of time, but this is a Bergman movie. He has to say that. And yet Johan is essentially correct. He may be a rational man. He may have some kind impulses, warm feelings and good traits, and he's certainly not evil. But he has left little but pain and misery in his wake, and, even at this late hour -- and in the midst of understanding what his life has been - - he is incapable of breaking the destructive patterns. Marianne, who extends her visit, functions as a witness to the lasting and ongoing damage that one man's arrogance, coldness and spiritual error have wrought on his family. Ullmann's role is almost entirely reactive, but as she proved in Persona (1966), she is one of the screen's great listeners. Johan's son by his first marriage, Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), lives on his property, depending on his father's money and loathing him. As the film begins, Henrik, still grieving over the death of his wife two years earlier, has developed a neurotic attachment to his daughter (Julia Dufvenius), a gifted cellist. But now it's getting to be time for her to leave the nest. Bergman takes about a half hour to establish the situation and put his characters in place and then delivers a series of uncompromising scenes. The encounter between Josephson and Ahlstedt, as father and son, is simply brutal. The scene between Ahlstedt and Ullmann -- seemingly a little get-acquainted conversation -- turns suddenly ugly, in ways that reveal Henrik's deepening neurosis. It's a trait almost as unique in artists as it is in people: If there is no bright side, Bergman will not pretend there is one. He is not seduced by his characters; neither does he root against any of them. Everyone gets his due. Everyone's point of view is accounted for, and so are the consequences of those points of view. His understanding is complete. If Saraband is not one of the best Bergman films, it's a very good one and a valuable statement from a great artist in old age. Grief hangs over the film, echoing the long-lasting grief Bergman experienced over the death of his wife, Ingrid, in 1995. So is the grim conviction that people can't be fixed and few are saved. Yet there's one thing heartening about Saraband, aside from its being a brilliant showcase for the actors. It assures us that Bergman is unchanged. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and full frontal nudity (male). ",1
"Sci-fi Western. Starring Daniel Craig, right, Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde. Directed by Jon Favreau. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The reason for Cowboys & Aliens - the justification for it, the appeal of it, the whole point of it - is contained in the title. Take a cowboy movie, add space aliens. That's a gimmick that could easily have exhausted itself after 20 minutes, but director Favreau, a team of screenwriters and some well-cast actors keep it alive, and the result is a crowd-pleasing summer movie with more wit than most. The more you know Westerns, the more you'll enjoy Cowboys & Aliens. Every Western cliche is pumped up and blown out, not only the cliches of story but of character, costume and set design. Sam Rockwell, as a merchant, shows up with the little round spectacles and plastered-down hair that you've seen in a hundred movies. Paul Dano as a spoiled, sniveling drunken brat on a rampage starts shooting up the town, like every obnoxious skinny kid with a gun from a thousand Westerns. And the shots of the rickety old town, a few structures in a vast nothingness, are a little more forlorn than usual. At the center of it all, of course, is a lonesome stranger with a dark past. This time it's Daniel Craig, as stern and unsmiling as Clint Eastwood, who wakes up in the movie's first scene in the middle of nowhere, with an elaborate metal bracelet on his wrist and suffering from amnesia. But he does remember how to fight. When he takes down four creepy guys - they're filthy with long beards and look like something out of Western central casting - the audience settles in for a good time. For the most part, Cowboys & Aliens delivers. Favreau has a subtly satirical sensibility that can suggest absurdity simply through camera placement, as when Craig stands framed in a doorway, like some Western God, and then says Hello? - sounding just a little unsure and ridiculous. The script is sprinkled with funny moments for viewers in the know. At one point, an exasperated Rockwell turns on someone and says, Why don't you sing a song, cook some beans, do something useful! But the movie's most inexhaustible source of delight is Harrison Ford as a cranky old entrepreneur in an Indiana Jones hat. It's a given in every Ford movie that he's ticked off about something. The trick is to give him a reason to be so surly. Space aliens taking his son? Alien death rays burning up his cattle? OK, these are good reasons. Ford doesn't exactly play for laughs, and in fact the movie provides him with several dramatic moments that he seems to relish. But Ford knows who he is onscreen and what he has come to mean over the decades. He knows exactly where the laughs are, and he nails every one of them. On the downside, Cowboys & Aliens is not the Western answer to Inglourious Basterds. Here genre isn't exaggerated to jar audiences from their complacency or to discover new truths. The movie combines cowboys with science fiction only for the sake of doing it, for the fun of it. Like the novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, you already have the best joke going in. Lacking an overarching purpose or viewpoint, the movie is no better than it happens to be in the moment, and there is a 20-minute stretch, about a quarter of the way in, that drags.  But Cowboys & Aliens gets better as it goes along and benefits from a director with a solid command of tone. The actors may know they're in a comedy, but the characters certainly don't. That's an important difference that allows us, once the premise's novelty has worn off, to care whether Daniel Craig can rescue a very somber Olivia Wilde from the clutches of an alien spaceship, for example. Or to maintain a reasonable interest in the fate of a humanity threatened by gigantic, green, snorting monsters. ",1
"Science fiction may be the defining movie genre of our time, but too often it’s just a vehicle for escapist space adventure or paranoid dystopian fantasy. A sci-fi movie that actually has intelligent things to say about science — that’s all too rare. It’s what we get in “Ex Machina.”Human scale, mind-stretching and eerie, it’s the debut feature from the novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland (“The Beach,” “28 Days Later”). For his first time in the director’s chair, Garland goes easy on himself, creating what is essentially a chamber piece with only four main characters. Yet working within these constraints, Garland shows an uncommon command of tone.In “Ex Machina,” Garland balances absurdist humor with the throb of imminent disaster and just a hint of forlorn romanticism. It’s hard to imagine another director squeezing as many shades and colors from his screenplay as Garland did, and from now on, it would be understandable if he insisted on directing everything he writes.The inevitability of real artificial intelligence is the subject, with Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb, a computer coder who wins a contest to stay for one week at the home of his boss, a tech superstar. When he was  13, Nathan (Oscar Isaac) created Blue Book, which in the world of “Ex Machina” is the biggest search engine in the world, with 94 percent of Internet search traffic. Now he lives in a lavish underground compound, a two-hour helicopter ride from his nearest neighbor, working on experiments that can redirect the course of human life.Isaac has been on a fast track to stardom since Madonna cast him in a major role in “W.E.” three years ago. He has grown with every opportunity, and he gave one of the best performances of 2014 in “A Most Violent Year,” but in “Ex Machina” he has something extra, the glow and confidence of a movie star. To see him here is to have, for the first time, a sense of his doing something that might be called “an Oscar Isaac role,” playing someone charming, relentless and mysterious.After persuading Caleb to sign a nondisclosure agreement that basically allows him to spy on the poor guy for the rest of his life, Nathan reveals his purpose: He has been working on a robot that he believes has true consciousness, not simulated consciousness, and he wants Caleb to meet “Ava,” to ask her questions and to see if he agrees.Ava is a robot with the shape and voice of a woman, and with a human face, hands and feet. The rest of her looks like a machine, and the joining of metal and flesh looks almost grotesque, and yet not quite. For the role of Ava, Garland wisely cast Alicia Vikander, a young Swedish actress with a face of such feeling and delicacy that we are aware of a sensate, human-like force, despite the metal plate she has in place of hair. The title derives from the Latin phrase “deus ex machina” (“god from the machine”) and invites the viewer to contemplate a possible world in which the gods — in this case, human inventors — are no longer necessary, and the machines are on their own. Like “Frankenstein,” it presents the spectacle of human-created intelligence and then asks what that would mean in spiritual terms. Can artificial life have a soul? Or (horror of horrors) would the mere fact of artificial intelligence prove there’s no such thing as the soul?On more practical terms, the movie gives us a blueprint for how an artificial consciousness might be created, using search engine data to discover not just what people are thinking, but how people think. In such moments, “Ex Machina” makes the future feel close at hand, as in too close — as in something we should probably start worrying about, now. ",1
"Scoop: Comedy. Starring Scarlett Johansson and Woody Allen. Directed by Woody Allen. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Not funny heh-heh, but laugh-out-loud funny. Funny like you walk out wanting to tell your friends its best lines. Funny like you're walking down the street and remember a moment and start laughing like an idiot. Woody Allen has written himself an ideal role, creating a character and a situation that result in a continuous stream of winning bits. And he's paired himself with a partner in Scarlett Johansson who brings deftness and freshness to Allen's familiar comic universe. About a month ago, the advance publicity for Scoop was trumpeting the notion that Allen and Johansson have a special rapport. Usually advance publicity is just a fancy term for lies, along with other modern synonyms such as advertising copy and estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. But to see Allen and Johansson together is to believe it. In their scenes, they seem to be playing, and playing off each other, enjoying each other's company. Johansson catches Allen's comic wave without drowning in it. She doesn't imitate him, whine or lose her essential identity, even as she adjusts her usual aura and demeanor to find his tempo. Dianne Wiest can do this. Apparently, so can Johansson. She plays a woman her own age, for a change, Sondra, a college student majoring in journalism and spending the summer with friends in London. One night Sondra goes to see the Great Splendini, a magician played by Allen. Splendini is easily the world's worst magician, with tricks that are clearly bogus, and to see the fatuous expression on Allen's face as he goes through his act is almost in itself reason to see Scoop. Splendini calls up Sondra as a volunteer from the audience and places her in a wooden box for some routine trick. In there, something truly supernatural happens, something not part of the act. The spirit of a dead ace journalist (Ian McShane) appears, and in the few seconds available to him, he gives Sondra the ultimate scoop: He has reason to believe that the handsome and fabulously wealthy Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), the son of a lord, is a serial killer. In the hope of making her name as a journalist, Sondra enlists the magician, whose real name is Sidney, to help her catch the serial killer. From this setup, which Allen puts into place within 15 minutes, all good things flow. Sondra and Sidney find a way to enter Peter's circle, and they pass themselves off as a father-daughter pair of blue-blooded Americans. It's wonderful and absurd. As played by Allen, Sidney is a sleazy Catskills entertainer who dresses in loud sports jackets. He doesn't look wealthy. He looks as if he's barely scraping by, but Allen gives him a completely baseless confidence in his ability to improvise casual conversation with British lords and ladies. Apropos of nothing, he brings up foxhunts. Passing as a WASP, he complains about Jews. The character's combination of absolute confidence and absolute ineptitude is hysterically funny. The movie's weaknesses don't make much of a difference in terms of audience enjoyment, but they do keep Scoop out of the pantheon of Allen's greatest achievements (Hannah and Her Sisters, Annie Hall, etc.). Sometimes scenes end clumsily, and the mystery plot doesn't make complete sense, in retrospect. Allen takes elements of a murder mystery and bends them to his comic purposes, but he doesn't deliver a thoroughly satisfying mystery story. Allen does, however, deliver the funniest movie of the year so far. -- Advisory: This film contains sophisticated conversation, sexual situations and threats of violence. ",1
"Seabiscuit: Drama. Starring Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper. Directed by Gary Ross. (PG-13. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The film is ambitious. It's the story of a horse's career, but it's also the story of the three men behind the horse, as it were -- an owner, a trainer and a jockey, whose troubled lives were redeemed by their work with Seabiscuit. What's more, the movie aspires to tell a larger, American story about a nation in the late 1930s, just beginning to regain hope at the end of a long Depression. Seabiscuit shows how a small, underestimated and ungainly horse became a symbol for Americans who saw themselves as underdogs and who wanted to believe in second chances. The film is audaciously languorous in the early going. Just as the book takes about 50 pages to build, Ross takes a good 40 minutes to lay the groundwork for what are, essentially, three separate stories. We meet Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), a San Francisco entrepreneur who makes a mint in the car business; Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a cowboy and horse trainer whose way of life vanishes as the old West gives way to the new; and Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), a jockey and sometime prizefighter who has to fend for himself after his family hits bottom during the Great Depression. Ross has so much to juggle, he sometimes gets lost. The movie starts in 1910; then 21 years pass, and it's 1929. Interesting. Then six more years pass, and we're told it's 1933. In addition to the personal sagas, Ross wants the audience to know about happenings in the country at large, and for that he employs David McCullough, author and narrator of the PBS documentary series The American Experience. As black and white photos appear and archival films flicker, McCullough's voice-over fills us in about Henry Ford, the assembly line, the stock market crash, the New Deal, etc. If the word iconic would be used about a voice, McCullough's qualifies -- it's familiar to millions for his narration of Ken Burns' The Civil War, alone. Using McCullough to narrate makes Seabiscuit feel like a combination narrative film/American Experience documentary. That's a hybrid that might have been interesting had Ross chosen to take it all the way. As it stands, the use of these documentary passages seems unintegrated and clumsy -- not obnoxious, certainly, but inartistic. It's a half hour before any one of the three principals meets another, and by the time they do, each has been through the mill, including the wealthy Howard, whose marriage has collapsed and whose son is dead. Now newly remarried (the movie could have skipped the first wife altogether), he decides to get into racing. His own sorrow draws him to the mystical goodness of Smith, and it's Smith who finds the ideal jockey, Pollard, and the ideal horse. For those who read the book, the horse, as depicted here, will inevitably be disappointing. Short, thick, dark and irrepressible, Seabiscuit was both a champion and a character. Alas, horse actors are rare, and so the movie Seabiscuit (played by 10 different horses) is of necessity less vivid. But the races are fully realized. Much of the film's second act consists of the buildup to Seabiscuit's fabled 1938 match race with War Admiral, an encounter that the movie squeezes for every ounce of drama. Seabiscuit may sneak up slowly, but it inspires powerful emotions. Maguire, Bridges and especially Cooper, whose performance is just lovely, convey the poignancy of men striving for a moment of definition and glory in a lifetime of struggle. That it all depends on something as ephemeral as an animal's life and as delicate as a horse's legs makes it all the more touching. I found myself choking up at unexpected moments. I won't be the last one. The movie's sole black spot is in Ross' creation of a fictional character, a fast-talking, buffoonish radio announcer, played by Wlliam H. Macy. It's a classic device of sports movies to use an announcer's explanations to push a story along, but it's too cheap for this movie, and the character is a blight on the film's tone. If Ross was so desperate to keep the audience informed, he could have let McCullough do more voice-over, rather than put words into the mouth of an idiot. This strikes me as a resounding hideousness, a mind- boggling blunder. But put that aside. Maybe in the afterlife movies will be perfect. Even as it stands, Seabiscuit is the one of the best films of the season. ",1
"Secret Window: Drama. Starring Johnny Depp, John Turturro and Maria Bello. Directed by David Koepp. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.): Drama. Starring Johnny Depp, John Turturro and Maria Bello. Directed by David Koepp. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Adapted and directed by David Koepp, Secret Window belongs to the elite category of King adaptations, such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Shining, with its first-rate cast and production elements. It's not sensational but subtle, and it builds from the unease of its first moments to an almost suffocating mood of helplessness and vulnerability. Even if a certain glibness in the plotting deflates its impact somewhat at the finish, it remains an eerie, playful thriller and an all-around entertaining time at the movies. Not least among its pleasures is that of seeing Johnny Depp in the relatively straight role (for him) of Mort, a successful writer of thrillers and mysteries whose life has become derailed as a result of a nasty divorce. One day Mort writes half a paragraph, and the next day he cuts it; and in between he sleeps on the sofa in his bathrobe, a productive individual turned into a heap of rags by writer's block and love gone bad. Loud knocking announces the arrival of John Shooter (John Turturro), a tall man in black who wears a variety of hat that no one this side of Amish country has worn since 1870. He identifies himself as a Mississippi dairy farmer, and it's probably the movie's intention that he doesn't resemble a real dairy farmer so much as a New Yorker's exaggerated concept of what a Mississippi dairy farmer might look like. Shooter is angry because he believes that Mort stole from him an unpublished story. We know he's not merely miffed but boiling mad from the way he screws up his eyes and twists his mouth as he talks: No one can do the screwy-eyed, twisty-mouth rage thing quite like Turturro (although John Leguizamo might give him a run for his money). So we know within minutes that Mort has a psychotic on his hands. Two questions remain, How crazy is he? and What might appease him? -- questions that the rest of the movie will answer, though the first can be easily guessed. The farmer is really, really crazy. The movie then becomes a race for Mort to prove that he indeed wrote the story honestly before his stalker can do permanent damage to him, his ex-wife (Maria Bello) and his property. As an actor, Depp has always been attracted to eccentric roles, and the part of Mort, who can barely rouse himself to wash or dress, certainly qualifies. But this time, Depp inhabits the character's eccentricities instead of merely commenting on them. The result is that in a role that calls for long stretches in which he must hold the screen alone -- and other long stretches in which he is expected to make the audience fear for his safety -- Depp is not just quirky and clever but also likable and engaging. The camera work is that of a classic thriller, with the protagonist often filmed in full shot, from behind or from the side, to create the sense that he's being watched. The smooth menace of the film technique is accentuated by Philip Glass' score, in which minimalism is mixed with nouveau Hitchcockian flourishes and orchestrations. It's one of the year's best film scores. Though the plot could be accused of getting a little too cute near the finish, Secret Window is far from a lazy thriller. In fact, unlike most thrillers, this one actually gets better upon reflection. Little turns and remarks that may have seemed discordant in the moment suddenly make sense on second thought. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, strong language, violence and the depiction of animal cruelty.

"Seven Pounds: Drama. Starring Will Smith and Rosario Dawson. Directed by Gabriele Muccino. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Will Smith is interested in emotional pain now, in the dark side of American life, in people who are sad or sick or just plain unlucky, and he's found a partner in the Italian director Gabriele Muccino. The team collaborated on Pursuit of Happyness, a 2006 film that told the true gutter-to-riches story of a brilliant, talented man who still almost fell through society's cracks. Their new film, Seven Pounds, is a spiritual successor to Pursuit, but darker and more oblique.  In fact, the movie is so roundabout and cryptic that it takes half the running time just to figure out the general nature of what's going on. Seven Pounds makes a mystery of its lead character and of what he's pursuing, and for a very simple reason: If the movie were to announce its subject and story in the usual straightforward way, it would seem so ridiculous, far-fetched and borderline distasteful that no one would want to watch it. It might even seem funny.  So Muccino's task is clear, if difficult - to generate enough magic and to work up just the right mood so as to cast a spell on viewers. That way, when the movie's intentions and meaning are finally made clear, nothing will seem discordant or strange. All will make sense. For the most part, Muccino accomplishes this precise balance that Grant Neoporte's screenplay requires. Going in, all we know about Ben (Smith) is that something terrible has happened in his past, and that he feels responsible for it. That's all. Everything else we gradually piece together, through a fractured narrative that jumbles the time sequence. We learn that he is an IRS agent. Later, we see that he does field audits, but audits of a very particular and repugnant kind. He seems to specialize in hounding people for back taxes when they're in the hospital, sometimes with serious illnesses. There's anger in this guy. In one scene, he talks on the phone to a food company's customer service representative (Woody Harrelson), and when he finds out the man is blind, he goes ballistic and starts taunting him, making withering, demeaning remarks and shouting into the phone. Obviously, this is not the usual Will Smith, and that difference is half the appeal of Seven Pounds, to see a familiar screen presence show new sides of himself. Smith has made a point of stretching in recent years. Even in the title role of Hancock, which was in most ways a routine action movie, Smith had to build a character different from his usual rambunctious action persona, tapping into reserves of sorrow and disillusionment. But he goes much further in Seven Pounds. His breeziness becomes a shallow act, and his smile becomes downright eerie, a strained mask that hides pain, wards off hostility and expresses aggression all at the same time. It's a smile with dead eyes.  Throughout, Seven Pounds has a distinct quality. The pensive score, the subjective cinematography and even the muted aspect of the featured performances all contribute to a sense of being trapped inside a waking dream, or nightmare. Ben leads a hollow existence, a death in life, and the people with whom he comes into contact are the forgotten, who have dropped out of the world.  Enjoyment of Seven Pounds rests entirely in how one reacts to the romance that develops between the austere IRS agent and Emily (Rosario Dawson), a graphic artist suffering from congenital heart failure. Some will cry foul, say it's too much, that the movie turns maudlin. But for those who find themselves on the film's wavelength, this is love at the edge of the universe. This is the kind of thing that inspires people to write operas.  Dawson, with her strident but delicate beauty, is worthy of operatic treatment. Seven shows once again that she has it in her to be a powerhouse, even as it showcases a sweetness and vulnerability she hasn't shown before. Dawson, who played Mimi in Rent and Edward Norton's girlfriend in Spike Lee's 25th Hour, is ready to take her place as a major screen actress. In the end, the most appealing thing about Seven Pounds is the element it shares with Smith's more cheerful movies: It affirms life as something enormous and important, not small, not meaningless, but monumental and worthy of big statements.  -- Advisory: This film contains disturbing images.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Shark Tale: Animation comedy. Starring voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Jack Black and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Rob Letterman. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Areatheaters.) Like the first Shrek, Shark Tale is animation for cynics. It's a movie bereft of the main filmmaking virtues (such as passion, the need to tell a story, the need to say something), but with enough secondary virtues to pick up the slack: Cleverness, a strong cast and a director with an eye on the clock. A lot of the jokes are in-jokes, but they're funny, and there's a decent story as well, about a small fish who wants to become a big fish and tells a whopper of a lie. There are two main characters in Shark Tale, and the key to the movie's success is that it concentrates on the right one. There's Lenny, a gentle vegetarian shark, voiced by Jack Black, and there's Oscar, a little fish who wants to be a big shot (the voice of Will Smith). A focus on Lenny might have tilted the tone in a poignant direction. Instead the picture hones in on Oscar, a hustler who'll do anything to get ahead and who hates his job, as a tongue scrubber in a whale-washing shop. Oscar feels like a nobody. He keeps saying that he's a nobody, and the story endorses that point of view. (It's a heck of a message for a movie to be pumping into the minds of children, that a hard-working guy is a bum. But it's par for the course in an era in which fame is prized above all things.) In love with Oscar is an angel fish, voiced by Renee Zellweger, but Oscar is too busy running from loan sharks to notice her. Lenny's story brings in the Mafia element. He's son of the local mob boss, Don Lino (Robert De Niro), who is disconcerted that Lenny refuses to be a killer and won't eat anybody. This is in contrast to Lenny's brother, Frankie, a carnivore from way back. Frankie is played by Michael Imperioli, best known as Christopher on The Sopranos. Vincent Pastore, another Sopranos veteran, plays Don Lino's dim-witted adviser, , an octopus named Luca. If all this sounds asinine, well, I wouldn't attempt to defend the concept. What can't come across in a story description is the shimmering lavender and violet color palette and the freedom of the animation. There's depth of field. There's panning within the frame. Individual characters have distinct facial expressions, and so one feels as though one's watching not pictures but performances. When Don Lino scowls, his lips compress in a way that looks like De Niro, at least, if De Niro were a shark. This is funny. I'm not saying it's a scream, but it's enough to get you to the next moment. A blowfish, voiced by Martin Scorsese, who is known for his nervous staccato speaking style, has thick eyebrows like Scorsese and some of his mannerisms. And Oscar looks a little like Smith, too. These are visual in-jokes, and the script is loaded with spoken in-jokes, as well, some of them fairly obscure. For example, when Oscar, who has falsely advertised himself as a shark slayer, finds himself about to fight a shark, the crowd goes into an African chant last heard at the Ali-Foreman bout 30 years ago. Kids won't catch that reference, but then kids won't catch the Mafia movie references, either, or realize that the line You had me at 'hello, '  was originally said in another film. What kids will grasp is the underdog's story, and they'll enjoy the exuberance and the spectacle. If kids somehow miss the point of Shark Tale, that lying to get ahead has a way of working out in the end, all the better. In any case, it's hard to complain about an animated film's cynical worldview, when it's precisely that cynicism that makes it capable of surprising -- and amusing -- adults. ",1
"Shrek the Third: Animated comedy. With the voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy. Directed by Chris Miller and Raman Hui. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Though the series dipped into corniness with Shrek 2, Shrek the Third has none of that. It's irreverent and fast paced and is designed to please impatient parents just as much as children. There are some pop culture references to the 1970s, with Heart's Barracuda and Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song featured on the soundtrack, but there's never the sense of a movie begging for laughs by throwing in anachronisms. The jokes are organic to the movie, to its sly and slightly caustic worldview, and they don't stop coming, from start to finish. There's a great bit in which one of the villains questions Pinocchio about the whereabouts of Shrek (Mike Myers), knowing that Pinocchio can't lie. Well, I don't know where he's not, Pinocchio begins and launches into a series of carefully worded answers worthy of a politician on a Sunday morning talk show: I'm possibly more or less not definitely rejecting the idea ... The original notion that inspired the series, of a magical and yet workaday land where fairy tale characters go about their lives, still provides a source for cheeky humor. This time out, the arrogant and overweening Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), reduced to working as a sideshow performer, decides to corral the energy of all the disgruntled villains whose happily-ever-after never happened. These characters, like Rumplestiltskin, Captain Hook and the Evil Queen, live a marginal existence, spending their lives drinking in a loser bar, and they jump at the chance to help Charming take over the kingdom. Charming sees his opening, because King Harold (John Cleese), the frog, is dead. His deathbed scene, in the movie's first minutes, sets the tone. There's no sentiment about it. It's grotesque, protracted and ridiculous -- and very funny. He leaves Shrek the kingdom, if he wants it. The only other possible heir is a young fellow named Arthur (Justin Timberlake), who lives far away. As Shrek has no interest in being king, he sets out with his two companions, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), to find him. Uh-oh. A journey. We know what that usually means in animated movies: The whole story is going to be about the journey, with a series of incidents thrown in to stretch the thing to feature length. But no. That doesn't happen here. Eight screenwriters contributed to the screenplay of Shrek the Third, and they wrote it as if they had a boot on their neck. Things happen fast. Bits that another film might have milked for an hour, Shrek the Third condenses to 10 or 15 minutes. And just when you think you know all their moves, the filmmakers come at you from another angle. The revisionist takes on legendary and fairy-tale characters are a consistent source of amusement: Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph) has hair extensions. Snow White (Amy Poehler) is vain and resourceful, and Guinevere (Latifa Ouaou), of future Camelot fame, is an insufferably self- absorbed high school girl. It also helps that the prattle of Murphy as Donkey is kept to a minimum. The film has two directors, Chris Miller and Raman Hui, neither of whom has ever made a feature film, though both have extensive experience working on the visual side of animation. It's probably no accident that, for all its other virtues, Shrek the Third is an unusually pretty movie to look at, beautiful in both execution and design. In fact, though it's subtle, Shrek the Third gives a beauty makeover to Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), slimming her down and softening her facial features. Either that or she's glowing from being pregnant. ",1

Mobsters have a price on his head because he's ratting them out to the government. Other mob factions want to kill him because ... well, just because. I don't have it all worked out yet. But there are lots of characters: three punks with Mohawks and bad teeth, wielding flamethrowers and chainsaws. A female assassin (Alicia Keys) and her partner. A bail bondsmen (Ben Affleck) and his buddies. A Swedish assassin (Vladimir Kulich) known as the Swede, of all things. And an austere-looking, bald assassin (Tommy Flanagan). They all want to kill Buddy, and I think they might all want to kill one another in order to be the one to kill Buddy, but I'm not sure why. Oh, yes, and there's another assassin, too, a smooth-talking guy with a mustache. He's working for somebody, too. So three-quarters of the cast are contract killers. The rest are feds, headed by Andy Garcia, a fiery actor who has found an odd cinematic niche playing cold, emotionless and untrustworthy men of power and influence. He's the boss, and he wants to prevent Buddy from being killed. He puts his best man (Ray Liotta) on the case. Does this sound like a mess? Well, it is a mess. Yet either by design, instinct or luck, Carnahan comes up with a way to make this overly complicated movie very simple. He does it with an appropriately simple device. He has Buddy rent a suite in a Las Vegas hotel and stay there the entire picture. That means that, even though there are too many characters to follow and too many motives to keep track of, we always know where everybody's headed, and we always basically know what's going on. They're heading to Vegas, to the top floor of that hotel. If they're wearing a tie, they want to save Buddy. And if they're wearing anything else, including a Mohawk or hot pants, they want to kill him. With that settled, the audience is able to enjoy all the other things that Carnahan can do -- his inquisitive camera work, his witty dialogue and his skill at drawing idiosyncratic characters with a minimum of flourishes. Piven fares especially well as the sweaty mobster wannabe, the essence of the obnoxious Vegas entertainer: narcissistic, fast-talking and not nearly as clever, powerful or tough as he pretends. Keys also gets a good showcase: She's not only beautiful, but she also has an exceptional speaking voice, low and gritty and full of sly fatalism. Carnahan creates a spectacle of nihilism, with a number of scenes of carnage, including a shootout in an elevator. This vision is no mere gesture, as it is for, say, Guy Ritchie. Here and there one gets the impression that what we see onscreen is the product of some turbulence within the filmmaker. That makes it interesting. Still, I doubt this is the extent of what Carnahan can do as an artist -- I think he has more to offer. In the meantime, Smokin' Aces has humor and flash, and there's always something going on. -- Advisory: Strong violence, gore, dismemberment, harsh language and nudity. ",1
"Snakes on a Plane: Comic thriller. Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Julianna Margulies and Nathan Phillips. Directed by David R. Ellis. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A distinction must be made: There can be no doubt that people were going to enjoy this movie no matter what. After months of hype on the Internet, people were going to like this movie even if they had to force themselves. Nobody sleeps outside a theater to have a bad time. But take all that off the table -- forget the promotion, forget the phenomenon -- and just sit there and watch it. This is a perfectly respectable picture that, despite its modest aspirations, accomplishes something elusive: It finds and maintains that delicate balance between the genuinely thrilling and the flat-out ridiculous. The picture opened Friday (actually at 10 p.m. Thursday) without screening for critics, usually a fatal sign, but in this case there was no reason to hide it. Perhaps the reasoning went that, for Snakes on a Plane, reviews wouldn't matter. That's probably true. Or perhaps someone thought the movie would be best served if it were seen the way it's going to be seen by most people, late at night with a raucous crowd. That's certainly how I saw it. At San Francisco's Metreon on Thursday night, there was a packed house, and yet two prime seats on the aisle were unoccupied. Closer inspection revealed that someone had thrown up on those seats, which should give you an idea of the condition of some people entering the theater. The mostly young audience came determined to root, shout and heckle Snakes on a Plane into a fun experience, and yet within 20 minutes it became clear that that would take no strenuous effort. Contrary to expectations, the picture did not turn out to be so bad it's good, but rather so extreme it's good, so shrewd it's good, so funny it's good, so good it's good. If Snakes on a Plane is ultimately remembered for anything, it may be as the apotheosis of Samuel L. Jackson, as the movie that most tested Jackson's ability to maintain his cool under circumstances of extreme exasperation. He plays an FBI agent, transporting a witness from Honolulu to Los Angeles. If the significance of that plane route isn't immediately clear, take a look at the map: Between those two points, there's nowhere to land a plane. The witness (Nathan Phillips) saw an evil crime boss (Bryon Lawson) commit murder, and the boss does not want him to reach the mainland. So with lightning speed he improvises a way to bring down the plane. He arranges to have hundreds of poisonous snakes put in boxes for transport and to have the snakes aroused into a frenzy by the spraying of pheromones throughout the plane. That's all he needs to for a crisis -- and all the screenwriters need for a premise. It's no surprise that Snakes on a Plane should be a blast at the beginning. When two randy young lovers go into a cramped airplane bathroom together and start taking off their clothes, the only question is where the snake will bite them -- but that's a question of intense interest. In another bathroom interlude, a man absentmindedly urinates, not noticing that he is directing the flow onto the head of a disgruntled snake that has crawled up through the plumbing. When the snake latches on to him ... no, this is just too ghastly to talk about. That's all very funny, screamingly funny, hysterically funny, but that all comes in the first half-hour. The wonder is that screenwriters John Heffernan and Sebastian Gutierrez and director David R. Ellis are able to stretch this into a satisfying feature-length movie. They succeed by avoiding a couple of easy outs and by doing a lot of things right. The main shortcut avoided is to get cute and try to make a bad movie, as though that would be fun. Yet another avoided is the temptation is to dive head first into the ridiculous. Though Snakes on a Plane is to a faint degree a satire of action movies, and though it's made with a sophisticated awareness of the conventions of those films, it nonetheless actually works as a straight-up action movie. It consistently offers up interesting and perilous situations, and it places characters that we come to care about in those situations. This is not Airplane. There's no winking at the audience. The director's wisest move is that, though some of the passenger characters are intended to be funny, he has the principals -- Jackson and Julianna Margulies, as a flight attendant -- play it straight. In fact, Margulies' performance could be transposed into a dramatic film with no adjustment. This is a good thing that keeps Snakes working as a thriller. Is there something more here? Is there anything more to be said? Is this a metaphor for terrorism? The movie began life as a screenplay a decade ago, but it took until now for the true marketability of snakes on a plane to be realized. There's probably something going on here, but it might spoil the fun to figure it out. -- Advisory: Violence, blood, death, harsh language and snakes attaching themselves to sensitive parts of the body.

"So the first “Thor” was rather small-scale and charming. It didn’t take itself seriously. Then the second “Thor” came along with a bad case of blockbuster-itis, which obliterated most (but not all) of the appeal of the first movie. And now we get “Thor: Ragnarok,” which, aside from having one of the world’s worst titles, combines aspects of both its predecessors and in the best possible way.It’s a big movie. That was foreordained — there’s no going back from big. The rule with action series is that they must get bigger and bigger until they actually explode. But this time it’s not too big. “Thor: Ragnarok” has a lot of human appeal and a spirit of silliness that it never loses and yet always carefully manages, so that the silliness remains an ongoing source of delight without ever undercutting the impact of the action.The movie begins with an absurd situation, in which Thor is the chained captive of a creature that seems to be made of fire. The fire man is enormous and has a body that’s like a thin layer over an inferno, a look that is intentionally borderline ridiculous. (Much of this movie resides in that discrete zone of intentional borderline ridiculousness.) After making some wisecracks, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finds a free hand to reach for his hammer, and what follows is an action sequence that’s rousing, tongue-in-cheek and resolved in a slapstick sight gag.So the tone is set within five minutes: This is going to be fun. “Thor: Ragnarok” lives up to that promise, despite a more than two-hour running time. It sustains its energy, keeps its sense of humor and succeeds in coming up with yet another variation on the old evil-about-to-destroy-the-entire-universe plot. Strange how in recent years these stories have become such a mainstay. People must be very worried about the universe. This time the existential threat comes from within Thor’s own family. King Odin — that is, Anthony Hopkins, who has apparently reached the stage in his career where it’s mandatory that he die in every single movie — feels his strength waning and informs his two sons, the earnest Thor and the scheming but sometimes OK Loki (Tom Hiddleston), that he can no longer hold their sister in captivity. The two didn’t know they had a sister, but oh, boy, do they ever have a sister, an older one, and she is not in a good mood.Cate Blanchett plays the returning sibling, Hela, and you can almost feel Blanchett’s pleasure in this role flowing out in waves from the screen. She looks great, dressed in skintight black and a black wig, exuding power and attitude and announcing herself as the “goddess of death.” It’s fun to watch her, and it’s surely fun for Blanchett, too — like getting to act and taking a vacation from acting at the same time. Hela wants to claim the throne of her father and use that as a launching pad, basically, so as to bring death and chaos to the rest of the galaxy. And no one can stop her.Now if this were a linear, typical action movie, the rest of “Thor: Ragnarok” would consist of a series of boring skirmishes between Thor and Hela, each noisy but inconclusive, until finally the movie reached feature length, just in time for the climax. But this movie doesn’t do that. It has confidence in its characters and in its own invention, and so it avoids repetition and stays fresh. Jeff Goldblum shows up in a thoroughly amusing feature role as the preoccupied, half-mad ruler of a planet devoted to nothing but entertainment. Benedict Cumberbatch pays an enjoyable visit as Dr. Strange, and Mark Ruffalo has some funny moments as Bruce Banner, the scientist who must not get excited lest he turn into the Hulk. All of them benefit from playing off of Hemsworth. For all his gifts as an action star, Hemsworth is a nimble comic actor — a straight man to other people’s antics in one scene, and then a skillful buffoon opposite Tessa Thompson, as the hard-drinking Valkyrie. He knows exactly what he’s doing and is easily half of this series’ appeal. ",1
"So the future may be shaping up to be just as horrible as the pessimists have been predicting, but with a few unexpected twists. Yes, people will become enslaved, but not to governments, but to social media and search-engine companies. And yes, people will be watched and monitored, but not against their will, but with their permission. They’ll just give it all away, freely.“The Circle,” based on Dave Eggers’ novel, is as chilling as the most frightening horror movie. Yet the world it depicts is practically our world, just a tiny leap into the near future. Here’s a proposal: Let’s put together a time capsule and make guesses as to how people 50 years from now will see this movie. My guess is they’ll consider it a quaint throwback to when people were still fighting it, before they realized that love is hate, and two plus two equals five, and that the computer in the sky loves us all very much.Directed by James Ponsoldt and adapted by Ponsoldt and Eggers, the movie tells the story of a young woman who goes to work at the Circle, a company that’s like a hellish cross between Facebook, Apple and Google. Young Mae (Emma Watson) is thrilled to be welcomed onto the Circle’s campus. Everyone is so cool. Everyone is so friendly, and everything is so weird. The place is run by its two founders, who, in an inspired bit of casting, are played by the inherently likable Tom Hanks and Patton Oswalt. What harm could those guys do?In an early scene, the more extroverted of the two, Eamon (Hanks), does a presentation in an auditorium full of employees. He is wearing egalitarian jeans and a T-shirt, and he introduces the company’s new product, as the employees cheer as though at a Pyongyang pep rally. The company will soon be marketing a new camera. It costs next to nothing, and you can wear it. It will record every moment of your life, follow every step and log facial recognition data for everyone you see. Sounds great, right?The story of “The Circle” is basically about all the events that spring from Mae’s agreeing to becoming the first person ever to go “transparent.” Aside from a few timed bathroom breaks, her life is out there, being broadcast and commented upon, all day and every day. And the world is following her.What makes “The Circle” so valuable is not only that it’s showing us a ghastly possible path that the world may take, but also that it articulates the mentality that could create and sustain it. According to Eamon, complete transparency strengthens democracy — nothing untoward can happen behind closed doors. It enforces morality — people tend to be at their worst when they’re sure no one can see them. And anyway, privacy is a form of theft, isn’t it? After all, if you have a great experience offline, you’re essentially robbing others of the possibility of vicarious participation.This is demented thinking, but it has a certain logic to it, and a shred of truth. Privacy may not be immoral, but it is most definitely subversive, and thus it would have to be classed as immoral by the people in power. It’s in privacy that people decide how they really feel and what they really want. The privacy of the masses is the greatest threat to totalitarian control.Outside the enclosure of privacy waits the online goon squad, always ready to reinforce the stupid consensus through an idiotic stream of commentary. The online comments shown here are dead-on and maddening. They are offensive even when they’re friendly, in that they contain the built-in presumption that people have the right to comment on the private lives of strangers.“The Circle” is very much a plea for the preservation and sanctification of privacy, but it’s nicely constructed in that no one character expresses the film’s distinct point of view. Mae remains more technology-friendly than the filmmakers. Meanwhile, her boyfriend (Ellar Coltrane from “Boyhood”) is an antitechnology absolutist, not at home in the modern world. And Mae’s parents (Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton) seem amiable and lost, trying to mind their own business and create their own safe space. Alas, older people are so naive.

"So what can we say about a movie such as “Finding Oscar,” a documentary that deserves to be seen, that deals with an important subject, that is intelligently and conscientiously made, and yet will give no pleasure to those who watch it? This film is, to say the least, disturbing, and that’s even if you close your eyes for some of it.It tells the story of a 1982 massacre in Guatemala. In a small village called Dos Erres, government troops came in and killed everybody — men, women, little children, babies. It was a civil war, and the military rulers were wiping out supposedly leftist opposition, though it’s hard to see how babies can be communists. It turns out this was one of 600 or so massacres that took place during a conflict that lasted decades.It’s heartrending and can make you despair for humanity. It’s a cliche to say it, only because the world provides too many opportunities, but what is wrong with people? At one point in the film, the surviving relatives go in and start excavating the well where the bodies were dumped. They come back with bags and bags of bones. For the cameras, a bag of male bones is dumped onto the ground, then female bones, and then child bones. How does one process a horror such as this?One man, a survivor — he happened to be away from the village when the soldiers came — had his entire family wiped out, his wife and six kids. He has a huge, rough nose, the mottled nose of an alcoholic. He says, “I tried to drown my troubles in alcohol. But my troubles learned to swim.”That man turns out to have a living son, which is the second part of the “Finding Oscar” story. Apparently, a 3-year-old boy survived. He was adopted by one of the soldiers who helped to kill his family, but he had no recollection of his origins. He was contacted almost 30 years later and told his true identity.Now this is the part that’s really interesting: He was contacted not only as a personal gesture. The authorities investigating the massacre needed his DNA. If his DNA matched the bones of any of the victims, it would, in effect, identify the dead family and make it easier to prosecute the murders.So this is a worthy film, with lots of human moments, such as when the father and son reunite after many years apart. But it’s also a film with horrific shots of open graves. By all means see it if you have the inclination, but do be aware of the experience you’re letting yourself in for. ",1
"Some people won’t want to laugh at “Ted 2,” and they might succeed if they fold their arms across their chest, close their eyes and gag themselves. But they might laugh even then. Writer-director Seth MacFarlane is like some weird combination of a stupid, dirty-minded teenager and a brilliant comic master. His impulses are sophomoric, but he knows where to find the punch line, and he hits it, again and again.He has more going for him than audacity, but he has plenty of that, too. Are you ready for a Robin Williams joke? Are you ready for a 9/11 joke? How about a joke that combines Robin Williams and 9/11? “Ted 2” contains laughs about things that seem as if they just happened — for example, a scene with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady that references the  deflated football scandal. Watching “Ted 2” is like being in the mental space of a comedy piranha, ready to devour any red meat the second it appears.Very quickly, it becomes fun just trying to figure out where MacFarlane will go. At one point Ted — the teddy bear come to life, voiced by MacFarlane — and his best friend, John (Mark Wahlberg), are in a room with sperm samples. There really is no reason for them to be there, so clearly, something funny has to happen. It does, and on a grander, cruder scale than you might guess.Oh, yes, and on three occasions the movie suggests that Amanda Seyfried, who co-stars, bears a resemblance to Gollum from “Lord of the Rings.” Seyfried is a very good sport, because if MacFarlane hadn’t mentioned it, nobody would have noticed. But the resemblance is enough that the audience catches the reference immediately. Throughout, there are celebrity cameos, all of which find their mark. Liam Neeson plays a version of the cautious, paranoid character he’s been playing in action movies, and Jay Leno appears in a single shot that’s a big laugh.The movie begins with the marriage of Ted and his girlfriend, Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), and with its vivid language and drug allusions, the movie earns its R rating within about three minutes. The sheer  vulgar-mindedness of “Ted 2” is off-putting, but only briefly, until the movie wins over the audience with its fertility and inventiveness. There are just too many jokes not to laugh, and they come from every direction.One of the first scenes, for example, is a marital spat between Ted and Tami-Lynn that’s like a parody of real-life versions, inflected by the absurdity of one of the participants being a teddy bear. This is probably a good place to mention that, for all the vulgarity of MacFarlane’s impulses, he does not sexualize Ted, lest the bear become a version of Chucky from the horror movies. Ted has no genitals and doesn’t seem to miss them, but it does mean that he and his wife may have to adopt.The story of “Ted 2” deals with Ted’s legal troubles — that is, his societal status as a bear that has come to life. Does he have full civil rights? The story is enough to hang the jokes on, but not so much as to slow things down, though if you’re counting, there are probably more laughs in the first half.Jokes aside, there is something not only funny but winning in the way that Wahlberg plays his scenes with Ted. He buys into the fantasy completely and, like the most simple, openhearted soul imaginable, talks to it/him like this is the most cherished friend in the world.That openheartedness helps “Ted 2” succeed — and for almost two hours of running time. MacFarlane is cynical, but he’s not a cynic, and there are moments in “Ted 2” where you can sense a longing for the gentler and more upbeat entertainment of an earlier generation. Just look at the opening credits, which take place over a production number straight out of “The Great Ziegfeld” (1936).MacFarlane is doing it as a spoof, but it’s too well done to be only a spoof. There’s some love there, too.",1
"Sometimes a good story is enough, and “Concussion” is one of those cases. In many ways, it’s cliched in the telling, old-fashioned without being classic, with a sappy soundtrack and lead performances that are so intended to inspire that they almost backfire. But writer-director Peter Landesman has a fascinating and appalling story to tell here, and that cuts through the layers of corniness. “Concussion” is the story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian pathologist working in Pittsburgh, who discovered a disease caused by football, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. A natural consequence of the game, it comes from multiple blows to the head, and it results in motor-neuron symptoms, aggression, suicidal tendencies and early dementia. How early? We’re not talking about 70s or even 60s, which would be horrible enough. We’re talking about men in their 40s losing their minds. For those of us who weren’t quite paying attention when this made the news a few years back, and especially for parents whose teenage sons want to play football in high school (and even middle school), “Concussion” is a genuine public service. It’s also a medical mystery tale and a saga about a decent, honest scientist going up against a big-money monolith.  Omalu is played by Will Smith, and it’s difficult to know what to make of his performance here. Or rather it’s easy to know what to make of it, but the impressions are conflicting. Smith tends to bring an insufferable radiance to his heroic roles, and so he plays Omalu as something like a holy fool, only brilliant. There is no shadow of darkness in his performance, not even a hint that this man might someday, possibly, wake up in a sour mood. There is no one in the world as good, as cheerful and as pure as Will Smith when instructed to play a hero. And yet ... if Smith is selling snake oil, it’s pleasing snake oil. When he talks to each corpse before he does an autopsy (“Help me find out what happened to you; I need your help”), or when he faces down an NFL official with righteous rage (“Tell the truth!”), Smith does convey an unclouded spirit. It’s as if we don’t believe his acting even as we’re affected by it, so that we never forget we’re watching Will Smith at the same time as we’re really hoping things work out for Dr. Omalu.  A point in favor of “Concussion” is that it sticks close to the truth, unlike some recent fact-based films (“Suffragette,” “Trumbo,” “Steve Jobs”). The NFL players who suffer and end up on Omalu’s autopsy table are real people, such as the former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster (David Morse), who went through a hell of torment before his death, at age 50, in 2002. Omalu, against the resistance of colleagues, but with the backing of an enlightened boss, kept studying Webster’s case, until he made his discoveries. As the nice boss, Albert Brooks is almost as saintly as Smith, though at least with Brooks we can watch in hope that another shoe might drop. Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays Prema, a nurse from Kenya, who provides Omalu with emotional support when he needs it. I suppose playing opposite Will Smith in a Christmas Day release would be considered a step up for Mbatha-Raw. But after seeing her on fire in two films last year, “Beyond the Lights” and “Belle,” it’s a comedown to watch her spirit domesticated into the routine girlfriend archetype. If “Concussion” is your introduction to this actress, you still haven’t seen her.  That Omalu is an immigrant gives “Concussion” an interesting extra angle. Coming from the outside, he just assumes that the NFL will welcome his findings and make proper adjustments (perhaps such as shutting down altogether). He has no idea what he’s dealing with, but we do, and the film’s presentation of the NFL, not as the guardians of America’s game, but as something almost akin to the tobacco industry, is unexpected and refreshing.

"Sometimes fathers and sons are alike, but just as often, fathers produce an opposite reaction in physics in their male offspring. So after 20 or 25 years, you end up with two guys staring at each other from different worlds, each wanting something from the other and each wondering, “Who is that guy?” and “How did this happen?”“Viva” will inevitably be sold on the basis of its two most obvious and least important features: (1) It’s a portrait of Havana, not the colorful side where everybody is singing and the 1950s cars look glamorous, but the Havana that real people — that is, poor people — live in. And (2) it explores, to some extent, the world of drag performers who work in a nightclub, wear flamboyant get-ups and lip-sync to torch songs. Still, the essential element, where this movie really lives, is in its timeless, universal portrait of a father and grown son getting to know each other.Jesus (Hector Medina) is a hairdresser who works on the wigs used at the drag club. He gets the idea he wants to perform — he’s not very good — and on his second appearance onstage, a burly middle-aged guy steps out from the crowd and punches him in the face. Guess who it is? Why, it’s Dad, of course, a former boxer, newly released from prison.Dad is played by Jorge Perugorria, a remarkable Cuban actor who does not for one second sentimentalize this father character, who is mostly a brute. Without asking for either sympathy or understanding from the audience, he somehow gets both. Perhaps simply by staying truthful moment to moment, Perugorria suggests something deeply lost and disappointed about this man, that he has wasted his life in every possible way, and that he knows it. He’s like a beast that has been fighting the impulse to become a human being his entire life, and now he’s losing energy for the struggle.Jesus hasn’t seen his father in years and doesn’t recognize him, but that doesn’t stop Dad from moving into Jesus’ desperately miserable apartment. Jesus is delicate, slight and gay; and Dad, who is big, lumbering and straight, decides that he’s the boss. Suddenly, Jesus has this menacing guy, this virtual stranger, invading his space and telling him what to do.“Viva” — the title comes from Jesus’ drag incarnation — is an unusual cultural hybrid. It’s set in Cuba, filmed in Cuba and stars Cuban actors, but it has an Irish screenwriter (Paddy Breathnach) and an Irish director (Mark O’Halloran). And though it would be lying to say that the Irish influence is obvious, it does make sense once you find out about it. In the best way, “Viva” has the feeling of an Irish family drama, about a hard, hard-to-reach and hard-drinking father and a sensitive son. If this were a hundred years ago and set in Dublin, Jesus would be a young poet, not a drag performer, but the effect would be the same.The lively setting helps, but the main attraction here is the familiar story, which has been around forever and yet never gets old.

"Sometimes it’s obvious who is on the right side of history. Sometimes the universe even gets involved and gives a big, fat hint. In the 1950s, the state of Virginia prosecuted a couple for the crime of marrying outside their race. The couple was named Loving, of all things — Richard and Mildred Loving — and the new film about them bears their name. The Lovings were simple people who never expected to do anything flashy enough to be dramatized on a movie screen. But their case eventually made it all the way to the Supreme Court and to an important 1967 decision that prohibited states from denying the right of interracial couples to marry. “Loving” tells the story of their marriage and of their legal battle, which played out over nine long and trying years.  In recounting the history, writer-director Jeff Nichols takes an approach that makes “Loving” a little more interesting than you might expect, but also slightly less satisfying. He doesn’t roll out the usual Hollywood effects, with the soundtrack blaring the horns of hope and the assurance of ultimate justice. Rather he presents a low-key story about stress and doubt and unfair punishment. When justice finally comes, it’s not about glory or making history. It’s about finally being left alone, which is all this couple ever wanted in the first place. It might help that Richard and Mildred Loving are no longer with us, because it frees Nichols to present them as plain folk, not as sages in disguise or diamonds in the rough. At the start of the film, Mildred (Ruth Negga) is a very young black woman, who knows nothing outside her family and her small rural community, and Richard (Joel Edgerton) is monosyllabic, white and wary. They are naive people one might worry about even without the entire social structure of the South and the state of Virginia up against them. Living in a part of the state where race relations are more relaxed than in other places, the two fall in love and drive to Washington, D.C., to get married. Five weeks later, back home in Virginia, the door to their bedroom is kicked open in the middle of the night, and the police shine their flashlights at them. They’re arrested for breaking the marriage law and face the real prospect of prison time. The atmosphere of “Loving,” the feeling it evokes, is the film’s most distinct quality. The mood is somber and restrained, and the characters — not just the principals, but the people they know — seem beaten down. Houses are surrounded only by land, with no other houses in sight, creating a sense not of unlimited expanse but of desolation. It’s hard to imagine anyone escaping from this place, just as it’s almost impossible for the characters to imagine ever leaving it. Nichols makes us feel that we’re seeing the Lovings’ world, and that their world is defined by limitation. This only emphasizes the sense of injustice the movie creates. These are not people equipped to fight any organized authority. They have no power, no education, no money and no connections. They don’t even have a sense of their own uniqueness or importance. Their decision to marry seems less like a courageous stand than as the spontaneous act of people too unworldly to care about the opinions of others. That these people should be the victim of a police-state type arrest — the 3-in-the-morning shattering of the peace — is outrageous. As we watch, we wonder what miracle will intervene that might let them survive. As played by  Edgerton, Richard is dependable and decent, but shy and backward, and he remains so throughout the story. It’s Mildred who grows over the course of years, coming into an understanding of how outside forces — lawyers, publicity, Life magazine — might advance the Lovings’ case.  Negga, who is of Irish and Ethiopian descent, finds warmth and a sense of purpose in Mildred, two qualities that are radiantly apparent in the real-life Mildred, as seen in news footage from the time.  For the most part, though, these are unlikely heroes, hardly heroes at all, but rather good and nice people whose fortunes become hostage to the times in which they live — the still-racist 1950s South and later, the emerging modern era of the 1960s. Such characters are not the usual stuff of drama, and we end up partly missing the familiar dramatic elements, of people working consciously and diligently toward a specific, worthy goal.  “Loving” offers something more loose, more leisurely, and it doesn’t grab you by the shirt and insist that you watch it. It’s quieter and more like life, not exactly triumphant and definitely not sad, just complicated.  Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic.

The film is based on recently unearthed transcripts of Scholl's interrogation and trial, as well as interviews with people who knew her or knew of her in her last days. In this way, it bears a family resemblance to Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, also about a religious young woman being put through the bureaucratic machinery of murder. Stylistically, the movie bears no relationship to the Dreyer film, except for one running visual reference -- a shot of the untroubled sky, from the condemned woman's perspective. Director Marc Rothemund chooses instead to be self-effacing, and he makes a virtue of that choice. Rather than adopt a Dreyer-like strategy of dramatic close-ups and dreamlike compositions, Rothemund gently inflects the story, providing humanizing touches and delicate nudges in moments of peak drama. Mainly he gets out of the way and lets two things tell the story -- the narrative record, which is clinical; and actress Julia Jentsch's face, which is a study in contained passion. Like Joan of Arc, Scholl combines a visionary worldview with a young person's naivete. She and other members of her dissident group, the White Rose, operate under the romantic delusion that, through leaflets, they can inspire a student uprising that will topple the government. They think ideas and information alone can dislodge fascists, when it usually takes the addition of things like tanks and bombs. At the same time, she has a shrewd awareness of the world situation, and her conception of the future -- which includes Germany's defeat and war-crime tribunals for Nazi leaders -- couldn't be more prescient. At the center of the film is Scholl's interrogation by Robert Mohr, a Nazi functionary who is no intellectual match for the young woman. He is a man from a humble background, whose loyalty to the regime stems from the opportunities it has afforded him. In his aspirations for himself and his country, he is an unambitious man, and he can't help but see Sophie as a privileged troublemaker. But he also sees her as a kid, and without saying so actor Alexander Held conveys that he feels sorry for her. He is not evil but rather a man on a small scale flummoxed to encounter a grand spirit. Held's is the second extraordinary performance in Sophie Scholl. In the end, the film leaves audiences with a lingering question, Was Sophie Scholl's sacrifice in vain or not? At several points, she is given a chance to take a lesser sentence, and she chooses not to. Did Scholl's act form some kind of breach in the monolith of authority, or was it just the waste of young and promising life? That will be the opening gambit of every dinner conversation destined to follow screenings of Sophie Scholl. -- Advisory: This is hardly a children's movie, but there's nothing that can't be seen by children.

"Sound of Thunder: Science fiction. Starring Edward Burns, Catherine McCormack andBen Kingsley. Directed by Peter Hyams. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If movies have personalities, this one has an appealing one, combining scientific inquisitiveness with giddy pleasure in creating tension for viewers. That quality -- a kind of mentally vibrant impishness -- can be traced at least in part to author Ray Bradbury, though his 1952 short story has been altered considerably in the film's retelling. The script has time to be witty and doesn't seem rushed, though director Peter Hyams never stops hurtling the movie forward, in ways that are usually fantastic, believable and genuinely exciting. No, Sound of Thunder doesn't transcend its genre. It doesn't morph into something profound. But within the limits of his ambition, it gets almost everything right. The one exception, minor in the grand scheme and yet impossible to ignore, is that the special effects look jarringly artificial. The designers have come up with a compelling look for this future world -- Chicago, 2055 -- with buildings that look ultra-modern and very much in the Chicago style. But the technicians were apparently unable to put people onto those streets without it looking like images superimposed onto a computer screen. At one point, Edward Burns, who plays a scientist, seems to be walking in place, while the backgrounds move behind him. Indeed, it all looks so fake that one could assume it was an intentional statement, but it can't be. So it's not a movie about effects but about a couple of ideas and a bunch of thrills. Science has invented a means of going back in time, and a sleazy businessman (Ben Kingsley) has already come up with a way to exploit it. Dr. Ryer (Burns), who works for him, gets paid to lead hunting tours for rich people who want to go back in time 65 million years to hunt dinosaurs. The procedure is always the same: Ryer, his colleagues and his clients, in their time-travel jumpsuits, open up a little tunnel into the past and stand there. A Tyrannosaurus stumbles up, and the travel party blasts it with nitrogen bullets. Afterward, the clients look ecstatic, while Dr. Ryer looks vaguely disgusted with himself. The movie's message is not anti-hunting per se. We find out later that the Tyrannosaurus was about five minutes away from getting buried in molten lava from a nearby volcano. And apparently, every time Dr. Ryer and his colleagues go back in time, they kill the same dinosaur. The scientist's unease rather has to do with two things: His knowledge that he's engaged in something frivolous and distasteful, and his intuition that (to paraphrase Nancy Sinatra) he's messing where he shouldn't be messing. The great innovation of the The Sound of Thunder, one that originates with Bradbury, is that when something has changed in the past, the present isn't automatically transformed. Rather the changes come in waves of escalating intensity, time waves, which start small (changes to the climate) and build up from plant life all the way up to complicated organisms. What's brilliant about this is that the horrors roll out slowly, with increasing drama, and the film becomes a race against the clock. Catherine McCormack, who burst into prominence as Mel Gibson's angelic (and soon-to-be-dead) wife in Braveheart, finds a nice change of pace playing a crusty, angry English scientist, who knew all along that something like this would happen. Normally, this would be a role for Tilda Swinton, but McCormack plays it well, businesslike, caustic and intellectual, without a hint of sweetness. And as always, Burns makes for an affable and convincing leading man. Once the premise is in place, The Sound of Thunder becomes a series of adventures and ever-multiplying horrors, as the world becomes more physically hostile, and wild, creepy-looking creatures appear everywhere. But the human element isn't lost. If it were, that would have been ironic, considering the subject. ",1
"Standard Operating Procedure: Documentary. Directed by Errol Morris. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) The notorious Abu Ghraib photographs were the jumping-off point for Errol Morris' new documentary, Standard Operating Procedure. Through interviews with prison guards, some of whom have done time for prisoner abuse, Morris tells the story behind the photos and, in the process, tries to re-create the culture of Abu Ghraib. He gets past the media shorthand and illuminates the circumstances and personalities responsible for those images that shocked the world. Along the way, Morris widens our understanding of the real crimes that took place there. This is where the movie becomes not just a slant on history but also a vehicle for broadening our understanding. Morris makes a strong case that the worst atrocities took place off-camera and that the soldiers who were convicted - no one above the rank of sergeant - were punished mainly for embarrassing the Bush administration.  Here's the perfect example. You've probably seen photos of Specialist Sabrina Harman, smiling and giving the thumbs-up sign in front of an Iraqi corpse. Heartless and appalling, yes. But how about the real question - how did that guy get dead? He was apparently killed in the course of an interrogation, but no one was ever convicted of that crime, which is the real crime. The worst things happened off-camera. Nothing is as simple as it looks. Harman is a particularly interesting case. She was taking pictures from the beginning and writing letters to her girlfriend, saying that she was doing this to prove to the world that the U.S. is not what they think. She claims in another letter to be putting on a fake smile in these ghastly situations, in order to maintain the trust of her fellow soldiers. At the same time, in her on-camera interviews, she admits to taking part in the sadism. It's as if her capacity for remorse could only kick in upon reflection, hours later.  Morris films the interviews with the technique he has used in previous documentaries. He has the camera set up so that the interviewees can see him through the lens, thus encouraging interviewees to look straight into the camera as they talk. The results of this process have a confrontational immediacy, like a talking version of a Richard Avedon photo. The interviews are illustrated through disturbing and graphic photos, of detainees being forced to masturbate, forced to wear panties on their head, forced to assemble themselves into pyramids of flesh or handcuffed into excruciating stress positions. An ominous Danny Elfman score accents these grotesque scenes. Janis Karpinski, the brigadier general in command of the military police at Abu Ghraib, didn't seem particularly savvy when the scandal erupted in 2004, and perhaps for that reason made a convenient fall guy. But in her interviews here, she is forthright, direct and boiling mad. She comes off quite well, as does Javal Davis, who was convicted of participating in the November 2003 humiliation and abuse of prisoners. He has the best insights into the psychological culture of Abu Ghraib and says in the interview that the person he is now, being interviewed, is not the person he was that night. Lynndie England, the pint-size private who was featured in some of the most scandalous images, makes for a surprisingly sympathetic figure, a young woman who was goaded by her older lover, Cpl. Charles Graner, into posing for photos and participating in these events. At times, the movie conveys a sense of Abu Ghraib as a place where the U.S. government sent its stupidest soldiers to do a stressful, difficult job: to oversee hundreds of prisoners while undergoing repeated shelling from insurgent forces. But the full story is more complicated. Indeed, it's more complicated than the documentary can quite specify, and that's its one weakness: The audience comes away from the film understanding what happened with regard to the photos and believing that the guiltiest parties remain unpunished. But beyond that, with regard to the big picture, the documentary is weak on specifics.  Standard Operating Procedure reveals one mystery, only to reveal another that it can't quite penetrate.  -- Advisory: Very graphic images of blood, torture and nudity.",1
"Stardust: Fantasy. Starring Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sienna Miller and Robert De Niro. Director Matthew Vaughan. (PG-13. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and show times, and to buy tickets to select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies .)If Pirates of the Caribbean showed what you get when you make a movie fantasy out of an amusement park ride, Stardust shows what you can get when you base one on a novel. Stardust is in many ways what Pirates was intended to be - an adventure story set in the past, with elements of romance alternating with elements of the grotesque and supernatural. It tells a story on a wide canvas, with lots of idiosyncratic characters, disparate pockets of adventure and splashy effects. But unlike Pirates, Stardust is anything but a wretched mess. It's a charming and smartly plotted fantasy that follows several characters, each in hot pursuit of something essential to their survival. The stakes are high for everyone, and ultimately all the strands come together with a sense of inevitability. The storytelling is the movie's prime virtue, and everything else is extra - but those extras are generous. Stardust is a film of humor and imagination, with an exceptional cast. Based on the Neil Gaiman novel, the story takes place in a world in which there are, in fact, two distinct worlds, separated by a wall. On one side is a picturesque but prosaic English town from about 200 years ago. On the other side is an enchanted forest, a world of magic that no mortal has ever seen - until a young man leaps the wall and has a night of bliss with an enslaved princess. Nine months later, back in his lackluster town, a baby arrives on his doorstep, a son named Tristran, who becomes the focus of the story. Tristran (Charlie Cox) grows up to become a romantic and something of a bumbler, with big dreams and deep emotions. He's in love with a shallow local girl, Victoria (Sienna Miller), and one night, as they sit together, they see a falling star streak across the sky. In true storybook fashion, Tristran tells Victoria that he will return in one week and bring back the star for her, which becomes a kind of a romantic test. If he can do that, the idea goes, he will prove himself worthy and win her hand - or at least prevent her from agreeing to marry someone else.Stardust sets up a story in which everyone has a selfish motive for finding and possessing the star. Tristran is motivated by love. Michelle Pfeiffer is a 400-year-old witch who needs the star to regain her youth. And an evil prince, Septimus (Mark Strong), needs a medallion worn by the star, without which he can't take possession of his father's throne. The star itself is not a thing but a person. Her name is Yvaine (Claire Danes), and she wants to get back to her place in the firmament. Because the characters are all driven by a specific need, they drive the story. Michelle Pfeiffer, who had lots of fun hamming it up in Hairspray, has even more of a blast in Stardust, as the leader of a coven of three wicked sisters. A temporary spell enables her to regain her youthful looks, but in order to make her youth a more permanent feature, she needs to kill the star and cut out its heart, which she's looking forward to. As a young woman, Pfeiffer always had a down-to-earth, put-upon grumpiness, but that quality was never really exploited. Now in her late 40s, she may be coming into her queen years in a particularly entertaining way. She seems to genuinely relish being imperious and appalling. Director Matthew Vaughan casts some famous faces in cameo and feature roles, but instead of having them merely show up, he places them well and gives them things to do. Ricky Gervais has a couple of funny scenes as a merchant. Peter O'Toole is sly and absurd as a morally depraved old king. And Robert De Niro clowns it up as a closeted gay pirate ship captain, one of the world's most macho professions. Though the special effects are at times a little more elaborate than necessary, they don't overwhelm the story's human scale. Danes, with those brown eyes that never lie to the camera, conveys the purity of essence one expects from a star - at least the ones in the sky. And Cox, in his first important role, gives us the scope of Tristran's journey, from haplessness to heroism. This is a young leading man with a future.-- Advisory: Some grotesque images and violent scenes.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts. ",1
"Starring Benjamin Walker, Rufus Sewell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Dominic Cooper. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The title, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, guarantees about 15 good minutes. Just on the strength and novelty of the gimmick - combining the real details of Lincoln's life with a secret antivampire history - the movie was bound to command a certain absurd appeal. The trick was in getting audiences past those 15 minutes, and that's what the movie does.  Based on the novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a money-making stunt that its author - who also wrote the screenplay - wisely decided to treat with seriousness, or at least an attitude of seriousness. Instead of getting smirky and campy and blowing out the joke in the first few scenes, Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov straight-face it. They ask themselves, well, what would it be like if the main struggle of Lincoln's life were with vampires intent on taking over the new world? And they answer the question as realistically and soberly as they can within this loony framework.Further, they invest emotionally in the conceit of the story and in Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) as a man. Imagine: He didn't just save the union and free the slaves. Here was a man dedicated to the proposition that all vampires must be destroyed. That makes for an even greater Lincoln, one yet more worthy of reverential treatment. Along the way, Grahame-Smith comes up with a metaphor that is appropriately descriptive of slavery and flattering to the Union. In this telling, the Old Confederacy was a hotbed of vampirism. Perhaps this should not come as a big surprise, given that the slaveholders were sucking the life out of their slaves. The movie, which makes Lincoln into an impassioned abolitionist from childhood (that's not quite accurate to history) links, from the beginning, Lincoln's hatred of slavery to his hatred of vampirism.  And oh, does he hate vampires. Remember how Lincoln's mother died in 1818 of a thing called milk sickness? Well, it's not the milk that gets her in this one. Enough said.  The movie traces the rail-splitter's career from his early days, studying law and splitting vampires heads open, to his career as a politician and later as president: Just take the standard Lincoln story, and add hand-to-hand vampire combat. To love and not merely appreciate Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter would require relishing the vampire battles. Here, they get old quickly, but then they generally end quickly, too. The exceptions are two extended action sequences - one on a train, another taking place amid a stampede of horses - that are clever and imaginative but so CGI happy that they're like looking at a computer screen. It won't be long before audiences recoil from that computer-canned look the way we'd reject rear projection. Computer-generated imagery can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but they can't fool all of the people all of the time.  Near the finish, when the Lincoln/vampire gimmick is about to run out of gas, brevity saves it. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter doesn't end at the ideal place, with the audience wanting more, but at least it ends before the audience is ready to give up hope.  As Lincoln, noted stage actor Benjamin Walker is a tall, lean guy with a big hat who can swing an ax. What else can be said? If he ever plays Hamlet, there will be a lot more to say about him. In a role created just for the movie, Rufus Sewell does the usual British villain thing (polite, scary) as an ancient vampire, Lincoln's nemesis. Particularly welcome is the altogether fitting treatment of Mary Todd Lincoln, in Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance, as an attractive, vivacious young woman who becomes first lady in troubled times. It's well known that Mary Todd Lincoln got a little nutty in her later years. Now we know why.‌‌",1
"Starring Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Directed by Andres Muschietti. (PG-13. 100 minutes.) Jessica Chastain has become a good excuse to see any movie, and this is for two reasons. The first is that it's a pleasure to watch her development. She has been consistently capable, usually brilliant and often quite different from role to role, and she's different in Mama, too, playing a black-haired rock chick who discovers her maternal side under highly unusual circumstances. The second reason comes under the category of quality control. Either through luck or intuition or exquisite taste, she only seems to appear in high-quality movies. Apparently, this even holds for Mama, a horror picture released in January, and it's really worth taking a moment to appreciate that: A horror picture released in January. That is usually the equivalent of saying, It's going to be awful, and it's going to be awful. But in fact, Mama is skillfully made, and although Chastain is the best thing in it, she's not the only thing in it. She plays the bass player in a rock band, and she has the bass player personality in this one: not a hotshot, not trying to be cool, just cool without trying. She lives with her boyfriend and has black fingernails, and in her first moments onscreen she is celebrating that a pregnancy test has come back negative. Yet kids will soon enter her life, two girls, and oh, do they have troubles. The girls, little children, are discovered in the woods, having survived for five years under rugged conditions. Their parents are dead, and so their uncle (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his girlfriend, Annabel (Chastain). assume custody. What the young couple doesn't know is that the girls had a guardian in those woods, a supernatural mama, who is evil, needy, irrational and, most importantly, jealous. Mama doesn't want to lose those kids, and she doesn't want any new mama getting in the way. Here and there, Mama contains flashes of action, and throughout it's apparent that some climactic confrontation is inevitable, and yet the movie is mostly about the characters. Mama gets its effects, not by threatening to show you something hideous, but by getting under your skin and into your head. Moreover, like the best horror films, it has a reverberation beyond the circumstances of the movie.  Though by no means a sophisticated examination of motherhood, it's nonetheless some kind of hysterical expression of thoughts surrounding the subject and afloat in the public mind. In Mama, Chastain is not the archetypal average person you usually find in horror films. She is someone quite specific and therefore more recognizably real-world to us - thus more anomalous and interesting in a horror context. She is a no-nonsense modern woman with a career on her mind who doesn't want kids and has no real reason to like these kids in particular. Yet we see her opening up to the experience, not in some corny, sentimental way, but in the forthright way such a woman would.  That's probably what attracted a major actress to this role; and it's what Mama offers us that lesser horror movies don't.  Director Andres Muschietti is cinematically literate - in one example he borrows a flashbulb effect from Hitchcock's Rear Window - and he has visual panache. Much of the movie is surprisingly beautiful. Muschietti also casts the movie well, down to the faces of the featured players, who are just a little more vivid than usual. And he somehow knows how to get successful performances from children. But, speaking of children, one caution. How was this movie rated PG-13? Ten minutes into the film a father puts a gun to the head of his little daughter. Think that might be a disturbing sight for children? Come on, folks. Get serious.",1
"Starsky & Hutch: Action comedy. Starring Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller. Directed by Todd Phillips. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Phillips' style, which he honed with Road Trip and Old School, is outrageous and coarse, featuring grand-scale bits that at the same time never become loony enough to distort the characters or situation. Starsky & Hutch is character comedy writ large, with much of the humor coming from the contrast between the two heroes, whose personality conflict has been accentuated in the translation from TV to big screen. Starsky (Ben Stiller) is a by-the-books cop with a hair- trigger temper, a fanatic who'd shoot up an entire city street and destroy thousands of dollars in property to retrieve 7 bucks from a purse snatcher. Hutch (Owen Wilson), meanwhile, has a looser style and looser ethics. He's not above relieving corpses of their excess cash, fraternizing with shady, underworld types and doing recreational drugs. Like the show, which premiered in 1975, the film takes place in the 1970s -- but a vague mid-'70s that's identified as 1975 but is filled with anachronisms. For example, the leisure suits and line dances seen in the discos look more like 1976, and the Walkman and the top-loading VCR shown are of a kind that didn't exist until 1979. One glorious 1970s throwback, the flashy pimp, appears in the person of Hutch's friend Huggy Bear, played with unflappable cool by Snoop Dogg. Leave it to the cultural anthropologists to figure out why, for a brief period in the mid-'70s, the notion of the dapper pimp captured the imagination of every writer in television. Both on the outs with their department, Starsky and Hutch are thrown together as partners and clash immediately. When a dead body washes up on the beach, Starsky becomes jazzed about investigating a homicide, while Hutch doesn't want to be bothered: I say we push it out and hope it floats to the next precinct. The homicide is related to a multimillion-dollar cocaine deal being instigated by Feldman (Vince Vaughn), a flamboyant businessman. He has teamed up with a scientist to offer a new variety of cocaine that smells and tastes like artificial sweetener but packs the wallop of the real McCoy. This is coke, he says holding up two plastic bags. And this is new coke. The screenplay, by Phillips, John O'Brien, Scot Armstrong (Phillips' regular writing partner) and Stevie Long, keeps things percolating with inventive moments of absurdity and character comedy, then lowers the boom on audiences with situations that are side-splitting. The temptation is to describe these moments, but to do so would diminish the experience. Suffice it to say that the comedy is in good hands with Stiller and Wilson, whose skills, in terms of precision, economy and apparent effortlessness, are pretty near impeccable. Faces turn up from earlier Phillips films. Vaughn, Snoop Dogg, Juliette Lewis (as Feldman's girlfriend) and Will Ferrell (who plays a bizarre convict obsessed with dragons) all appeared in Old School, and Amy Smart, who plays a professional cheerleader, was in Road Trip. This tells you that people like working with Phillips and that he's building an informal ensemble. I'd like to see Stiller and Wilson become part of that ensemble. Starsky & Hutch won't change anybody's life, but -- like the first Austin Powers movie -- it can liven up an evening and make audiences already start thinking kindly about a sequel. Advisory: This film contains nudity (from behind), sex jokes and drug references. ",1
"Stephen Sondheim’s “Into the Woods” makes a smooth translation to the big screen in a new adaptation, written by James Lapine, who wrote the musical’s book, and directed by Rob Marshall. Faithful but not slavishly faithful to the source, the movie retains most of the songs but streamlines the story, particularly in the second half.The biggest change is one of tone, which is partly just the result of the switch from stage to screen. Movies literalize everything, so some of the whimsicality of the stage version — the comedy, the satirical edge, the absurdity, even the sense of “Here we are in front of you, telling you a fairy tale” — is lost, and the story becomes more serious. But the darker tone is also clearly the director’s intent, and you can tell from the performances. It’s one thing if the witch, as played by Meryl Streep, suddenly becomes a dramatic character, but when Tracey Ullman, a comic actress, chooses to play Jack’s Mother as though she were starring in “The Grapes of Wrath,” you know someone told her to do that. Yet, for the most part, Marshall’s approach succeeds. It might even have been the only approach that could have succeeded.A fairy tale mashup from before mashups were invented, “Into the Woods” combines four well-known stories, changing them slightly to make them all fit together. There’s Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), who doesn’t quite have a fairy godmother but still gets her ball gown. There’s Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), and an impoverished boy named Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), whose name will soon be linked with a beanstalk. And finally there’s Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), who really needs to do something with her hair.Linking them all is the story of a baker and his wife, played by James Corden and Emily Blunt, who are seeking to lift a curse that is preventing them from having children. They are the heart of the movie, the thing that keeps the experience from being merely clever.Those who love Sondheim’s music should love the treatment here. Those who don’t love the music are advised to maintain a polite silence, because Sondheim lovers have long since made non-lovers feel like complete ignoramuses for saying indelicate things like, “But every song sounds the same.” Actually, I’m told that if you listen to the soundtrack two or three (hundred) times, and concentrate really hard, the songs do start differentiating themselves. In any case, there are always the lyrics, which are the real point anyway. As conveyances for Sondheim’s brilliant, funny and unexpected turns of phrase, the songs do quite nicely. So do the singers. Streep, whose ability to do everything no longer even raises an eyebrow, has a strong, pinging voice as the witch. More surprising is Blunt’s ability to carry off the show’s most tender and emotional moments, not just dramatically, but musically.With archness and irony, “Into the Woods” goes deeper into the fairy stories, allowing us to see familiar archetypes in new and not so flattering ways. Chris Pine, who doesn’t just play Captain Kirk in the new “Star Trek” franchise but could be on his way to becoming the next William Shatner, savors playing Prince Charming’s fatuity and self-satisfaction. But the overall effect of the movie’s approach to these fairy tales, though amusing, has an underlying sadness built into the design. Life, Sondheim and Lapine seem to be saying, is less enchanted than children are led to believe.By the movie’s last third, the point has been made and the central gimmick has begun to fray, but by then “Into the Woods” has stored up enough goodwill to take it safely home.",1

Comedy. Starring Steve Carell, Olivia Wilde, Jim Carrey and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Don Scardino. (PG-13. 100 minutes.) Steve Carell became famous when he took a supporting role in a Jim Carrey movie (Bruce Almighty) and stole the show. So it seems only right that 10 years later Carrey should put himself back on the map by stealing Steve Carell's latest picture, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. The movie is pleasant. It's reasonably funny. But the one who gets the real laughs here, the hard laughs, is Carrey, who plays the kind of role he should be playing - a complete lunatic. Forget lovable. Carrey doesn't need to be loved. With his particular gift, he should just play an array of lunatics and let lovable take care of itself.  The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is about a lonely kid who uses magic to overcome his alienation and grows up to become a Vegas attraction. Burt (Carell) headlines the act, with his best friend, Anton (Steve Buscemi), but while Anton remains the same sweet guy he always was, Burt, with the years, has become insulated and arrogant, and the act has grown stale.Carrey, as a long-haired street magician turned TV star, represents the next wave in magic, and his mere existence makes Burt and Anton look passe. Instead of doing sleight-of-hand tricks and splashy disappearing acts, he takes magic into the realm of the disgusting. He hides a playing card under the skin of his face and has to slice himself open to retrieve it. In another scene, he goes for the record in keeping his eyes open, and to make things interesting, he has his assistants shoot streams of pepper spray into his eyes. What helps make all this really funny is that the character's masochistic commitment to magic is nearly matched by Carrey's masochistic commitment to comedy. That might not be pepper spray being sprayed into Carrey's eyes in a steady stream, but even water couldn't have been too comfortable. He's bug-eyed and raving and hasn't looked so at home in years. It's as if Carrey has been waiting, through a series of bland and corny showcases, to find a role that doesn't derail or divert his intensity, but embraces it. Just like the magician, Carrey's talent is not about quirky. It's about anarchy, about making an audience squirm.  At the start of Burt Wonderstone, Burt has contempt for his work, treats his partner like a lackey and is lewd to every woman he comes across, including his new assistant, Jane (Olivia Wilde). He has no conception that his stardom might be failing, even when the owner of the hotel chain (James Gandolfini) lays it out for him. So the movie becomes the story of Burt's re-education as a human being, with plenty of comic opportunities along the way. As someone who has lived most of his life in hotels, he doesn't know that people don't do the dishes by just putting them outside the door. Wilde and a comically amiable Buscemi serve as sturdy straight men for Carell, who then pays the favor forward in his scenes with Alan Arkin, as the great magician who inspired him. Comedy or drama, Arkin has an appealing way of being so cynical he's idealistic - that is, cynical about his own cynicism and exhausted by his own exhaustion. Something about Arkin must be right for our era, because he seems to fit right in, no matter what the movie, doing more or less the same thing each time.  Speaking of eras, The Incredible Burt Wonderstone begins in 1982 and gets the details right, from Judas Priest on the soundtrack to a top-loading VHS player that will provoke nostalgia in all those who can remember - those things were tanks.

"Steve Carell plays a couples counselor in Hope Springs.Steve Carell plays a couples counselor in Hope Springs. Relationship drama. Starring Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell. Directed by David Frankel. (PG-13. 100 minutes.) Stories often end in marriage, but few movies are actually about marriage, about what happens to people and relationships years down the line. Yes, there are lots of adultery movies - they don't count, as the main action in those takes place outside the marriage, after all. (That's why it's adultery.) But movies about the interpersonal dynamics of a marriage, about how a marriage works and why it sometimes doesn't, are practically nonexistent. So Hope Springs gets credit going in just for taking on the subject, and then it does better than that. This is no lightweight comedy, contrary to some of the movie's cheerful and airy publicity photos. There may be laughs in it, but by and large Hope Springs is about as hilarious as an angry, stone-faced Tommy Lee Jones at couples counseling: funny in theory, but in practice, unsettling. In fact - this is its chief virtue - Hope Springs borders on unsparing. In a pre-credits sequence, Meryl Streep is shown in a nightgown, fluffing up her hair and getting ready to go to her husband. She finds him sitting in his separate bedroom reading a golf magazine, and when she suggests (without coming out and asking) that they have sex, he begs off, saying, I had pork for lunch. Again, that's almost funny, perhaps even enough to laugh, but neither Vanessa Taylor's screenplay nor David Frankel's direction forces the humor. They stay focused on this moment and others as examples of what can happen to love after 31 years of marriage. And not just love, but life, joy, conversation, hope. The marriage in Hope Springs is like the last weigh station before the grave, with silent breakfasts, no physical warmth and evenings spent with the wife puttering in the kitchen while the husband falls asleep watching the Golf Channel. If anything, the filmmakers lay it on too thick, but then there was no way Streep wasn't going to make the wife's despair felt, or that Jones wasn't going to turn the husband into the sternest, most intractable and least smiling man ever to end up in couples therapy. Everyone involved took the characters and their dilemma seriously, and that's a good thing. Streep is a marvel - she always is. She creates a portrait of a sheltered woman with grand yearnings, without much experience and few adventures, but she definitely wants something - nothing specific, just something rather than nothing. Like an anniversary present that's more personal than a new water heater.  But in the end, this is really Jones' movie, and the drama takes place inside him. He's the one who makes us wonder, and he's the one we watch. In retrospect, both Frankel and Jones show a real command of the film's tone, in that Jones is able to take his character right up to the edge: Just a little more nasty, just a little more cold, and the movie would collapse. We would stop having hope for this guy, stop seeing the movie as emblematic of some marriages in general and start seeing it as depicting an isolated example of a rotten husband.  Skillfully and with delicacy, Jones shows the person under the hard shell, not the whole person - people can't be revealed so easily - but enough so that we don't think the wife is crazy for seeing something there.  Hope Springs is not about the big horrible things that happen to people, like death and illness and financial ruin, but the small horrible things that can happen: how people can respond to pain by narrowing their lives, how doing the same job for years, day in and day out, can narrow one's interests, and how getting older and thinking you know how every social encounter will turn out can keep you planted on the couch forever.  It's not much of a comedy - even Steve Carell, as the therapist, plays it straight here. But it's very effective as a cautionary tale.",1
"Stop-Loss: Drama. Starring Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum and Abbie Cornish. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) The military's stop-loss policy allows the U.S. government to keep calling back soldiers for multiple tours of duty in Iraq. The human consequences of this policy are explored in Stop-Loss, the latest from Kimberly Peirce, who is best known for directing (and co-writing) Boys Don't Cry.  Obviously, with a title like Stop-Loss, it's no surprise that this is a movie about a soldier who gets stop-lossed. But a lot happens between the opening credits and the soldier's order to report back to duty. In that long interval, the film establishes its attention to atmosphere and its respect for the Army, its culture and the kinds of communities from which soldiers spring. Clearly, Peirce's motives are pure. She's not using the stop-loss issue as a wedge to make the government or the administration look bad. She's using it to dramatize an injustice and to advocate on behalf of the soldiers.  And so she begins where she should begin, in Iraq, on a seemingly routine day at a checkpoint. Then something happens, and, in the blink of an eye, these young men find themselves in a narrow alley, with machine gun fire and rockets raining down on them from the rooftops. It's harrowing, men are killed and another soldier is blinded and crippled. We realize that every day this could happen, and that on some days it does happen, so it's understandable that every soldier in Iraq ends up counting the days until his duty is done and he gets to go home, alive and in one piece. As in Boys Don't Cry, Peirce, who wrote the screenplay for Stop-Loss, has a feel for small-town life, for the things rowdy young people say and for how they act when drunk. Prior to their discharge, the men go back to their Texas town and enjoy a weekend pass. They hook up with friends, relatives and girlfriends they haven't seen in months and drink and carry on all night. In these scenes, Peirce does a number of important things - and she does them all at the same time. She establishes the nature of the town, acknowledging both the expansiveness of its spirit and the narrowness of its worldview. She also gives us a feel for what these fellows are like when they relax. These are young, testosterone-driven fellows who like to get drunk and shoot guns. This is what they were like before they joined the Army. It might be why they joined the Army in the first place.  And yet - Peirce does this subtly but unmistakably - she lets us know that the behavior we're seeing is beyond the usual Texas partying, that the things these fellows are doing on their first night back indicate young men in the grip of post-traumatic stress disorder. They can't stop. They're jumpy. Their moods are on a hair trigger. Under the best of circumstances, it's going to be a long road back. These guys have already paid their dues. And once we see that - not just know it, but feel it - Peirce has set up her story. She has taken us to the point that it's just unthinkable that these men should ever have to go through this again. In a way, that's the real beginning of the film. Before that is the prologue. Ryan Phillippe, as the young sergeant who gets stop-lossed, embodies a special sort of young man who is very much Army material - aggressive, enthusiastic and patriotic. Yet he's too smart not to know when he's being had, and too conscience-driven not to regret some of the things the Army has made him do. His superior intelligence and perception put him into conflict, for the first time, with his best friend (Channing Tatum), whose emotional structure makes him incapable of questioning authority. It's a nice performance from Tatum, as a guy who thinks he's trying to understand but who unconsciously knows he can't afford to.  Finally, there may be a star-making performance in Stop-Loss, that of Abbie Cornish, as our hero's childhood friend. As Michelle, she's blond, pretty and tough as hell. She drives a big old American car. She can down four Tequila shots in a row. She can unload an automatic pistol in two seconds, put the clip in her back pocket and make sure there's nothing in the breach. She is the iconic essence of young Texas womanhood, and, of course, she's Australian. This kid has a future. -- Advisory:Graphic violence and strong language.",1
"Stranger Than Fiction: Comedydrama. Starring Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman. Directed by Marc Foster. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle talks Stranger Than Fiction.]The first hint that Stranger Than Fiction is going to be more than just a laugh machine comes when we meet the novelist and narrator. Played by Emma Thompson in uncompromising terms, Kay is an unpleasant, self-destructive wreck, stuck in a living hell of writer's block. Her living space is spare, just the bare necessities plus an electric typewriter, and she looks as if she could use a shower. Thompson doesn't play her as a caricature of a writer, but as a writer, possessed and oppressed by the struggle to finish her book. The honesty of Thompson's performance, its pursuit of quirky, disturbing truths over soft cliches, is typical of the entire movie. In the film's fantasy construct, mild-mannered IRS manager Harold Crick -- played by Will Ferrell, in a departure from his usual straight comic roles -- is not someone invented by the novelist. He has an independent existence and lives in the same world that she does. Nonetheless, she seems to have control over his fate, in that whatever she writes about him happens immediately. He is unaware of this, until one morning, brushing his teeth, he hears her voice in his head -- the voice of Thompson at her most poised and supercilious -- describing his every action, interaction and thought. The voice is so present that he can't believe no one else can hear it. The spectacle of Ferrell reacting with anxiety and frustration at hearing his life narrated makes for many good comic moments -- not the least of which is when the narrator mentions, in passing, Harold's imminent death, and he becomes frantic. At the same time, screenwriter Zach Helm finds a way to keep the narration from suffocating the movie: Harold hears the narration only intermittently, for a few hours each day, when Kay is writing. Most of the movie is like a comic variation on D.O.A., the old film noir in which a man, fatally poisoned but not dead yet, goes on a frantic search for the person who murdered him. Here, the man is just as frantic to find the author, but his symptoms suggest schizophrenia. The only one who will humor him at all is a literary theorist, played with skewed wit by Dustin Hoffman, who helps Harold figure out what genre of story he's living in. The possibility of a romance with a politically radical baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lends hope that his life might turn out to be a romantic comedy, but tragedy may be around the next corner. In a film that easily could have been cold or ironical, Ferrell provides the emotional thrust. There becomes something surprisingly poignant about witnessing the process of a regimented personality -- solitary in his life, obsessive-compulsive in his routines -- opening himself up to direct experience. Director Marc Foster keeps the tone out of the realm of schmaltz and guides Ferrell to a credible, effective performance. If there's a point to Stranger Than Fiction, except as a divertissement, it's open to discussion. It can be seen as a caustic commentary on the artistic personality. It can be seen as a celebration of the power of art to transform lives. It can be seen as a story about how characters can educate their creators, or as a metaphor for the human condition. Take your pick, but one thing is clear: It's too good not to be regarded as something. It's not the deepest piece of work, but it's hardly frivolous, and it connects with us because there's something about it we inevitably recognize as real. -- Advisory: This film contains sexuality and brief profanity.

"Street Kings: Crime thriller. Starring Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker. Directed by David Ayer. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)  There's a lot to appreciate in Street Kings, a tight, propulsive action thriller, but there's one thing to marvel at, and that's James Ellroy's command of story. The best-selling crime novelist co-wrote the movie's screenplay, but he wrote the story all by himself, and it really is a thing of beauty. It's satisfying and consistently surprising, and yet those surprises are always appropriate and right, and the directions Ellroy chooses are invariably better and wiser than anything anybody might have guessed.  To give an example of the kind of thing Ellroy does, he will introduce a plot element that you think will take the whole movie to resolve - and then he'll resolve it in some unexpected way in the very next scene. It's as if he's watching the movie, too, and knows what the audience wants (so he provides it immediately) and what the audience expects (so he does the opposite). It's safe to say that there isn't a major scene in Street Kings in which Ellroy doesn't figure out a way to do something that breaks the pattern.Keanu Reeves is at the center of the movie, playing a tough cop on a hair trigger, and while Reeves has never seemed the hair-trigger type, he finds a way to make the role work for him. It helps that at 43, he has lost his doe-eyed, innocent look. Reeves helps himself further by not trying to be a hard case but rather by playing the detective as reserved and contained. After a while, this combination of a reserved exterior and violent behavior conveys the idea of a guy who's dangerous because he's reserved; he's so bottled up, he's about to explode. The opening sequence throws us right into this man's world. He lives alone. He wakes up and immediately throws up - a wordless commentary on his life. He buys little bottles of vodka, the kind found in hotel mini-bars, and downs them when he's driving. Yet when he's thrown into a situation of mortal danger, he suddenly becomes the consummate professional. That's when he comes alive. Tom (Reeves) is the star of an elite detective unit, a band of brothers headed by a captain played by Forest Whitaker. Reeves' successful performance in Street Kings is a fairly straightforward affair, the product of adopting a simple strategy and sticking to it. Whitaker's performance is more complicated, the result of meticulous planning combined with brilliant, in-the-moment inspiration. The captain is a big brother and a lovable fellow, a fundamentally simple person, but one who has seen so much of the dark side that he really can't be simple anymore. The action of Street Kings involves Tom going around to the various armpits of Los Angeles, investigating the murder of a fellow officer - even as Internal Affairs, in the person of a sly captain (Hugh Laurie), suspects that maybe Tom himself might have been behind the cop's death. As such, the story has echoes of the old Hitchcock number, in which a wrongly accused man looks for the real culprits, though with Ellroy telling the story, the plot has so many bells and whistles that you'd never recognize it. David Ayer, who directed, is best known as a screenwriter (Training Day), but he had no hand in the screenplay.In Street Kings he shows he can present urban squalor with the best of them, but more important than that, he films the action in a refreshingly unflashy way, standing back so we can see it, letting the moments of conflict speak for themselves without shaking the camera to suggest panic. He doesn't try to announce himself as a director. He just tells the story, briskly and economically. He keeps it moving and packs a lot into 107 minutes. A more ostentatious director would have found a way to stretch things to two hours, minimum. Ayer just serves the story, and the audience. At the screening I attended, the crowd got a big kick out of famous faces turning up in featured roles. Of particular note is Cedric the Entertainer, who makes a case for himself in a dramatic role, as a small-time drug dealer. -- Advisory: Strong violence and adult language.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Stuck on You: Comedy. Starring Matt Damon, Greg Kinnear, Wen Yann Shih and Cher. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) People take comedy for granted, but to step back and think about Stuck on You is to be impressed by the invention and sheer exuberance of the picture, which isn't great but sure is enjoyable. Matt Damon plays Bob, and Greg Kinnear plays Walt, two fellows joined at the hip since birth. Walt looks about 10 years older, but we're told that that's because Bob got most of the twins' shared liver. To appreciate why the Farrellys are the Farrellys, consider this: Any other comedy writers making a movie about conjoined twins would have tried to milk laughs out of the twins' exasperation and frustration with each other. One would have been neat, the other a slob; one would have been a Democrat, the other a Republican. But the Farrellys are too smart for that. They know that bickering might be amusing for five minutes, but two hours of it would wipe an audience out. Instead, Bob and Walt love each other. They own a fast-food joint in Martha's Vineyard, and their moves are in perfect synch as they flip the burgers and put them into the buns. They're gentle and respectful and make an effort to accommodate each other's interests. One hysterically funny scene: At a community theater, the extroverted Walt performs in the one-man show Tru, about Truman Capote, while the introverted Bob, dressed in black and trying not to be noticed, sweats profusely. When they go to Hollywood, they are spotted by Cher (played by herself), who is trying to get out of a commitment to star in a TV show. Since her contract gives her the choice of co-star, she chooses Walt, figuring that the network will break the contract. Instead, they go ahead with Walt, and the scenes of him on the video playback -- framed so that Bob can't be seen -- provide some of the biggest laughs in a movie loaded with them. Having established Bob as shy, the Farrellys devise a series of excruciating situations for him -- most notably, when Walt arranges for him to meet the young woman with whom he's been having an Internet flirtation. Damon brings lots of sweetness to the role, and he's nicely paired with the delicately pretty Wen Yann Shih. Similarly, Walt wants to be a star, and so the Farrellys find contexts for him to taste life at the top. Kinnear is excellent as Walt, alternately full of self-delusion and self-knowledge. The Farrellys' movies, especially this one, have an essential warmth that can't be faked. That warmth keeps their films out of the realm of mean- spiritedness and gets audiences through those patches where the laughs aren't coming fast and furious. The Farrellys may subject their characters to terrible agonies of embarrassment, but they never quite mock them. They love them -- and that, as much as their outrageous humor, is at the heart of their appeal. -- Advisory: This film contains crude sexual talk and situations. ",1
"Super Size Me: Documentary. Starring Morgan Spurlock. Directed by Morgan Spurlock. (Not rated. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That the documentary comes across as more than a sermon has a lot to do with Spurlock's personality, which is outgoing and instantly engaging. An on- camera natural with a David Letterman-like zaniness, Spurlock doesn't limit his film to the spectacle of one man's eating like a slob, but pursues a more ambitious and fruitful vein. Over the course of Super Size Me, he travels all over the country, interviewing consumers, investigating school lunch programs and showing the insidious ways that fattening food has come to dominate the American diet, just in the past generation. He also monitors his health, through regular blood tests and examinations by a trio of physicians and a nutritionist. The results of your liver (blood test) are obscene, his general practitioner tells him, when Spurlock is barely two-thirds through the month. The McDonald's diet proves so damaging that within three weeks his cardiologist is advising the young and previously healthy Spurlock on what to do in case of a heart attack. Wanting to confirm that a fast-food diet is unhealthy, Spurlock adopted several ground rules for his fast-food experiment. He had to eat at McDonald's three times a day, and he had to eat nothing else. Over the course of the month, he had to try everything on the McDonald's menu. And whenever someone behind the counter said, Do you want me to super size that? he had to answer, Yes. He found that he was asked to super size most often in Texas, which turns out to have some of the fattest cities in the country. Coincidence? Maybe. Anyone who has ever been through a fast-food phase, or is in the midst of one now, will recognize the patterns that Spurlock exhibits in the film. By mealtime, he's starving. He's diving into the food. Midway into meals, he's out of breath. By the end of the meal, he's stuffed. He has what he calls McGas and a McStomachache. Yet within a couple of hours, he's hungry again. He feels rotten most of the time, and he has trouble sleeping. At the start of the movie, at a lean 6 foot 2 and 185 pounds, Spurlock is bounding up the stairs and is in perpetually cheerful spirits. Within days, climbing the stairs is an effort, and by mid-month he's suffering from free- floating depression. He's only happy at mealtimes. (This is the best part of the day, he says, when I get to be fat on the bed with my Coke.) His eyes are puffy, and by the end of the month he looks a good five years older than when he started. Super Size Me is full of interesting facts about the American diet. We are apparently in the midst of an obesity epidemic, which has coincided with the increased frequency with which Americans are eating out. The foods that are most heavily advertised are the ones most eaten, and all the big money is behind fast-food and junk food. Many school lunch programs are handled by companies that win their contracts through low bidding, and many school lunches consist of little more than candy, French fries, hamburgers and pizza -- high calorie, high blood-sugar items that provide a quick rush, followed by lethargy. It's a recipe for disruptive, exhausted students. Spurlock shows one atypical school lunch program that provides healthy, nutritious, fresh food and does it for roughly the same cost as the junk-food lunches. The healthy food results in kids that behave better and have longer attention spans. While watching Super Size Me, one must remember that nobody is forcing anybody to eat fast food, and everyone has the right to say no. Yet Spurlock raises some important questions: Is it really fair to expect children to be strong enough to withstand an incessant media barrage -- or to choose the celery instead of the pizza in the high school cafeteria? When Spurlock shows how kids are being targeted by the fast-food industry, his contention that sinister, or at least cynical, forces are at work begins to look plausible. ",1
"Swing Vote: Comedy-drama. Starring Kevin Costner, Madeline Carroll, Kelsey Grammer and Dennis Hopper. Directed by Joshua Michael Stern. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) It's not easy to play a stupid guy. The temptations are everywhere - to wink at the audience as if to say, I'm smart, actually - or to try to make being stupid a form of adorable. Kevin Costner plays a good-natured idiot in Swing Vote, a middle-aged man who has squandered what little potential he had in favor of life as a hard-drinking good-for-nothing, and he gives a remarkable performance.  It's not the kind of role that wins Oscars, because Academy Awards usually go to actors playing high-status roles, powerful souls, either good or evil. By contrast, Bud, the likable loser in Swing Vote, is low status all the way, a man who can barely function socially, whose instincts are all wrong, whose impulses are either vulgar or diffident. Costner slips right into that mode of being, bringing to the characterization precision, observation and a heretofore unexploited flair for physical comedy. If the advance advertising has communicated one thing about this movie, you already know that it's about an average fellow (actually, below average) whose single vote will determine the winner of the presidential election. The scenario is this: It all comes down to New Mexico's electoral votes, and the popular vote in New Mexico is tied. However, Bud's ballot was never tallied, and so he has the right to cast a written ballot - in effect, to choose the winner. Political junkies are an obvious natural constituency for this movie, and they will be amused by the presentation of the candidates and their political ads. Kelsey Grammer is the Republican incumbent, a borderline idiot, and Dennis Hopper plays the Democratic challenger, the perfect image of the kind of liberal candidate that inevitably loses, two parts Mondale and one part Dukakis, with just a dash of Kucinich. When he goes skeet shooting with Bud, the recoil of the rifle sends him flying backward. The campaign comes down to a crazy effort to court one man's vote, and so each candidate starts pandering - with the Republican posing as a pro-gay marriage environmentalist and the Democrat espousing anti-abortion, anti-immigration positions - in television ads that are the comic highlight of the picture. However, anyone who approaches the movie with hopes of finding a serious elucidation of an intriguing political hypothetical will be disappointed. For example, until I realized it was not that kind of movie, I wanted to know who was ahead in the national popular vote (an important weight to throw in the balance in a deadlocked election). I also kept waiting for the candidates to get serious in discussing the issues with Bud. But, of course, such a story direction would have led to a dead end, a polemic for one side or the other.  The movie's real interest isn't in political issues so much as in presenting Bud as an archetype of a certain kind of American, living on the fringes, with little sense of the world around him. The script, by Jason Richman and director Joshua Michael Stern, is very good at showing us the thought patterns of a guy who really doesn't know how life works or how to comport himself outside his limited sphere. The scenes between Bud and the political honchos that come courting him are painfully accurate portrayals of someone whose social compulsion is to bring everything down to a comfortable level of clowning, even if it means being perceived as a buffoon. Costner has the internal workings of this guy down, and he's well matched by young Madeline Carroll, who plays his precocious, loving daughter, an adult's mind in a child's body.  The movie is a bit long. Sometimes the audience is ahead of the story, and the setup itself has some built-in challenges that no script could have overcome. But the mix of comedy and drama is winning; Costner couldn't be better, and the little girl is a find. The film is characterized by fine performances throughout, including that of Mare Winningham, who turns up in a single scene and brings to it a whole anguished life history. Real-life political reporters and commentators, such as Chris Matthews and Campbell Brown, make appearances. Arianna Huffington has the agony of actually having to say, Somewhere Franklin and Jefferson are smiling, as though either founder would have liked the prospect of an idiot choosing the president. Not likely. After all, it was Jefferson, the ultimate democrat among the founders, who said, If a nation expects to be ignorant and free ... it expects what never was and never will be. Jefferson would not be smiling on Bud. Bud was his worst nightmare. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language.",1
"TADPOLE: Comedy. Starring Aaron Stanford, Sigourney Weaver, Bebe Neuwirth and John Ritter. Directed by Gary Winick. (PG-13. 77 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) And not just any older woman. Young Oscar, known as Tadpole when he was a little boy, is obsessed with his stepmother, Eve (Sigourney Weaver). Something of an aesthete, Oscar speaks French, reads Voltaire and just isn't interested in girls his own age. On a train going home to Manhattan for Thanksgiving, he gives the cold shoulder to one of his female classmates, telling a friend that he doesn't like the girl's hands. She has hands like a child. Tadpole will delight audiences for its comedy -- especially in the scenes between Oscar and Eve's randy best friend, Diane (Bebe Neuwirth). But the movie also has value for the way it explores a particular kind of boy's apprehension at the gates of adolescence. As a friend tells him, You're like a 40-year-old trapped in a 15-year-old's body. Acting 40 is easy. Navigating 15, 16 and 17 -- that's the hard part. The Eve fixation, then, can be seen not as merely some random odd attraction but as a manifestation of an unexpressed anxiety. Oscar wants to go from the safety of childhood to the coziness of middle age without having to muddle through the chaos of his teen years. He doesn't want to give up valuing books and great music to conform to the teen norm. No surprise then that his longing leads him in the direction of his stepmother, who is kind and accomplished, values learning and appreciates Oscar's mind. Between moments of ribald comedy, Tadpole demonstrates the filmmakers' sensitive understanding of the subtleties of human emotion. When Oscar (Aaron Stanford) speaks to Eve, we sense the charge in the air and notice his strained effort to be erudite and clever, but we can also tell that Eve would not pick up on it. The idea of his being attracted is the farthest thing from her mind. It's not the farthest thing from her friend Diane's mind, however. People will walk out of Tadpole talking especially about Neuwirth, who is mischievous and funny as a sexy chiropractor who starts off giving Oscar a back rub and ends up taking him to bed. Alas, when the young man wakes up the next morning he doesn't quite appreciate his good luck. This is what Shaw meant about youth being wasted on the young. The age gap between Stanford (who is in his early 20s but looks 15) and Neuwirth, who is in her early 40s, is right for the story. The casting of Weaver as Eve stretches things. Eve is supposed to be a former classmate of Diane's, but Weaver is almost 10 years older than Neuwirth, and the age gap between Weaver and Stanford appears insuperable. Then again, perhaps that's as it should be. In any case, Weaver brings an undertone of sadness to Eve that's an important element. Tadpole is about sex, but it's also about teenage angst and middle-aged angst and about how each can help cure the other. The movie also touches on a certain kind of know-it-all, seen-it-all, benign middle-aged oblivion, nicely embodied by John Ritter, who plays Oscar's genial but clueless father. . This film contains sexual situations. ",1
"TALK TO HER: Drama. Starring Javier Camara, Dario Grandinetti, Leonor Watling and Rosario Flores. Directed by Pedro Almodovar. (R. 112 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) This is Almodovar's stab at serious drama, and the result is bizarre and affecting but also unsettling in ways that the filmmaker may not have intended. To be sure, Almodovar wants to disturb audiences, but is he aware of the misogyny and sexual panic blaring like a siren from the screen? Like the characters, Talk to Her seems to revere women without wanting to get close, to love the idea of women but not their physical reality. The picture begins with a performance of a Pina Bausch dance piece, showing women careening blindly around a stage, while men rush about moving furniture out of their way. Marco (Dario Grandinetti), a journalist, watches and is moved to tears. Equally moved is Benigno (Javier Camara), a nurse who happens to be sitting next to him. The men don't quite know why they're moved, but it becomes apparent: The dance piece depicts a male-female dynamic that appeals to their needs to facilitate, comfort and avoid direct contact. For a while, Talk to Her plays as though it will be a conventional drama. Marco wants an interview with Lydia (Rosario Flores), a famous bullfighter, and he realizes that he loves her, even when she's not wearing the matador outfit. But Lydia is in love with someone else -- so tragically in love that when she's horribly gored in the bullring, there's some ambi- guity about whether it was an accident or an attempted suicide. Accident or suicide, Almodovar has Lydia struck down when she dares to assume the male role. At the hospital, it's revealed that Lydia is in a coma from which there will be no return, but Marco keeps sitting vigil. And that's how he meets Benigno, who is the personal nurse to Alicia (Leonor Watling), a dancer who has been comatose for four years. Benigno must be doing a fine job taking care of her because Alicia is quite voluptuous and lovely for a woman in a vegetative state. Benigno, whom the movie implies is gay, gives Alicia daily sponge baths with the thoroughness and devotion that straight men usually reserve for their sports cars. Benigno is an odd one, but Talk to Her makes a case that Benigno's eccentricities are virtues in disguise. What difference does it make, the movie suggests, if Benigno gets off on Alicia's powerlessness and neutralized sexuality, so long as he keeps talking to her and caring for her? Maybe the world needs such odd folks to do jobs such as this. The picture takes its most outrageous and strange turn when Benigno starts to tell Alicia about a silent movie he's seen. It's a mock silent film, Almodovar's own creation, called The Shrinking Lover, about a man who keeps shrinking but keeps trying to make love to a woman. It's a metaphor for a man feeling dwarfed by the power of a woman's beauty and the scale of her physicality, and it ends with the shrinking lover getting so tiny he walks into the woman's vagina and disappears forever. Anyone else who had a fantasy like that might feel obliged to keep it to himself and quietly seek help, but such moments are what makes Almodovar Almodovar. Just don't be fooled into thinking that Talk to Her is a movie about love. It's about worship and fascination and that other emotion that often has a way of lurking underneath them: fear. ",1
"TAPE: Drama. Starring Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman. Directed by Richard Linklater. (R. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Like most movies by Linklater, it's the kind of film that doesn't usually get made -- a dramatic chamber piece for young people. Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard play a pair of childhood friends who reunite in their hometown of Lansing, Mich., when one of them gets a film into a local festival. It has been 10 years since high school, and the men are going in different directions. Leonard plays Jon, a filmmaker who is beginning to find success; and Hawke is Vince, who does drugs, deals drugs and lives an aimless life. Hawke is the movie's revelation. Though it's not uncommon for him to play slackers, Hawke doesn't give Vince his usual boyish charm. There's an angry edge to Vince, a possibility of violence that's always present. He's the kind of guy whom everyone wants to fix, and he's not happy about it. Meanwhile Jon is the kind of young man anyone would admire -- and Vince isn't happy about that, either. So their encounter is, from the beginning, a bit fraught, though on the surface, there's the usual backslapping, old-pal stuff. Jon thinks his friend is a mess and would like to help him, while Vince resents Jon's accomplished and successful life -- resents it more than Jon could possibly realize. For the first 10 minutes, Tape seems as though it's going to be just an encounter between two old friends, a conversation that's interesting but goes nowhere, like a lot of Linklater pictures. But Linklater didn't write this one. Tape was written by Stephen Belber, who adapted his own play. The drama builds, and soon Vince is accusing Jon of having raped a mutual girlfriend 10 years before. Nothing is too neat, and viewers may leave Tape unsure whether the rape really happened -- and likewise unsure of how the writer and director think we should feel about it. The movie, tantalizing in what is left unspoken, is more concerned with the interplay of the characters and the relationship of each to his past. These are people just old enough to get screwed up by their past. Leonard, an accomplished stage actor, is ideal as the upstanding foil for Hawke's malicious miscreant. And Uma Thurman, as the former high school girlfriend, brings an elusive quality to the role of a highly functional woman who thrives by burying her pain. Vince goes through the film convinced not only that he is morally superior to Jon but also that Jon's lack of ethics is the cause of his success. The reason you are where you are today is because you always insist on getting your way, Vince tells him. The question remains open for most of the picture. In addition to bringing out three fine performances, Linklater makes his presence felt in Tape by using odd and yet revealing camera angles -- a close-up of a shoe hitting the floor or a beer can opening. Look also for a reference to Hitchcock's Marnie. It goes by in a flash. ",1
"THE BANGER SISTERS: Comedy. Starring Goldie Hawn, Susan Sarandon and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Bob Dolman. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What The Banger Sisters offers in place of an eloquent statement is the charm of two actresses at the top of their game in flashy roles and a smart script that's decidedly more coarse than sentimental. The dearth of sentiment is a particular relief, considering that the movie is, after all, a movie about two gal pals who meet in middle age after 20 years apart. This is no Beaches. There's an anarchy to writer-director Bob Dolman's humor that consistently sneaks up and smacks us -- and makes The Banger Sisters worth seeing. The picture is about two women who, in the days when they and rock 'n' roll were young, were famous groupies. Thirty years later, each has a different relationship with their scandalous past. Goldie Hawn plays Suzette, who has never grown up. She works in a rock club, lives in an apartment that hasn't been redecorated in 30 years and still tries to pick up musicians. Lavinia, played by Susan Sarandon, is, by contrast, running from her past. Married to a wealthy lawyer, she has reinvented herself as the fussy mom of two teenage daughters and dresses in a prim style that Mamie Eisenhower might have considered conservative. Her husband and daughters know nothing of her previous life, nor of her collection of vintage Polaroids -- close-ups of the private parts of the musicians she has known in the biblical sense. It's a whole lot of Polaroids. One day Suzette decides to get into her car and drive to Phoenix, to visit Lavinia and maybe hit her up for a loan. Inevitably, the movie has to throw them together and let the sparks fly, but before it does, The Banger Sisters introduces Harry, a phobic writer whom Suzette picks up on the road. Harry -- Suzette's temperamental opposite -- is played by Geoffrey Rush, who in this role turns out to be a gifted comic. The contrast between Harry's fastidiousness and Suzette's sloppiness, emotionally and morally, make for some of the best scenes in the film. Harry is the ideal victim, easily befuddled. The scenes also benefit from the fact that Dolman, in his capacity as screenwriter, understands Suzette completely. He gives her a distinct crudeness of expression that is occasionally off- putting, usually funny and always true to character. However, Dolman's understanding of Lavinia is considerably less absolute. In the old days, Lavinia was a stereotypical free spirit, and now she is a stereotypically uptight mom. It's up to Sarandon to help us make the connection between the Vinny of legend and the bug-eyed matron whom she plays to comic effect. Hawn and Sarandon exude an ease and pleasure in working together. Sarandon's real-life daughter, Eva Amurri, throws herself into the role of Vinny's hideously spoiled younger daughter to amusing effect. Erika Christensen's luck is not as good. She plays the older daughter and is saddled with the movie's one and only cringe scene -- a high school valedictory speech that is the screenwriter's cloying attempt to sum up the movie. A sense of loss creeps into The Banger Sisters in the second half -- 30 years on, the old days are dead, and so are a lot of the fellows immortalized in the Polaroid collection. If the movie had a chance at greatness, it might have found it in pursuing this sense of loss. The movie pursues a sense of humor instead, and that's the next best thing. ",1
"THE BANK: Drama. Starring Anthony LaPaglia, David Wenham and Sibylla Budd. Directed by Robert Connolly. (Not rated. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The picture, from Australia, was released Down Under last year, though it tells the kind of story one expects we'll see coming out of Hollywood a year from now. It blends an intriguing concept with a suspenseful plot, and the result is a gripping 103 minutes at the movies. It opens today at the Roxie Cinema and Rafael Film Center. The concept centers on a mathematical formula that Jim (David Wenham), a down-to-earth genius, is perfecting. He believes he'll soon be able to predict the slightest fluctuations of the stock market. Anthony LaPaglia plays a Melbourne bank CEO who decides to bring the mathematician on board, to fund his research and reap the benefits of what promises to be the ultimate in inside information. LaPaglia, who recently starred in another fine Australian film, Lantana, is an actor on a roll. His screen persona, from film to film, is that of a man in an unending state of either mild or aggravated irritation. And yet, within those seeming confines, he is able to work wonders. In The Bank, he lends the CEO nuances of charm and humor and, in a perverse way, becomes the movie's most admirable and attractive character. He is the one person in the film who seems impervious to fear. He doesn't have to act threatening, because he is threatening. In one scene, when Jim expresses surprise that the CEO knows intimate details of his private life, he answers, I'm like God, with a better suit. A small weakness of The Bank is that for its first 40 minutes or so, it follows two stories, and though the audience knows that the two have to link up eventually, the second story is not as immediately absorbing as the first. It's about a couple (Steve Rodgers and Mandy McElhinney) whose houseboat business is being foreclosed because of the bank's shady practices. But things pick up fairly quickly. Writer-director Robert Connolly creates an atmosphere of tension in which no one can be trusted, including, possibly, the pretty young teller (Sibylla Budd) with whom Jim starts an affair. After all, he barely knows her. Shouldn't we know each other better first? he asks, as they stumble in from a bar and start tearing off each other's clothes. But we might not like each other, she answers. Who could argue with that? The sense of unease is enhanced by an unusually strong soundtrack, written by Alan John and performed by a string-heavy orchestra. It's not the usual string-thrumming, imitation-Hitchcock movie sound but a dissonant and more modern effort that sounds less like Edward Herrmann than John Adams. The soundtrack does not remind one of a lone psycho but of a frenetic (and fairly psycho) world. Advisory: This film contains strong language and sexual situations. ",1
"THE BOURNE IDENTITY: Spy thriller. Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Directed by Doug Liman. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are moments that feel just on the edge of silly, but that's the idea. Director Doug Liman intentionally walks a careful line. He plays it straight enough that the movie generates the suspense of a traditional thriller, but he keeps one toe and sometimes two in the zone of farce. The result is not only entertaining but also refreshing, a shameless crowd-pleaser with a healthy cynicism about itself. Based on the 1980 novel by the late Robert Ludlum, the picture stars Matt Damon as Bourne, a young man with amnesia who wakes up on an Italian fishing boat, recovering from two bullet wounds. He has no idea who he is, but he does have a Swiss bank account number implanted behind his ear, so a trip to Zurich seems in order. From the beginning, Liman does two things worth noting. First, he films European cities in a way that makes us feel we're there. The streets may be picturesque, but they also look old and narrow and, if not sinister, at least coldly impassive, as though people have been getting murdered here for centuries. Liman also doesn't miss an opportunity to create a sense of unease. For example, when Bourne gets to the bank, he is greeted by a receptionist (Kait Denison) whose manner is un- settling -- not menacing or hostile or anything easy to identify, just strange. As a consequence, we share Bourne's discomfort: Everywhere he goes, he's walking in blindfolded. Damon makes Bourne easy to like, playing him as a decent young fellow genuinely bemused by each turn of events. He keeps discovering powers he didn't know he had. He speaks several languages fluently. He also can fight. Two Swiss cops approach him with billy clubs, and within seconds he beats them unconscious. His safety deposit box only confuses him further. Who has a safety deposit box with money, six passports and a gun? he says. Many movies are about young men searching for their own identity in a hostile world. The Bourne Identity takes this plotline and renders it literal. The cops are after him in three different countries. Assassins are trying to kill him. If he walks down the street, he gets recognized. If he gets in a car, it's a car chase. Most of the movie pairs Damon with Franka Potente, who plays Marie, a young Swiss woman whom he pays to drive him to Paris. Potente (Run Lola Run), an exceptional actress, doesn't get to do much here but react to catastrophe and look dewy-eyed at Damon. But she does manage to suggest, if only in her manner, a woman so wild and aimless that she takes pleasure in the chaos Bourne brings. The Bourne Identity takes place against an international background that, to its participants, seems gravely important but to us seems zany. A lunatic African leader (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is threatening to embarrass the CIA by naming his contacts, and suits in the agency are scrambling to control the damage. One of them is played by Brian Cox, who goes through the movie scowling like Nixon. Another is his henchman, played by Chris Cooper, the kind of fellow who sits behind a desk and, in a Southern accent, says things like I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown. It doesn't matter that Bourne, even if killed, wouldn't be placed in a body bag. The line just sounds good. Liman's previous movies were Swingers, for which its star and writer Jon Favreau got most of the credit, and Go, a seemingly routine youth comedy that Liman turned into one of the best films of 1999. The Bourne Identity shows that Liman's deadpan, farcical directorial personality is adaptable enough to give life to an old genre and distinct enough not to get lost inside a summer blockbuster. He's someone worth watching. . Advisory: This movie contains violence. ",1
"THE CAT'S MEOW: Drama. Starring Kirsten Dunst, Eddie Izzard, Edward Herrmann and Cary Elwes. Directed by Peter Bogdanovich. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Bogdanovich keeps his head and keeps the film moving. His deft use of a single location (a luxury yacht), his intelligent handling of his ensemble cast and his graceful camera work mark this as a true return to form. The Cat's Meow may be modest in scope, but it's ambitious in its evocation of an American culture just past the crossroads -- an America entering the modern age and assuming media-made values. Ground zero in this new America is the yacht of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. The year is 1924, and he and his mistress, actress Marion Davies, are hosting a party for some of Marion's Hollywood friends. At the end of the party someone will end up dead, the victim -- so rumors have had it -- of murder. Movie fanatics will know the victim going in. But this isn't a picture just for movie fanatics. In the meantime, we get a pleasure cruise that's no pleasure cruise. Everyone is uncomfortable. Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard) is wooing Davies (Kirsten Dunst), and Hearst (Edward Herrmann) has suspicions. Meanwhile, filmmaker Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes) is hoping to stay in business by entering into a partnership with Hearst, a tough man to pin down. As Chaplin, Izzard will disappoint anyone expecting him to look or seem like the great comedian. Chaplin was thin and agile as a lynx in those days, while Izzard is heavy and earthbound. Chaplin was relentlessly charming, playful and seductive, while Izzard is calm and reserved. Having Izzard play Chaplin is like having Ed Harris play Fred Astaire -- right age, right height, right hairline, wrong actor. Yet Izzard makes his portrayal work on its own terms, presenting a sympathetic and believable portrait of an ardent man whose greatest love is his art. Dunst, by contrast, is completely satisfying. Already at 19 Dunst has the maturity to play the 27-year-old Davies, and she resembles her, too. She has the right coloring, and she has a similarly sneaky-looking mouth. Most important, she captures the actress' warmth. Davies is one of those rare Hollywood figures whom absolutely everyone liked. Scour books and magazines looking for a bad word about her and you'll come up empty-handed. Dunst helps audiences understand why. Also onboard is newspaper columnist Louella Parsons, played by Jennifer Tilly, who, in a blink of an eye, has gone from sex kitten to sly character actress; and Elinor Glyn, the British novelist and social diva who coined the phrase It Girl. Much of the action is seen through the jaded eyes of Glyn, played with sardonic aplomb by Joanna Lumley (of TV's AbFab). The Cat's Meow gives Bogdanovich a chance to wink at the audience in the scene in which Hearst demolishes a room -- a homage to Citizen Kane. But the film has more than this sort of fun to offer. A moment from a dinner scene exemplifies the point of view: Glyn describes a disease that comes upon everyone in Hollywood -- an obsession with work, with status, with ego. The fact that 78 years later, those obsessions don't seem like a disease but like the norm shows how the values aboard that yacht have gone on to blanket the rest of the country -- like a fog.  This film contains one graphic instance of violence. ,4 ",1
"THE GOOD GIRL: Black comedy. Starring Jennifer Aniston, Jake Gyllenhaal and John C. Reilly. Directed by Miguel Arteta. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) So let me just admit to a certain resistance to The Good Girl, despite its merits as a movie. Aniston does a fine job playing a depressed, aimless young woman, but there's nothing more difficult about this role than her others. Perhaps there's just something about the spectacle of a comic actress not smiling and underacting that wows people. But since so many actresses can be wan, and so few can be Jennifer Aniston, it's hard to see how this constitutes a great breakthrough. She plays Justine, a 30-year-old department store clerk who lives in the kind of small Texas town that gives city people the heebie-jeebies just to think about. There's not much economic opportunity and not much recreation -- just drudgery by day and the TV set at night. Justine's husband, Phil (John C. Reilly), a housepainter, is both a nice guy and a pathetic pothead, which makes him hard to leave and yet impossible to respect. He's a pig, she says. He talks, but he doesn't think. Director Miguel Arteta films the department store scenes with a quality of bemused detachment, and the effect is comic and yet a bit heartless. Through a wide-angle lens, he gives us the entire sales floor, and the idea of spending eight hours straight there, under those lights, becomes almost suffocating. No wonder Justine feels trapped. At the start of the movie, Justine is looking for someone, anyone, who is as miserable as she is, because she needs to talk, and she can't take seriously anybody who's happy. One day her eyes connect with a teenage sales clerk named Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose adolescent angst is a fair match for her adult angst. I saw in your eyes that you hate the world, she says. I hate it, too. If The Good Girl has a flaw, it's a certain lack of humanity. The problem is not that Arteta and screenwriter Mike White don't care about Justine's husband and her co-workers. The problem is that they're not even interested in them. The filmmakers are too willing to rely on cliches and dismissive shorthand in filling out the background characters. So we get a picture of small-town life as seen through the prism of big-city prejudice. But The Good Girl has a great strength, too, namely in its uncompromising willingness to let the story go where the characters take it. Justine may be the protagonist, but she has weaknesses in her character. She's not brave, and she's not fully evolved, and she's not fully aware. She knows she's hurting, but she doesn't admit her complicity in her own misery; nor is she willing to do what she needs to do to change things. She is only capable of acting spontaneously, which, in this case, means entering into an affair with an unbalanced teenage boy. In most movies, when a teenage boy goes to bed with a grown woman, it's presented from the adult-male perspective, as a one-shot gift from the universe. But The Good Girl is written in a way that recognizes just how destabilizing sex can be. Gyllenhaal plays Holden as without defenses, without the capacity for rational thought, as a creature made up entirely of nerve endings. Anyone nostalgic for their teen years might recognize themselves in Gyllenhaal's performance, remember how it felt -- and think again. . This film contains strong language, heavy drinking and sexual situations. ",1
"THE INSIDER: Drama. Starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann. (R. 160 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) These issues are of interest, but on their own they could not hold an audience rapt for more than 2 1/2 hours. What gives The Insider its extra dose of urgency is the big question swirling around it: Do we live in a democracy or an oligarchy? In considering that, The Insider takes its place in the tradition of Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Meet John Doe. The heroes are coarser and less perfect these days. Russell Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand, the industry insider, as a prickly and distant character, a fellow with collapsed body language and darting eyes. Crowe is young for the role -- the real Wi gand was in his early 50s -- but he brings two important elements: He is intrinsically appealing, and he believably conveys Wigand's hair-trigger temper. That capacity for anger, plus an ingrained sense of right and wrong, is what gets Wigand fired from his $300,000-a-year job as research and development manager for Brown & Williamson tobacco. It also leads him to tell his story to 60 Minutes -- with the encouragement of the show's segment producer, Lowell Bergman. Bergman is the other hero of the movie, not a labyrinthine character like Wigand but a more straightforward good guy. As played by Al Pacino, Bergman is unpretentious, unimpressed, honest in his personal dealings and professionally committed to the truth. In The Insider, Pacino gets to tell people off who fall short of his standards. Any movie where Pacino gets to tell people off is all right by me. In the early encounters between Wigand and Bergman, one can almost feel the reporter's excitement at having such a big fish on the line. Wigand knows something, and he wants to reveal it. He knows that his company chemically enhanced the effects of nicotine in its cigarettes, thus making them more addictive. Michael Mann (The Last of the Mohicans, Heat), who by now must be counted among the important contemporary filmmakers, directs the picture with a vigorousness that is not overly obtrusive. He uses six shots to show Pacino checking a number in the phone book and dialing it, but few viewers will notice the technique. They will just feel its effect: a sense of something momentous about to happen. In The Insider, if America is not a country completely run by monied interests, it is close. 60 Minutes, an American institution, is about to air its interview with Wigand when CBS higher-ups make it pull back. The fear is that lawsuits from the rich tobacco company could result in Brown & Williamson owning the network. With the exception of Bergman, the CBS crew comes off poorly. Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall), the 60 Minutes producer, is presented as an engaging fellow but a corporate lackey all the same. Christopher Plummer, as Mike Wallace, emerges as a more ambiguous, and thus more sympathetic, character, but he still has clay feet. He is a tough guy when dealing with easy targets, like Iranian politicians, but when the opponent is powerful, we see his tent fold up. We come away seeing him as more entertainer than journalist. The picture is long, but there is never a lull. Scenes have a chance to breathe, and performances get to build. Pacino and Crowe are at their best, but the supporting cast also shines. Diane Venora is superb as Wigand's wife, and Gina Gershon breaks out of the sexpot trap and stands out in two scenes as an icy CBS lawyer.  .. ",1
"THE LAST CASTLE: Action. Starring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini. Directed by Rod Lurie. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Redford is in that wonderful stage of his career and his art where every gesture has meaning. Whether he's supplying the meaning, through his performance, or we're supplying it, through our understanding of Redford, doesn't matter. When he sees an injustice and turns his head to look at the perpetrator, we feel the moral weight. He plays a former three-star general, and the aura -- of a man who has meant something to a lot of people for a long time -- is Redford's own. Gandolfini is at a different stage, one in which audiences like what they've seen so far but are still discovering what he can do. Here he plays a bookish colonel in charge of a military prison who finds out that Redford -- a hero stripped of his rank for insubordination -- will be serving time under his roof. The imminent presence of a legendary combat leader brings out all of the warden's insecurity. Though icy intellectuals come in all sizes, big guys like Gandolfini don't usually get to play them. The unusual casting of Gandolfini, not to mention the somewhat unlikely casting of Redford (who is no George C. Scott), creates the illusion that The Last Castle presents a straightforward struggle between good and evil. It doesn't, really, and one has to assume that the filmmakers know it. The Last Castle gives us two men on a collision course. The warden breaks the men's spirits, inflicts cruel punishments and sometimes even has prisoners killed. The general, conversely, inspires the men, with his quiet strength, to transcend their physical and mental bonds. He's a leader who gradually transforms a bunch of self-hating slobs into an army ready to take over the castle-like prison. Yet the strategic maneuvering and fireworks distract us from the central question: Is this really a good idea? Perhaps the key to The Last Castle comes in the brief and beautifully acted scene between Redford and Robin Wright Penn, in an uncredited cameo as his daughter. She arrives on visiting day, tells him he's a great man, but she wants nothing to do with him. In the moment, that seems harsh. Maybe she knows something. The Last Castle, on the surface, seems like a naive film about a great leader's capacity to inspire. But it's also about the clueless vanity and destabilizing allure of that kind of personality. Mark Ruffalo, as a cynical prisoner, spends a good deal of the movie trying to decide whether to follow his reason and self-interest -- or give in to the blind impulse to follow the daddy figure. Daddy makes the kids feel good, but it doesn't mean Father knows best. This is third film from director Rod Lurie that seems to mean one thing but means another upon reflection. Deterrence (1999) was the story of a president who drops a nuclear bomb on Baghdad, a man presented as a hero, but he's a monster. Likewise The Contender (2000), about a vice presidential nominee's confirmation hearings, pulled back from what seemed to be its premise -- that a candidate's private life is of no significance. Lurie is either brilliant, manipulating genre conventions to test his audience's ability to tease out moral issues -- or he can't think straight. But people who can't think straight usually don't make three good movies in a row. ",1
"THE LAST SAMURAI: Drama. Starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. Directed by Ed Zwick. (Rated R. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Either by accident or design - it would even be more interesting if they did it by accident - director and co-writer Ed Zwick and producer-star Tom Cruise have made a 19th century epic that gains its power by tapping into a host of contemporary terrors: the fear of modern weaponry, of cold commerce destroying nature and ancient culture, and of a vanishing American integrity. Cruise's undeniable star voltage makes it all palatable, and the film is gorgeous to behold and even to listen to, from the rolling green hills to the galloping horses to the Lohengrin-like theme music on the sound track. Just don't pinch yourself when Cruise comes riding up dressed as a samurai. There are moments in the film where, if the audience were to step back, even for a second, the whole edifice might collapse under a cascade of derisive laughter. For a man best known for his smile, Cruise takes himself very seriously. But then, why shouldn't he? Who better than Cruise - bearded and blue- eyed - to bear the weight of the Western man's sins? In The Last Samurai, he is stabbed, shot and beat up on multiple occasions, practically every other scene. Only later do we realize we've been witnessing, in effect, a purification rite, whereby he might toss away his old garb with his old life and assume the robes, first of a student and then of a warrior. He certainly starts the film in need of redemption. Capt. Algren (Cruise) is a Civil War hero turned drunk, trapped in a spiral of guilt that he can't assuage. As an Indian fighter, he participated in an act of genocide - the cold-blooded slaughter of an entire encampment of women and children. We first meet him in San Francisco, stumbling through a demonstration on behalf of Winchester rifles. Zwick shows us San Francisco in 1876, a three-second shot of a cable car going down a hill on a foggy night, and it's so beautiful and convincing it makes one wish the story might pause there. But no, Algren is off to Japan. His old Indian Wars commander, Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), whom Algren despises, gets him a job with the Japanese government. His assignment is to train the Japanese army in the use of American weaponry, so that they might put down a Samurai uprising. In one of the more vivid scenes, the Samurai emerge out of mist, in a forest, to lay waste to the untrained army. They're like monsters appearing out of the air, or like subconscious projections taking corporeal form. They're terrifying. When Algren becomes their prisoner, he gets to see the other side, and that's really where the movie begins. From the cramped, steamy streets of Tokyo, we're suddenly brought into a land of open spaces, spacious ancient temples, and houses with screens that let in the air and light. Algren can breathe - he can even sleep - and he begins to see a new way to live. This era in Japanese history, the climactic confrontation between the old Shogunate and Western-looking modernists, could have been told in a different way. It might have been as the story of a great people escaping the grip of medievalism and taking their rightful place among the nations of the world. But that's not the point of view at work here. The samurai are portrayed as disciplined and wise, and Zwick pans over the pagodas blending into the natural landscape as though he were already lamenting their loss -- and the Wal-Mart that might be there now. Ken Watanabe brings a calm power to his role as Katsumoto, the samurai leader, as well as a magnetism that allows him to hold the screen with Cruise. He may seem a bit too reasonable and affable for a real-life samurai chief - or even a samurai chief in a Kurosawa movie - but he's the samurai this movie needs. That Watanabe survives scenes in which the great leader does little but nod with wonder at Algren's wisdom is a measure of the actor's innate dignity. Zwick takes his time, lingering over Algren's bucolic idyll and delving into 19th century Japanese politics - the emperor here makes Joan of Arc's Dauphin look like George S. Patton. The pace might sag, and the world-view feels naive, but the energy never drops out. Two things keep driving The Last Samurai. One is Cruise's work ethic: In a strenuous role, he takes a pounding. The other is the filmmakers' moral indignation at the predatory greed that's at the heart of so much human misery. What will they make of this movie in 20 years? I'd love to know. Made at a time of global anxiety, The Last Samurai is all about America's fear of its own power.. Advisory: This film contains graphic violence and mild language. ",1
"THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS: Fantasy drama. Starring Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Astin. Directed by Peter Jackson. (PG-13. 179 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Still, a few sloggy spots aside, The Two Towers is an outstanding effort that maintains the integrity and purpose that distinguished The Fellowship of the Ring. What's more, the second installment has discrete virtues that distinguish it from its predecessor. Here, the parallels between J.R.R. Tolkien's epic and the world situation at the time of its creation are all the more apparent. The Two Towers is clearly the product of a mid-20th century mind-set, and yet realizing that doesn't date the story. It adds to the film's luster as an impassioned testament. Here, when someone speaks of Gondor as the last hope for free men on earth, the words are not really about England in the dark days of the Blitz, but they're about that, too -- just as the columns and columns of savage orcs, waiting to be sent into battle, can't help but evoke the spectacle of the Nazis at Nuremberg. The terror in The Two Towers is that magic will be used in the service of evil. Replace the word magic with science, and we see that the Fellowship shares the precise fear Winston Churchill eloquently expressed during World War II, a dark age, made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the lights of perverted science. That's why they fight. As The Two Towers begins, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his sweet-natured companion Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way to Mordor, where they hope, somehow, to destroy Frodo's all-powerful ring in Mordor's furnaces. Not far behind are the good-guy warriors, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), a human; Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), an irascible dwarf; and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an aristocratic-looking elf. And two other hobbits, Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan), have been captured by orcs. The forces of light are aided by the re-emergence of Gandalf the Gray, a wizard (Ian McKellen), who has recovered from his free fall in The Fellowship of the Ring to return with increased powers as Gandalf the White, resplendent in what appears to be one of Cher's cast-off white wigs. The Two Towers takes place within a geopolitical framework of horrific grimness. While the scattered Fellowship struggles to regroup, Saruman (Christopher Lee), the wicked white wizard, is galvanizing legions of barbarians to lay waste to civilization. He has raised an army of staggering numbers, who ride on boarlike creatures that are just as lethal as the soldiers. Saruman's first target is Rohan, a genteel culture further weakened by a failing old king (Bernard Hill). The battle is between good and evil -- isn't it always? -- and yet here we can feel it. While other films portray evil as some hysterical impulse to destroy, The Two Towers is informed by a real understanding of how evil tends to manifest in the real world. Destruction is a means to an end. Saruman's main goal is to crush spirits, obliterate free impulse and enslave everyone. In the past century that was tried on a mass scale at least twice, in Germany and behind the Iron Curtain. In the new century, we have our own challenges, only emphasized by the fact that the movie's title sounds so much like the Twin Towers that people keep calling it that by accident. The film may be fantasy, but we can recognize the stakes as our own, and eternal. In The Two Towers, evil is so great that nature itself cries out. Merry and Pippin find themselves in a forest in which trees speak and walk -- and ultimately the trees get up and leave the forest to fight Saruman. It's a magical and moving sight. Equally moving, in a sad way, is the sight of the elves gracefully leaving Middle-earth, taking their pointy ears and ageless selves away forever. To see it is like seeing a world no longer worthy of a benediction. It's rather a world for conflicted creatures such as Gollum, who emerges as a major figure in The Two Towers, guiding Frodo and Sam to Mordor, as he swings wildly from slavish devotion to thoughts of homicide. With his plasticity of expression, Gollum, who looks like a hairless cat, is the most extraordinary character ever realized through computer graphics. In fact, an actor, Andy Serkis, did the initial performance, and then his footage was computer enhanced. Like all stories that endure, the Lord of the Rings trilogy contains a certain ambiguity. It's suffused by a longing for leadership in the mythic sense; hence the appeal of Aragorn and Gandalf. Yet at their core, the books are more deeply invested in the notion that the least must do what the great cannot. It's to this viewpoint that The Two Towers ultimately tilts, with Frodo, the every-hobbit carrying the fate of the world, being himself carried by the humble Sam, whose honest, chubby face in the movie's final moments becomes a portrait of courage and developing wisdom. Think of The Two Towers as an allegory of the spirit. That's why its fantastical architecture and locations register not as tricks but as psychological interiors, the interiors of the spirit. Whether we're shown the vast wasted structures of subterranean cities, or the buttresses of an evil empire, the visual statement reinforces the real scope of the drama: The greatness and ruinousness of the human mind, and its choices. If you want to see The Two Towers but missed the first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring, here's some information from the first film to keep you from feeling lost: Hobbits are small, good-natured folk who love hearth and home. Dwarfs are somewhat taller and rougher. Humans are humans, and elves are tall, immortal beings. In the first film, Frodo, a hobbit, comes into possession of a gold ring that gives invincible, corrupting power to anyone who wears it. The ring is a force of evil, and the creator of that force, Sauron, wants it back. Using his minions, the orcs, and with the help of an evil wizard, Saruman, Sauron sets out to retrieve the ring, so he can destroy civilization. It becomes Frodo's dread mission to save the world by unmaking the ring, in the only place hot enough to dissolve it, the furnace where Sauron forged it. To that end, a fellowship is created, including among others an elf (Legolas), a man (Aragorn), a dwarf (Gimli) and a Gray Wizard (Gandalf). They, along with the hobbits Merry, Pippin and Sam, intend to accompany Frodo on his mission. But by the end of the previous film, their little band had dispersed . . . ",1
"THE MAN WHO CRIED: Drama. Starring Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett, Johnny Depp and John Turturro. Directed by Sally Potter. (R. 102 minutes. At the Embarcadero and Albany Twin.) We see this mess, in the opening scenes, through the eyes of a little Russian Jewish girl who is separated from her father and dislocated because of religious oppression. Later, as a grown woman, she is called Suzie and lives in Paris. It's the late 1930s and everyone knows that another world war is about to break out -- everyone except for people who won't admit it to themselves, which is almost everybody. As the adult Suzie, an immigrant who grew up in England, Christina Ricci adopts the tentative watchfulness of someone who had to learn a language and a culture through immersion. It's a studied performance, conscientious and professional, and yet somehow uninspired, as though Ricci, not Suzie, were the one worried about making a mistake. Much more interesting, and certainly bigger and more generous, is the performance of Cate Blanchett, here cast as Lola, a Russian dancer with bleached hair and a determination to marry money. Or just live with money -- she's not particular. As played by Blanchett, Lola is a study in warring extremes, flashy but diffident, smiling but miserable, sure of herself and unable to look Suzie in the eye. Suzie, by contrast, looks everyone in the eye. She never stops looking. For a good chunk in the middle, The Man Who Cried pursues parallel tracks. It tells the story of Lola's blossoming romance with an Italian opera singer, Dante (John Turturro), and of Suzie's interest in a brooding Gypsy, Cesar, played by Johnny Depp. Viewers may find themselves enjoying the Lola-Dante scenes and slapping themselves awake for the Suzie-Cesar scenes. The problem is not with Potter's story. The problem is with Ricci and Depp, who are boring. In scene after scene, it's just big eyes and the pretense of deep feeling under an impassive surface. A scene can absorb the energy suck of one actor like that. Two is deadening. Luckily, Blanchett and Turturro do enough acting for everybody, and what comes across is not hamminess but generosity, a willingness to go out on a limb. Turturro plays what is essentially the villain of the piece -- an unfaithful lover, an egotist, a Mussolini supporter. But he also shows the vulnerability -- Dante's struggles with his temper, his need to be liked and his terror of losing his career in the war. In the end, Potter's cinematic vision is what makes The Man Who Cried shimmer and levitate. Think of the movie as a chamber epic, or an epic chamber piece. It feels both big and little, concentrating as it does on the small movements in people's lives and the huge tides of history. The good thing is that Potter not only can do the two-person conversation, but she can also show multitudes fleeing Paris as the Nazis advance and, later, she can fill the Place de la Concorde with German soldiers and make it seem real. The weight Potter brings to those scenes has an impact beyond their moment. We always believe in the world outside. ",1
"THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS: Comedy. Starring Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller. Directed by Wes Anderson. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Instead, it's something rare -- a movie about people who have already fallen, whose best days are behind them. This is the third film by Wes Anderson, who started his career with the irritating and incoherent Bottle Rocket, then took a giant step with Rushmore, about a gifted 15-year-old. The Royal Tenenbaums represents another giant step. At times it's clumsy, but then smoothness is an overrated virtue, easiest to achieve when one has nothing new to say. In The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson explores a new tone, gives vent to a distinct sensibility and style of humor and finds completely offbeat ways of tugging at the emotions. In the process, he has made a film like no other, an epic, depressive comedy, with lots of ironic laughs and a humane and rather sad feeling at its core. A brief prologue -- narrated by Alec Baldwin -- introduces the Tenenbaum siblings as children. Oldest son Chas was a gifted international trader while in junior high school. Adopted sister Margot was a successful playwright in her early teens. Richie was a tennis pro from the minute he picked up a racket. But then the father, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), left the mother, Etheline (Anjelica Huston), and the family's magic began to wane. The movie picks up the gifted Tenenbaum children in later life, in different stages of falling-apart adulthood. Oddly, their various unhappinesses bear no relationship to their early gifts. They have just short- circuited, in the sad way of people everywhere. The movie has a light-fingered quirkiness that's original and engaging. Chas, trapped in a state of furious shell shock and fear after his wife dies in a plane crash, torments his sons with middle-of-the-night evacuation drills. Like most of the comic bits, the spectacle is infused with recognition of life's unavoidable tragedies. Anderson is a practitioner of true irony, the worldly variety that existed before it was transformed by overuse into reflexive carping and idiot cynicism. In Royal Tenenbaum, Gene Hackman finds one of his classic roles, one calling for that combination of geniality and menace that's the actor's hallmark. As Royal, he's a charismatic delight, with a dapper lack of sensitivity and an unerring instinct for inflicting offhand damage on his children. He just has something missing in his wiring -- he consoles his grandchildren over their mother's death by saying, I'm very sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman. That Hackman succeeds in making this the essence of Royal's charm is really rather brilliant. For various reasons, all the children come home, and soon, too, does Royal, claiming to be dying and wanting to make amends. In fact, he's just looking for a place to live, and yet there's a larger truth at work. In his occluded way, he has a sense that the clock is ticking, that this is his chance to make things right. It's just in his nature that he can do it only under cover of a scam. The picture unfolds its rambling story in a dreamlike, bygone New York, a city that was a center of real culture, not just pop culture. Throughout, there are visions of lost gentility -- not just in the prewar rooftops but in the townhouse closet, stuffed to the gills with worn board games from 30 years ago. ",1
"THE SCORPION KING: Action adventure. Starring the Rock, Kelly Hu, Steven Brand and Grant Heslov. Directed by Chuck Russell. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) At the center of every frame, if only because of his size, is the Rock, a professional wrestler who is the most incongruous-looking leading man since Arnold Schwarzenegger. Look at him quickly, and you might wonder why the movie keeps photographing him standing behind furniture -- only to realize that no, that isn't a sofa; that's his arm. The Rock is big and beefy and onscreen he is mainly about his undeniable physical presence. Yet if the Rock looks mean in still photos, he seems like a reasonable fellow the moment he starts talking. On the few occasions in The Scorpion King when he has to speak more than two sentences in a row, he sounds as helpful and ingratiating as an insurance agent. This disconnect between the way the Rock looks and sounds will either make him or break him as a film star. I think it will make him. In fact, that divergence between the Rock's presence and his essence helps to broaden and define the range of The Scorpion King, allowing it to be serious and a trifle silly, too. The picture, set at the dawn of history, has the wit to wink at a modern sensibility. Thus we get absurdist moments like the one in which the Scorpion King's sidekick, Arpid (Grant Heslov), reacts with horror at hearing their next destination: The Valley of the Dead! Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead! That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead! In this world of 5,000 years ago, civilization is composed of various tribes, but as the movie starts, one leader, the power-hungry Memnon (Steven Brand), is in the process of conquering all the tribes and placing them under his tyranny. He is a proto-Hitler, embracing genocide. In case we have any doubt of his evil, the movie has him speak with an English accent and say effete lines that only a bad guy would utter, such as How distressing. Pray tell. Memnon's secret weapon in his quest for power is his sorceress (Kelly Hu), who sees into the future and knows when he should attack his enemies. The sorceress is gorgeous, but Memnon will not go to bed with her because he believes that once she isn't a virgin she will lose her clairvoyance. That in itself shows his warped sense of priorities. The Rock plays Mathayus, the last member of a tribe that apparently took its motto Live free, die well a bit too literally. In the movie's first minutes, Mathayus is commissioned to assassinate the sorceress, and from there The Scorpion King becomes a series of adventures, containing some genuinely stirring action scenes, including one in which Mathayus attacks an army single- handedly. Director Chuck Russell and his screenwriters stay true to the time period and don't rely on special effects. They hold the audience with imagination and a playful spirit. A visit to Gomorrah is all we might hope for, with a brothel right in the middle of a street market. At times, the crowd scenes look, from a distance, like the audience at a heavy-metal concert, but everything ridiculous about the picture seems intentional and tongue in cheek. Kelly Hu has the look a movie star, and the Rock, with his easy screen aura, is a comfortable person to root for. He's no Hulk Hogan. At one point, told that it's his destiny to be killed by Memnon, Mathayus replies, I make my own destiny. The Rock says the line with an assurance that's surprising -- until one catches on that the conviction behind it has nothing to do with the movie but is that of a wrestler who has climbed his way into a starring role in a big-budget Hollywood movie.

"THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING: Drama. Starring Alan Arkin, Matthew McConaughey and John Turturro. Directed by Jill Sprecher. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What's exciting is that the Sprechers have delved into territory that is normally the domain of literature and have emerged with a film that's neither overly literary nor simplistic. Thirteen Conversations makes a case for cinema as a vehicle for conveying moods and ideas and, hardest of all, the internal movements of a soul. If that doesn't sound like much, just imagine trying to capture the movements of a soul on camera. Where does one begin? In Thirteen Conversations, Sprecher doesn't just do that once. She does it repeatedly, in a film with an ensemble cast and a screenplay made up of interconnected and interweaving stories. It's the kind of picture that's often called small, but, in fact, its ambition is enormous, even grandiose and foolhardy. On a single canvas, the Sprechers are trying to represent the spiritual state of contemporary urban life. Most of the film's characters are suffering from a form of depression, not the can't-get-out-of-bed kind, but the insidious kind that's like a low-grade fever. John Turturro plays a physics professor in a burnt-out marriage. When he comes home to dinner with his wife (Amy Irving), the feeling in the air is not one of recrimination but of utter exhaustion. It's so quiet in that apartment they can hear themselves age. The conversations are all about happiness, how to get it, how to keep it, how to lose it. Matthew McConaughey is a hotshot young lawyer who meets a sour insurance executive (Alan Arkin) in a bar. The lawyer believes he can make his own luck. The insurance man is fatalistic, seeing life as a kind of rigged game. Subsequent events prove both of them wrong. If any one actor is at the center of the film it's Arkin, who plays a bitter claims adjuster, Gene, who develops a hostile fixation for one of his employees, Wade (William Wise), a fellow with a kind in-born gift for happiness. Gene needs to convince himself that Wade is an idiot. It's either that or admit that he has misspent his own life. Jill Sprecher is not a cuddly filmmaker. The emotions in Thirteen Conversations are muted and low-key. Yet underneath the pristine surface is a well of tender feeling. The humanity is unmistakable in the story of Beatrice (Clea DuVall), a cheerful maid whose faith in the goodness of people and the meaning of life is shattered by a seemingly trivial incident. Thirteen Conversations has a complicated structure, with some incidents presented out of sequential order. The time-juggling lends the film an edge of mystery, which is appropriate, though it's also good that the puzzle is tied up neatly by the finish. Not every scene works. Not every incident or conversation is of equal interest or has a strong pay-off. So what? Sometimes Bergman was boring, too, even in his best films. That's the risk a filmmaker takes when she decides to make a subtle movie. That's the risk the audience takes, as well. But 10 or 12 weak minutes scattered over the course of a film of this quality is a small price to pay. The Sprechers are onto something. Four years ago, when their first film, Clockwatchers, was released, some people misunderstood and considered it a flat attempt at an office satire. But these women are not about satire. They're about showing the real pain of real people. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing is their artistic breakthrough. ",1
"TOM CRUISE as Cage in Warner Bros. Pictures' and Village Roadshow Pictures' sci-fi thriller EDGE OF TOMORROW, distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.TOM CRUISE as Cage in Warner Bros. Pictures' and Village Roadshow Pictures' sci-fi thriller EDGE OF TOMORROW, distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and in select territories by Village Roadshow Action. Starring Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. Directed by Doug Liman. (PG-13. 113 minutes.) The Earth is being invaded by space aliens, and only Tom Cruise stands between us and complete annihilation. Yes, we've been there before, but Edge of Tomorrow covers familiar ground with unexpected wit and economy, and the result is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi fantasy. The film is based on the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill, in which a young recruit dies in his first battle, but because of some twist in the system, he keeps coming back to relive his last 24 hours, increasing his survival skills with each return. Adapting the story for Cruise, the screenwriters devise a more compelling situation - and one with a touch of comedy: Cruise plays a spokesman for the military's public relations department, a middle-aged major with no combat experience who is forced to hit the beaches as part of a landing force.  As the film starts, the aliens occupy most of Europe, and an implacable Irish general (Brendan Gleeson) is planning a make-or-break D-Day type invasion for the following day. Cruise, as the confident, telegenic major, is talking breezily, and on seemingly equal terms with the general, when he finds out that he is being embedded with the first wave of troops. It's the kind of comic scene made for Cruise. Struggling to stay on his game, he tries charming the general, making jokes, flashing his big smile - while the general looks at him as if he's a worm. As a last resort, he tries threats and ends up demoted to private and put on the front line.  Director Doug Liman lavishes time on these early scenes, and they're crucial in the way they ground the movie in its world and establish a bond between audience and protagonist. The major starts off as the viewer's surrogate, an entirely sympathetic spectator to horror. We're with him for the beach landing, which isn't by boat but by airplane, with the soldiers jumping out of the bottom, wearing armor and suspended by cords. It's the familiar terror and chaos, augmented by futuristic technology. By getting killed and coming back, over and over, the major soon grasps two things: First, the aliens wanted the invasion and had an ambush ready, and second, his ability to come back, again and again, might be the only edge humanity has in this war. This leads to a collaboration with the heroine of the special forces, played by a tough and grim Emily Blunt. Though the time is constantly resetting, Edge of Tomorrow consistently has a feeling of forward motion, even momentum, and the filmmakers always keep things clear so that viewers always know exactly where they are in the story. In a way, the film schools us in how to watch it, so that, at our most advanced, we can catch on as to whether a scene is of the characters doing something for the first time, or the 20th. The gimmicks of repetition and time travel make for comic opportunities, which the movie exploits without losing the serious thread. Likewise, as the major grows in knowledge and becomes someone who knows about the fates of others, there are poignant moments as well. All these are harmonized nicely into one flow and one vision by the director.  Though Liman is best known for action movies (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Bourne Identity), he started his career with edgy comedies, such as Swingers and Go. You can see some of that acerbic comic touch in the performances of Bill Paxton, whose Master Sergeant has a hint of surreal mania, and Gleeson, whose deadpan as the commanding general is equally funny and alarming. We come to see them as the major sees them, as exaggerated figures, stuck in the illusion of time. Cruise is a delight, exactly what he needs to be, fluid enough for comedy, physical enough for action, always going with the flow and yet finding ways to make moments memorable. Like Clark Gable a few generations ago, Cruise has maintained his stardom for three decades now, rarely ever making a great movie, but rarely making a bomb. At a certain point, all these pretty good, good and very good movies can't be a coincidence. ",1
"TOSCA: Dramatic opera. Starring Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. Directed by Benoit Jacquot. (Not rated. 119 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) So this Tosca will not go down as one of the great opera movies, on the order of, say, Franco Zeffirelli's La Traviata. Yet it's still something to savor because of the splendor of the opera itself and because the film stars a pair of singing superstars, soprano Angela Gheorghiu and tenor Roberto Alagna, who look great, look their parts and are in beautiful voice. Opera lovers should be excited. To the extent aficionados ever get to see opera on film at all, they usually have to cope with static videos of stage productions. Tosca is much better than that. In fact, opera novices should be excited, too. After all, Tosca is one of the most accessible of operas, fairly short (just under two hours) and with music that's appealing on first hearing. The film just might turn on many people to opera, in general, an art form at once visceral and spiritual, wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life. It says something about the quality of the singers and the indestructibility of Tosca that the film thrives, even though director Jacquot's main conceptual contribution to the movie is idiotic. Jacquot blends color footage of the actors performing the story with occasional switches to black-and-white handheld footage of the singers and musicians recording the soundtrack. Whenever a new character's name is mentioned, the director cuts to shots of the singer, in street clothes, standing by a microphone. This approach does nothing but distance the audience from the action, as though neo- Brechtian contrivances have any place in a Puccini universe. Indeed, Jacquot does two things that can be filed under the category of crimes against Tosca: He has Alagna speak, not sing, his Act 1 duet with Gheorghiu. (Why?) And in the interlude between Act 2 and Act 3, he breaks the mood by taking us back into the recording studio for an extended period, during which we get to see maestro Antonio Pappano conducting and chewing gum. We also get to examine, in a painfully tight close-up, the dental work of a boy soprano. But a long close-up of braces is, in the end, a small price to pay for looking at Alagna and Gheorghiu, a handsome couple (who are married in real life). Alagna plays Mario, a painter and freedom fighter who hides an escaped political prisoner. His lover, Tosca (Gheorghiu), is an operatic diva. Evil intrudes in the form of Baron Scarpia (Ruggero Raimondi), who imprisons Mario and contrives to manipulate Tosca for two purposes -- to find the prisoner and to coerce her into his own bed. The Act 2 showdown between Scarpia and Tosca is the centerpiece of Tosca. Raimondi makes a tense, introverted, sneering villain, not the exuberant sadist that we sometimes see. Gheorghiu brings dark beauty and fire to her role, though her vocal talent is considerably greater than her acting ability, and at times it seems she's playing Tosca as a bit of a dunce. Then again, Gheorghiu's performance has the misfortune of being haunted by a ghost, namely that of Maria Callas, whose filmed performances as Tosca are unforgettable and unsurpassable. Actually, the movie itself is a haunted by a ghost -- the Tosca, with Callas, that Zeffirelli was all set to film in the mid-1960s, before the deal collapsed. There's no perfection like the perfection of a movie we can only imagine in our minds. With that kind of competition, this Tosca can only come in a distant second, but one thing is certain -- Alagna's Mario is exceptionally strong. His Act 1 and Act 3 arias are goosebumps-inducing highlights, and throughout the film his acting is first rate. Particularly interesting is what he does in the last scene, in which Mario gets good news from Tosca. Ever so subtly, Alagna lets us know that Mario doesn't believe it, a choice that adds another whole dimension to the third act. ",1
"Take “The Judge” on its own terms, as a touching exploration of a father-son relationship, and you may be disappointed. Honest in some ways, it also has just enough schmaltz to make viewers pull back precisely when they’re supposed to surrender fully. Sometimes sentimental is simply another word for predictable. “The Judge,” despite many virtues, follows a pattern.Better to think of it this way, as a collision between Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. — or rather their personas — thrown together in a scenario in which they must pretend to be father and son. In one corner, we have the irresistible force that is Downey, the mile-a-minute speech, the glib facade barely concealing a vulnerable core. And in the other, we have Duvall, the father no one wants, at least no son, an implacable and belligerent know-it-all who has the unforgivable habit of often being right.Can they be themselves on screen, those selves we’ve come to know in detail, and yet seem like members of the same family? The answer is yes, at least once you remember that baldness is inherited from the mother’s side. In fact, this is a very good film for both of them, a rich and rare showcase for Duvall, 83, and an opportunity for Downey to remind people that he’s really an actor, and not just a blockbuster fixture.It must be lots of fun writing dialogue for Downey: “Everybody wants Atticus Finch until there’s a dead hooker in a hot tub.” He plays Hank, a top lawyer who has come a long way from his Indiana childhood, and he may have come some distance from himself as well. He’s a workaholic, specializing in keeping white-collar criminals out of jail, and he has a trophy wife who is dumping him for one reason or another. Maybe he wasn’t nice to her. Or maybe he picked the wrong person.His mother’s death brings him to Indiana for the funeral, which means reuniting with his father, whom he doesn’t call “Dad,” or “Pops,” but “Judge.” That says it all. Then just when he is about to leave, the Judge is arrested for running a guy over with his car, and Hank decides to stay and try to keep his father out of prison.Much of the story concerns the preparation for the case, but that’s really just the framework for the movie’s real area of interest, which is the family. Director David Dobkin might not be the subtlest of directors — he actually has the entire courtroom gasp at one point — but he and his fellow screenwriters avoid the obvious trap of making moral judgments. Hank isn’t really in need of reform, and the Judge isn’t a complete self-righteous blowhard. Somehow, “The Judge” gets into a rhythm in which it’s perfectly acceptable for scenes to linger. The 141-minute running time feels right.Vera Farmiga makes a strong impression in the modest role of the girl Hank left behind, now all grown up and working at the diner. The moment she appears, it’s like a neon sign flashing, “Move back to Indiana.” Vincent D’Onofrio and Jeremy Strong also lend good support as Hank’s older and younger brother, respectively, each troubled in his own way.But the best thing about “The Judge” is watching Downey and Duvall, as actors, playing off each other. They listen and react and take lines and moments to places that surprise us and seem to surprise them. It’s especially good to see Downey so unguarded, lashing out, letting the emotion rise without comment. Beethoven once went five years without composing. Until now, Downey has gone five years without making anything close to a serious movie. The bigger waste of time was Beethoven’s, but talent wasted is talent wasted. This is the type of film Downey should be making.",1
"Taken: Action thriller. Starring Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace and Olivier Rabourdin. Directed by Pierre Morel. (PG-13. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) So many movies are well intended but poorly made that when something like Taken comes along, it's a relief, almost a joy. There's nothing lofty in the intentions of Taken. The aspiration here was to make a simple, straight-ahead action thriller. Period. But if you think that's easy, think of all the lousy action thrillers that come out in the course of a year. The level of skill that went into Taken is masterly. This is a picture that will appeal mainly to people who love movies, and I use the word love advisedly. Viewers who love movies for their true soul - for their obviousness, for their manipulations, for their corniness, for their blend of high and low emotion - will take great pleasure in Taken. Others, who like movies conditionally, like a wayward lover they hope to reform, may end up hating Taken - or at least thinking of it as something stupid, ridiculous, far-fetched and worthless. Which reminds me of a story: When I was 6, all the kids I knew used to watch the TV show Batman. We took it very, very seriously. Then, at around 7, we realized it was ridiculous. Then, when we were around 9, we realized it was intended to be ridiculous, and we liked it again. At 7, we thought we were quite sophisticated, but, it turned out, there were higher levels of appreciation. Taken requires that higher level of appreciation. In terms of pace and economy, it's beautiful to behold. Director Pierre Morel, working from a script by Robert Mark Kamen (The Fifth Element) and Luc Besson, knows when to slow down and lavish time on characters to establish the emotions and motivations that are going to give the action its urgent undercurrent. Liam Neeson plays Brian, a nice, easygoing fellow whose main mission in life, as the film starts, is to rekindle a relationship with his teenage daughter. Apparently, he was a workaholic who neglected his family and wrecked his marriage, but he's determined to keep that one flickering connection alive and thriving. Oh, yes, and it turns out that he's a former CIA agent. Of course he is. What did you think, that this movie was going to be some boring thing about a family? Wake up and smell the explosions! So what happens next? How do the screenwriters connect the dedicated-father angle with the former CIA-agent angle? Three guesses. ... What, you only needed one guess? That's right, the daughter is taken and borne away by an international cabal of criminals. Anyone could devise this premise. The real measure of Taken is not in what happens but in how it happens. Observe, for example, the intelligent construction of the abduction scene. Notice how the design of the apartment (from which the girl is taken) and the use of the victim's perspective contribute to the tension. Take note of the sheer cleverness of the filmmakers' choosing to have it all happen while the girl is on the phone, and how that phone conversation builds the sense of dread and excitement.  It's as if the filmmakers, at every turn of the script, said, OK, this is how it's usually done. Let's come up with a way that's better. Then let's throw that out and come up with something that's even better than that. There are different kinds of creativity. Taken evinces the creativity of expert craftsmanship. Neeson is well cast as a softhearted, thoughtful, self-effacing man who is big enough to do serious damage once he gets angry. He's angry for most of the movie, which, incidentally, takes place mainly in Paris. The placement of an archetypal American character, the avenging action hero, wreaking havoc through the Paris streets has some dark appeal: No one at the tourist information booth is going to be rude to this guy.

"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby: Comedy. Starring Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly and Sacha Baron Cohen. Directed by Adam McKay. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The title character is a moron, played by Will Ferrell, an actor too good at playing morons not to be highly perceptive and intelligent. Within 10 minutes of screen time, Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) ascends to the top of the NASCAR world, mainly because he's a heedless character who drives like a maniac. It's a nice change of pace: Instead of being about the ascent of an underdog, the movie takes another tack, telling the tale of an obnoxious clod trying to stay on top. Cliches are avoided, and there are a few surprises. Stop laughing long enough to think, What are these guys trying to say? and you'll realize that Ferrell and director Andy McKay, who collaborated on the screenplay, are going out on a limb here. Take the scene in which the family gathers around the table for dinner. The table consists entirely of junk from fast-food restaurants. Ricky says grace, in a way that indicates a sentimental and bizarre take on religion, and gives thanks for the millions he's made, with no embarrassment or indication of any impulse for charity. The aggression and heartlessness extend even to the children, who abuse their grandfather with their parents' approval. Then Ricky lets out with some of his personal philosophy, a little social Darwinism by way of Vince Lombardi, which arouses his trophy wife (Leslie Bibb), who throws herself at him in a fit of lust. Sure, it's funny, but it's not only funny. It's funny for a reason. This is the blue-state dweller's exaggerated nightmare of the country's heartland: Bad taste, greed and cruelty hiding under the cloak of fake religion. The movie makes a feint in the direction of balance, by introducing a character who's a red-state nightmare of blue-state culture. Sacha Baron Cohen (TV's Ali G) plays a rival NASCAR driver who arrives on the scene, determined to defeat Ricky Bobby. Jean Girard is worse than a blue stater. He's French. Not only is he French, he's gay. And he's so cool that he drinks espresso as he races and can drive while reading Camus. It's a curious thing to see how the movie squares its sympathy for the values Girard represents, while maintaining Ricky as the protagonist, with all the plot obligations that that entails. That's the real juggling act, and the movie accomplishes it, without compromising the filmmakers' clear sympathies or taking the movie in a more caustic direction. Talladega Nights may be light entertainment, but the skill is apparent on a number of fronts. What is it about Ferrell that makes him so good at playing people in the grip of a delusion? Possibly, it's the way he combines absolute stupidity with absolute conviction -- alas, a common combination in this world -- and holds it up to ridicule. The screenplay comes up with ample opportunities for Ferrell to act deluded. The funniest one is that Ricky, following a car accident, becomes convinced he's on fire every time he gets behind a wheel. This allows for the absurd physical comedy of Ferrell, rolling around on the grass, running in circles and stripping down to his underwear, attempting to put out flames that aren't there. Not every bit is on that exalted level, and the picture gets a bit long near the finish. But comedies live and die on the basis of their laugh quotient, and Talladega Nights gets its share. -- Advisory: This film contains crude and sexual humor. ",1
"Thank You for Smoking: Satire. Starring Aaron Eckhart, William H. Macy, Katie Holmes and Robert Duvall. Directed by Jason Reitman. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, it's about a man who doesn't care about right or wrong, and it was written and directed by a filmmaker, Jason Reitman, who at least wasn't sure enough on the morality to make a commitment in this, his first feature. Thus, the wit is pointed, while the targets are all over the map: The media is corrupt, politicians are ridiculous, the public is easily manipulated, and everything is a mess. Thank You for Smoking doesn't exactly represent our era. Rather it is, in itself, an embodiment of it, a litany of complaints followed by a shrug of the shoulders, a movie about the morass that can't see through the morass. This lack of vision limits the film. After all, seeing through the morass is precisely what great satire does -- it takes a position above the current situation, sees past it, understands it and gives a warning. Network, MASH, A Face in the Crowd and The Manchurian Candidate all belong in that exalted category, whereas Thank You for Smoking is more along the order of spoof, a send-up of identifiable types that is meant to amuse all and offend none. If it has any intended social purpose at all, it's in the way it shows how spin masters tailor their pitches to the weaknesses of the TV medium, using rhetorical techniques to create the illusion that their specious points have validity. In an early scene, Nick (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist and spokesman for the tobacco industry, appears on a talk show with anti-smoking crusaders, before a hostile audience. By appearing genial, feigning concern and twisting the arguments of his opponents, he is able to win the audience over in a matter of minutes. Nick has the gift of ... well, the Irish call it blarney. Americans call it something you can't print in the newspaper. Whatever you call it, he has that knack in a big way, so it's no surprise that his skills should be employed where they're most desperately needed. Anyone could argue a true position, but it takes talent for a tobacco industry spokesman to make people believe he wants a reduction in teen smoking. Nick has two friends who meet with him for lunch every week: an alcohol industry spokeswoman (Maria Bello) and a gun industry spokesman (David Koechner). They call themselves the MOD Squad, short for merchants of death. But Nick is the most talented of the three, which is appropriate, as his industry kills the most people. With his easy charm and good looks, and that hint of awareness under the polished facade, Eckhart is ideally cast as Nick, who has to fend off assaults and challenges from a disillusioned ex-wife (Kim Dickens), a shrewd journalist (Katie Holmes) and a crusading anti-smoking politician (William H. Macy). As the do-gooder politician, Macy plays the role entirely straight and ends up delivering a performance that's richer and funnier than he would have had he given in to exaggeration. For all the film's sharpness, it hits a couple of lulls in the middle. It has plenty of things to poke fun at, but little, really, to say, and the protagonist remains a superficial man. (If he were less superficial, he'd be diabolical.) On two occasions, he tells someone that he does what he does in order to pay the mortgage. The second time, it begins to seem as if the writer-director sympathizes. If anything, the movie's ultimate assertion that individual responsibility is to be preferred over government intervention, while something most people could agree with, tends to lend legitimacy to Nick's life of lying for profit. Yet at the heart of Thank You for Smoking is a belief in the importance of one thing: success. Nick's talent is real, and in the construct of this film, it would be a terrible thing if he did not get a chance to practice his gift and enjoy its rewards. That's an amazing way to see Nick, a point of view that's cynical in the extreme without the filmmaker seeming to notice. Obviously, just a little beneath the surface of this supposedly biting satire, there are attitudes and assumptions in serious need of satirical treatment. -- Advisory: Strong language and simulated sex.

"The 2012 film “Jack Reacher” didn’t seem like the beginning of anything, but more like a mediocre one-off, something that Tom Cruise was trying out that didn’t quite succeed. But the sequel, “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,” is of a whole other order. This is a superior and assured action movie, a quality product that makes the case for a franchise.There are certainly lots of stories to choose from. The movie is based on “Never Go Back,” Lee Child’s 18th novel featuring Reacher, a huge and relentless ex-military officer, now living the life of a drifter. Cruise can’t exactly make himself huge, but it’s amazing what Cruise can do just by thinking huge, and relentlessness for him is second nature. And this time, there is a quality team behind the camera. Edward Zwick (“Glory”) directed, and he also co-wrote the script, in collaboration with Richard Wenk (“The Equalizer”) and Marshall Herskovitz (“Love and Other Drugs,” “The Last Samurai”). “Never Go Back” gets off to a great start. A local sheriff is about to lead Reacher away in handcuffs, but Reacher is typically unfazed. “In 90 seconds, two things are going to happen,” he says. He predicts that the pay phone on the wall will soon ring and that the sheriff himself will be led away in handcuffs. What follows is a highly entertaining 90 seconds.The film tops this flashy opening with an assured and speedy plunge into story. Reacher heads back to his old military headquarters to meet a major (Cobie Smulders, “How I Met Your Mother”) whom he has become interested in. They have developed a flirtatious relationship over the phone. But when he arrives in town, he finds that the major is in a military prison, charged with espionage.Movies like this — action thrillers, involving nations and governments — are elaborate constructions. Their scale and mechanical nature will not appeal to everyone, but those who appreciate them will enjoy the workings of the machinery here. “Never Go Back” presents Reacher with a monumental problem. He’s operating only on a hunch that a woman he barely knows is innocent. He is in a maze, without a clue as to what is happening or why. And he soon finds that everyone is against him — local law enforcement, teams of paid assassins and, of course, the entire United States government.Thrown into the mix, and bordering on overkill, Reacher also has to protect a teenage girl who might very well be his own daughter. Samantha (Danika Yarosh) is loud and feral, seemingly raised by wolves, and she definitely wins the prize for Most Annoying Action Movie Daughter Since Maggie Grace in “Taken.”Fortunately, the pairing of Cruise and Smulders is a good one. In a way that’s both satisfying and compelling, they seem evenly matched. Smulders is utterly believable as a career military woman, tough and no-nonsense, with the bearing of someone who has had to muscle her way through a male-run organization. As an actress and as a character, Smulders looks at Cruise as an equal; she doesn’t act like a guest star in a Cruise universe. This is a balance that Zwick enforces, to the movie’s benefit.Such are the advantages of getting a quality director to work in the action genre. If characters are running from bad guys, it really does help to know who those characters are, to have a sense of their interaction, and to worry about their safety. All good movies are about people, even good action movies. As for Cruise, the Reacher character is a challenge. Reacher never smiles, so right off that’s one weapon in the Cruise arsenal taken off the table. He doesn’t talk much, so Cruise’s verbal dexterity doesn’t come into play, either. Reacher is also something of a pessimist, which means Cruise must contain his natural ebullience. The only point of intersection between Cruise and Reacher is sheer will. And — at the risk of sounding like a bad Shakespeare sonnet — the question is this: Does Cruise have enough will to play will and succeed through force of will alone?The answer is yes. With Tom Cruise, the answer is always yes.",1
"The Assassination of Richard Nixon: Drama. Starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. Directed by Niels Mueller. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Sean Penn plays Sam Bicke, who sells office furniture for a living, just the latest in a succession of jobs. Sam's wife, Marie (Naomi Watts), has thrown him out, but he thinks someday soon they'll get back together. That's what he thinks, but her body language and the careful, gentle tone she adopts around him make it plain: That door is closed forever. And that's just one door. Throughout the film, they all close on Sam, while he stands there in his cheap sport jacket, too stunned to wipe the smile off his face. Penn is superb, practically radioactive with failure and flashing loser with every hopeful look and unsteady gaze. Sam is a man in his 40s whose life is just not adding up. Is it his fault? Is it America's fault? Say yes to either question, and The Assassination of Richard Nixon becomes trite. The real answer is more complicated, a neither and both situation of a fellow finding himself, through little fault of his own, adrift in a culture to which he's unsuited. He's not better than the culture, or worse. He just doesn't belong. As a furniture salesman, he's mentored by a gruff and bullying manager (Australian actor Jack Thompson), who advises him to study Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People and Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking. The early 1970s were the heyday of such guides -- another was Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich -- that instructed readers how to alter their thinking and behavior in the pursuit of happiness and success. As translated into a sales environment, Sam is expected to exude confidence as a way of bending customers to his will. He's supposed to banish doubt while pursuing an uncertain outcome, which means that when he fails, it's his own fault. At the same time that Sam is trying to mold himself into a capitalist dynamo, he becomes enamored of a whole other set of American myths. He becomes attracted to leftist political radicalism as a way of justifying and ennobling his own sense of helplessness. In this scheme, his failures are not his fault. He's just the victim of a conspiracy by rich and powerful interests to keep him in the gutter. In a deadpan absurd scene, Sam goes to the local Black Panther office and suggests that they change their name to the Zebras so that white people could join, too. In essence, what we have in Sam Bicke is a sophisticated portrait of ideological confusion. Sam is desperately looking for a thought system whereby he can identify and understand his own alienation. Sam understands nothing but his own misery, and it never occurs to him that his predicament is a result of random circumstances. The assumption he makes, which he never questions, is that his condition is emblematic. He's sure he's supposed to make sense of things, and when he can't, his reason coagulates around a fantastic plot to kill the president. Though the movie sometimes drags a little, the protagonist's dilemma is rendered in compelling human terms. The scene in which Bicke applies for a loan and unwittingly reveals his neurosis to a loan officer is excruciating in the best way. So are Sam's follow-up visits to the bank. Few actors are this good at getting tortured -- this is Penn at his best. The period details are rich, from the oversize (pre-energy crisis) cars to a sign on the wall of a mechanic's shop -- $12 is the hourly rate for labor. As a waitress in a restaurant, Bicke's wife has to wear something that looks like a tutu, a degrading outfit by 2005 standards, and just as degrading, but par for the course, in 1974. -- Advisory: This film contains violence, strong language and sexual situations.

"The Aviator: Drama. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, John C. Reilly and Alec Baldwin. Directed by Martin Scorsese. (PG-13. 169 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The only thing missing is a good answer to this question: Excuse me, Mr. Scorsese, but why did you make a movie about Howard Hughes? If there's an answer, besides, He's interesting or I thought it would be cool, it's not on the screen. Scorsese's Raging Bull was a masterpiece because it was a lot more than the life of an obnoxious boxer. Kinsey, inferior to The Aviator in almost every way, nonetheless contained specific reasons for depicting that life, which helped. In comparison, The Aviator has a hole in its center, and Scorsese fills it the only way he can, with spectacle. He makes The Aviator colorful and entertaining from beginning to end. There are worse things. Hughes' life provides plenty of opportunities for dramatic depiction. He produced and directed movies, ran a studio, set flying records and designed and built airplanes. Then he gave way to mental illness and lived his remaining years as a recluse. The Aviator focuses on his years of ambition, innovation and accomplishment. We first meet him on the set of his film Hell's Angels, the World War I flying epic that took him years to make. At first glance, Leonardo DiCaprio looks a little young to be playing Hughes, but in fact he's on the mature side. Hughes started directing that film when he was 21. This is where a little previous interest or knowledge helps. Coming in cold, it might be amusing to watch Hughes, a young novice, lavishing time and money on this risky venture. But if you've ever watched Hell's Angels and the brilliant aerial sequences he created -- easily some of the best ever filmed -- it's fascinating to see how he did it. For one thing, The Aviator tells us, he needed clouds. He observed that planes shot against a clear sky looked as though they were standing still, even when they were moving quickly. They needed to be shot against clouds, so as to convey their speed. The film smoothly navigates from one episode to the next in Hughes' life, with two things remaining constant: his love of airplanes, and the specter of mental illness. In a plane, he's fearless, but he's terrified of germs, and eventually his phobia makes him a voluntary prisoner. We see it coming, but more poignantly, he sees it coming. In one of the film's best scenes, he confesses his fears to his girlfriend, who just happens to be movie star Katharine Hepburn. Cate Blanchett plays Hepburn, sauntering into the film as though she owns it, as though this were The Katharine Hepburn Story, which is exactly what Hepburn would do. When she does, the film bursts into life. Blanchett adopts an audacious strategy for the role in that she flat-out imitates Hepburn, and the first reaction is to laugh. But Blanchett also gets Hepburn, and so we gradually come to accept her performance for the same reasons we accepted all those Hepburn performances: because we give up under the relentless pounding and because we recognize the sensitive and noble spirit behind the relentlessness. As Hughes, DiCaprio is nimble and appealing. If one wanted to concentrate long enough to find fault, one could say that he's not quite believable as a man who's going crazy, but whatever he does, he makes us care that Hughes is going crazy, and that's good enough. He also conveys, in subtle ways, the differences in aura, energy and motion between a man at 21 and 40. He's supported well by John C. Reilly, as Hughes' top accountant (and professional worrier), and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the head of Pan Am and the chief competitor of Hughes' TWA. Especially enjoyable are the two scenes between DiCaprio and Alan Alda, who plays a corrupt senator. Kate Beckinsale doesn't get to do all that much as Ava Gardner, but she does what she's called upon to do, which is to convince us that Ava was one of the great broads of all time - - tough, aware of her worth, but also decent, a loyal friend. As Jean Harlow, who accompanies Hughes to the Hell's Angels premiere, Gwen Stefani has about three lines. She doesn't look or sound like Harlow, but then any actress with Harlow's charm would have had to be given a bigger part. The audience would expect it. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, strong language and a plane-crash sequence. ",1
"The Barbarian Invasions: Drama. Starring Remy Girard, Stephane Rousseau and Marie-Josee Croze. Directed by Denys Arcand. (Rated R. 100 95 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The treatment of the subject isn't maudlin, thanks to a witty script and an enormously likable lead character, Remy (Remy Girard), who remains bullheaded and lusty to the finish. The movie is also safe viewing for hypochondriacs, because it's not symptom oriented -- Remy is already in bad shape at the start. The performances cut deep, and there are scenes of powerful and completely earned emotion that rival anything on the screen this year. The only flaw, and it's not a grave one, is that for all its honesty, the movie becomes squeamish, presenting death as antiseptic. At center stage is the relationship between Remy and his son, Sebastien (Stephane Rousseau), his temperamental opposite. Remy is a rumpled leftist chatterbox and a serial womanizer whose personal life is a mess, while Sebastien is self-assured, reserved and responsible, an impeccably dressed investment banker living in London. Father and son have the usual bad blood and not much common ground, but when Sebastien arrives in Montreal, he finds himself the only person in the position to help his father get the best care. So he stays. Arcand tweaks the political right and left throughout Barbarian, but if his goal is to terrify Americans away from considering the Canadian single- payer health care system, he couldn't do a better job. In one scene he tracks all the way down a hospital corridor, lined on both sides with patients in hospital beds. It's like a Third World death factory, and in order to get Remy an important test, Sebastien has to take him over the border into Vermont. I voted for Medicare and have to accept the consequences, Remy says. Instead he accepts a private room, which Sebastien obtains by bribing the unions and hospital administration. The film takes its title from remarks by a French Canadian intellectual who refers to the Sept. 11, 2001, attack as the possible beginning of the end of the American empire. Remy also tosses around barbarian in reference to his son and his son's generation, which he regards as illiterate or, at best, post-literate. But somehow these intellectual strains remain extraneous and undeveloped, and it's hard to know if we're meant to take them seriously or as merely a sick man's metaphor: Remy's falling apart, so he thinks the world is. One point Arcand does make clear: If the civilization is dying, Remy and his generation did their part to kill it. Their hedonism did a number on the succeeding generation, which is most poignantly embodied by Nathalie (Marie- Josee Croze), the heroin-addicted daughter of one of Remy's former lovers. When Remy's pain becomes unbearable, Sebastien pays Nathalie to supply Remy with drugs and provide him with some companionship. Nathalie brings an unexpected and welcome element. Her rapport with Remy is born of the simple fact that she could easily beat him to the cemetery. Yet more interesting is the silent bond that seems to develop between Nathalie and Sebastien. Despite their surface disapproval of each other, and their opposite reactions to similar childhood experiences -- super-function versus phenomenal dysfunction -- they each know what the other one went through. Indeed, the younger generation in The Barbarian Invasions becomes more interesting than the older. This is especially the case once Remy's friends trudge in, veterans from Arcand's earlier The Decline of the American Empire (1986), which featured the same characters. Everyone has to say something and be given his or her moment, and they all say about the same thing, which Duke Ellington first said best: Don't get around much anymore. Yet despite a too-neat feel to the movie's final third, Arcand's groundwork is in place, and what unfolds is a series of nearly overwhelming emotional encounters. The quibbles fade, and that's the memory we take from the theater. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, strong language, sex talk and scenes of drug use. ",1
"The Baxter: Comedy. Starring Michael Showalter, Elizabeth Banks and Michelle Williams. Directed by Michael Showalter. (PG-13. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Showalter wrote, directed and stars in The Baxter, taking his inspiration from a host of '30s and '40s screwball comedies, in which guys like Ralph Bellamy and Ralph Forbes co-starred opposite fellows like Fredric March and Cary Grant and never got the girl. In The Baxter, Showalter set out to discover what happens to these fellows after the movies ended, but he doesn't quite do that. Though he begins the movie with his hero getting dumped at the altar, he doesn't proceed from there. Instead he flashes back, showing the events leading up to the wedding from the baxter's perspective. This is probably a mistake, in that it pulls back from the purity of Showalter's experiment. What would happen to a baxter in the immediate aftermath of romantic disaster? Would he be devastated? Impervious? Embarrassed? Angry? Maybe he would change. Maybe he would no longer act like a baxter -- and maybe that's why Showalter chose to tell the story the way he did. In any case, the best thing about The Baxter is its attentiveness to a kind of character whose feelings are not usually taken seriously in a romantic comedy. In that sense, Showalter does stay true to his intentions, even at the expense of conventional laughs. Here, the laughs are often uncomfortable. We first see Elliot (Showalter), a successful accountant, in his office, on the day he happens to meet the two women who will be the romantic focus of the movie: Caroline (Elizabeth Banks), a wealthy heiress, and Cecil (Michelle Williams), an office temp. His social discomfort, his solicitude and his lame attempts at banter are more painful than they are funny. It seems simple, but the challenge Showalter assumes, in his first feature as a director, is tricky: He takes an essentially unattractive character and insists on playing him accurately, even while placing him at the center of a conventionally structured romantic comedy. The results are mixed. For one thing, it's inconceivable that Caroline, who becomes his fiancee, could possibly see anything in Elliot -- so inconceivable that their courtship has to take place entirely off screen. As written, Caroline is perplexing, sometimes reasonable, sometimes stupid, sometimes authentic, sometimes vapid, sometimes real, sometimes a caricature. In short, she's a construct, not a character. Michelle Williams as Cecil has better luck, in that her affinity for Elliot is more comprehensible. They start out as friends, and she's presented as giving and sympathetic. There are some successful moments of farce and other would-be comic moments that go clunk, but for all the ups and downs, the film remains in a small way memorable, thanks to Showalter's elucidation of this often-maligned archetype. In Showalter's hands, there's a backstory to Elliot. We see his loveless life, his personality stunted through lack of feminine attention, his decades of making do, of self-recrimination, of finding other avenues for contentment; all those years of feeling pain, of avoiding pain, then becoming numb to pain, and, finally, numb to life. The Baxter is just an OK movie, but Showalter's performance is the gem to take from it. -- Advisory: Sexual situations and double entendres. ",1
"The Beat That My Heart Skipped: Drama. Starring Romain Duris and Niels Arestrup. Directed by Jacques Audiard. (Not rated. 107 minutes. At the Embarcadero Center Cinema.) That Fingers is indeed a classic needs to be said at the outset, as the advance publicity and some initial reviews for Beat have created the impression that Beat constitutes an improvement over Fingers, with Fingers being dismissed as a mere product of its time. Well, Casablanca is a product of its time. The Great Gatsby and Rhapsody in Blue are products of their time, too. But product is too small a word. To be precise, Fingers is an expression of its time. It's the story of a man's conflict between his animal and spiritual impulses, set against a nihilistic '70s backdrop of urban blight and easy sex. Beat takes the wildly improbable protagonist of Fingers -- an aspiring concert pianist working as a strong-arm man for his loan shark father -- and brings him into the realm of the plausible. Some will consider that a good thing. Thomas, the hero of Beat, works in real estate as a slum lord dealing in low-end properties and coping with squatters. An encounter with his late mother's former booking agent awakens in him a desire to make a career as a concert pianist. But his father's tortured business dealings keep getting in the way of his artistic pursuits. While the original film with Harvey Keitel as the protagonist concentrated on a man's internal struggle, Beat finds its meaning in the protagonist's personal relationships. Director Jacques Audiard (Read My Lips) lavishes attention on the scenes between Thomas (Romain Duris) and his father (Niels Arestrup), a bloated wreck of a man whose life of vice and small- time scheming is chiseled into his face. When his tenants, sensing his weakness, refuse to pay him his rent, he asks Thomas to put the squeeze on them. Thomas does it, not because he works for his father and not because he's as demented as his father or a product of the same world. He does it for the typical filial reasons: love and guilt. Thomas is practically a normal guy. His relationships with women are fairly normal, as well. He gets involved with the wife of a friend -- the friend is a louse, anyway -- and some romantic tension also seems to develop between Thomas and his Chinese piano teacher, a young woman who speaks no French and just a few words of English. Come to think of it, Thomas' relationship with music is relatively conventional, too. He has talent, and he works at it by taking daily lessons. He doesn't sit alone in his apartment, playing the same Bach toccata endlessly, like some character in an Edgar Allan Poe story -- or like Keitel in Fingers. He's under strain, but he's not close to crazy. It's a curious thing. Audiard has taken a European-style character study made by an American, and turned it into something more in the American style. The Beat That My Heart Skipped is all about circumstances: A man finds himself in a series of situations, and the movie shows how he responds. Beat is shot elegantly, and it's entertaining throughout, though in the end one might well ask what does it all mean? A man who wasn't too tormented to begin with starts taking the first steps toward an enriched existence. Good for him -- but it's not an earthshaking journey. Though offbeat and diverting, The Beat That My Heart Skipped may be ultimately most useful in calling attention to an American film and an important auteur, James Toback, who have never received their due. Fingers flopped in 1978 -- it was too intense even for the '70s -- but it holds up as a shattering, indelible experience from an intense, idiosyncratic filmmaker. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity, violence and strong language.

"The Bridesmaid: Suspense thriller. Starring Benoit Magimel and Laura Smet. Directed by Claude Chabrol. (Unrated. 110 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) No, there's something else going on, more important and more subtle, that has all to do with the performances Chabrol gets from his actors. In life, in virtually every conversation, even between adversaries, there is usually a mutual effort to exchange information and achieve stasis and resolution. (That's why people keep saying, OK? OK? all day.) But in a Chabrol film, and notably in The Bridesmaid, conversations almost never reach a comfortable plateau. There's always something hanging over, some veiled hostility, some subtly expressed disdain. The suggestion of trouble is there, and then it evaporates, to become part of the gathering cloud hanging over the characters. This quality gives every scene, even innocuous ones, an extra charge, and makes The Bridesmaid unsettling even before our hero, Philippe (Benoit Magimel) meets a sexy but needy bridesmaid (Laura Smet) at his sister's wedding. She follows him home and lures him back to her place, a massive, dilapidated and mostly unoccupied house that she inherited from her father. There she declares that they are soul mates, that she has waited for him all her life and that, from this day forward, they will be together always. To Philippe, who's lonely, this seems like unalloyed good news. But not to us. There's something about the way her eyes focus in on him as he speaks, and about the hint of a bad temper under her bland, direct surface. This may be good news for tonight, but it looks like bad news for the long haul. One day she tells him that, according to some sage, a person has not lived until he or she has 1) Planted a tree; 2) Written a poem; 3) Killed someone; and 4) Had sex with a person of the same sex. Needless to say, writing four poems -- or planting two trees and writing two poems -- is just not going to cut it. -- Advisory: The film contains strong language, nudity and sexual situations. ",1
"The Bridge: Documentary about people who have committed suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge. Directed by Eric Steel. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle talks about The Bridge.]The Bridge is a documentary film that shows people climbing over the 4-foot railing and jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. Filmed using hidden cameras over the course of 2004, it's a difficult movie to watch and a difficult movie to feel good about. It's disturbing, needless to say, but also affecting in unexpected ways. At any given time, the film shows scores of people crossing the bridge, and usually it's impossible to tell the happy from the despondent. Everyone looks like a contented tourist, and then suddenly someone breaks from the pack -- climbs, jumps and disappears. The sight inspires awe at the variety of human experience and wonder at the secret torments of people we pass on the street every day. So what do we make of such a documentary? One could argue that The Bridge is a concerned film about mental illness, whose goal is to prevent others from becoming suicides. Though it returns repeatedly to the bridge, most of it consists of interviews with friends and loved ones, talking about the people who died and the warning signs leading up to the desperate act. Yet just as easily one could see The Bridge as ghoulish and cruel, with unhappy seekers of oblivion unwittingly enlisted into a commercial feature. It's the final insult and the final intrusion, not to mention the ultimate confirmation of the world as a rotten place, that people should build reputations on the agony of others. For myself, I could make the argument either way, but both arguments are fruitless in that they end up concentrating too much on the unknowable and irrelevant -- that is, the initial motive of the director, Eric Steel. The real item under consideration here is the movie itself, and the bottom line is that it lands in a humane place. True, any viewer will go in with a certain curiosity, ghoulish or otherwise, about what it's like to jump off a bridge, and yet the overall effect of the film is broadening. To see it is to dread the bridge jumps and to come away with a feeling of compassion and empathy. Three types of individuals are shown to commit suicide in this way: (1) the severely mentally ill, paranoid schizophrenics who have known years of torment and want to end the pain, (2) chronically depressed people who, after years of threatening suicide, finally reach a crisis and (3) previously mentally healthy people who suffer an acute misfortune -- the death of a loved one, a lost job, a financial crisis, or a broken love relationship -- that knocks them sideways. Interviews conducted with the survivors talk about these lives, the different paths leading to the same sad ending. Things happen to people. Many who jump probably never anticipated that they ever would, and so the movie touches on the random miseries of life and makes comprehensible what, from a distance, would look like an insane act. At the same time, The Bridge emphasizes the tragic waste of these lives. Suicide notes are juxtaposed against the testimonies of loved ones. Over and over, friends and family describe buoyant, likable, vibrant individuals, while the notes say, I am ugly, fat and tired or I hate me. I'm a loser. The notes' descriptions aren't believable, but the friends' are, and that's the sad thing. It's always the wrong people who are hard on themselves. Steel films the Golden Gate Bridge in sunshine and shadow, lending it all the melodrama of a femme fatale in a Decadent Romantic painting. It seems overdone, but then I didn't spend a year staring at it, watching people kill themselves. In any case, Steel gives the rest of the country one heck of a travelogue -- if you're going to San Francisco, be sure to order some flowers for your funeral. He also gives us one scene for our nightmares: A tall man with long hair stands up on the railing, facing the bridge traffic, and then falls straight back into the water, like a body falling out of a closet. Try keeping that image from returning as you're trying to sleep at night. Yet the most important moment of the film is the useful and dramatic testimony of 25-year-old Kevin Hines, a rare survivor of a bridge jump. He describes what it's like to jump from the railing -- and, in that instant, regret it. -- Advisory: Even if you think you're tough, think twice. This is not only hard to watch but hard to forget.

"The Core: Science fiction. Starring Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Jon Amiel. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If there's a metaphor at work in this picture -- the planet itself is recoiling in horror at the antics of modern humanity -- it doesn't feel heavy- handed. Like those 1950s sci-fi movies inspired by nuclear terror, The Core seems unaware that it's all about expressing an anxiety lurking beneath the surface. It's a straight-ahead adventure with the usual number of thrills, but with the added virtue of being smarter and more sober than one might expect. As with most sci-fi disaster movies, the beginning -- the little-do-they- know part -- is particularly fun to watch, as it slowly dawns on people that something is wrong, very, very wrong. The first sign of electromagnetic meltdown comes when everybody with a pacemaker drops dead within a 10-block radius. The second sign comes when all the pigeons in London's Trafalgar Square lose their navigational ability and start acting as if they're in an Alfred Hitchcock movie -- smashing into windshields, breaking panes of glass. Aaron Eckhart plays Josh, a rumpled professor of geophysics who looks a lot like the rumpled professor Eckhart played in Possession. Josh is the kind of unwashed genius who can look at disparate unexplained phenomena and figure it all out: Everybody on Earth is dead in a year. Say, what? It gets worse: In less than four months, electromagnetic disruptions will cause cities to crumble with biblical abruptness. The Core is mainly about a journey to the center of the Earth, a mission to detonate a huge nuclear blast to jolt the dormant metal back into motion. That the movie never feels cabin-bound has partly to do with smart pacing. Director Jon Amiel makes frequent cuts from a spaceship-like vessel to mission control and, every so often, lets us in on some new disaster that's happening on the surface. But mainly The Core works because the characters are idiosyncratic enough to seem authentic but not so zany that they seem contrived. Hilary Swank is Rebecca, a chipper but driven co-pilot, serving under a commander, played by Bruce Greenwood with his usual humane gravity. Tcheky Karyo brings an expected joie de vivre to his role as a French weapons specialist, and Delroy Lindo is a passionate inventor. In the flashy role of an egotistical geophysicist, Stanley Tucci wisely doesn't let himself get carried away. He could have played it like Dr. Smith on Lost in Space, but doesn't. The characters interact like strangers cooped up together who have been forced to forge a makeshift familiarity. The genuineness of their rapport goes a long way toward making what is essentially a science fantasy come off like science fiction. The vessel flies downward, slicing through solid rock with a sonic laser, looking as though it's going backward through the birth canal. For some reason, it doesn't burn up. Something to do with liquid nitrogen. Outside the ship, we see giant crystals and diamonds, but mainly everything is various shades of yellow -- about as visually arresting as the inside of a child's kaleidoscope. The only special effects of real interest in The Core are in scenes taking place on the Earth's surface. Anyone who has seen the trailer knows that one American city in particular bears the destructive brunt of the sun's rays -- and surprisingly enough, it's a city known not for its sun but for its fog. And for its big orange bridge. As for the European Union, kiss Rome's Piazza Venezia goodbye. It's strange how in The Core, natural disasters have a way of focusing on the best cities and on the famous landmarks within those cities. It doesn't take a geophysicist to figure out what this is really about. The only question is whether the movie is expressing the modern fear of terrorism or merely exploiting it? Let's be charitable and assume it's doing both. . This film contains scenes of destruction. ",1
"The Dark Knight: Action. Starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Directed by Christopher Nolan. (PG-13. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Rather than have everyone skip ahead, first let's talk about Heath Ledger. He's the linchpin of The Dark Knight, and he's terrific. Director Christopher Nolan wanted to make an action movie that was different from other action movies - darker, more twisted, more despairing, more bleak - and he has mostly succeeded in this latest Batman installment. He can thank Ledger for a lot of that.The Dark Knight rides on Ledger's performance as the Joker. So does a lot of audience hope, and that's another element at work here. There has never been a situation quite like this: Audiences for the biggest blockbuster of the summer are flooding in, not just hoping an actor will be good but also expecting and needing him to be absolutely amazing. They want something profound, to put alongside Ledger's Ennis in Brokeback Mountain. They want the fabled gift that arrives six months after the loved one's death. Ledger's performance can't live up to that. Perhaps no performance ever could, but especially in this case, with the limits built into the role. Nolan and his collaborators set out to deepen the action-movie form, but the Joker remains in essence a great comic book character, not Iago (or even Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men). Nor will audiences find some of the other things they may be unconsciously looking for - a valedictory aspect or a suggestion that the role was eating the actor alive. The truth is, Ledger's death was a surprise to everybody, and The Dark Knight neither hints at it nor makes sense of it. Nothing could.But shelve those outsize expectations, and, suddenly, Ledger's performance opens up. He comes onscreen and electrifies the movie. With his smeared lipstick and painted white face, he is every clown who ever terrified a child. He speaks in a measured, Middle American accent, enunciating his words carefully, a voice that could tell bedtime stories in hell. (He seems, actually, to be imitating Al Franken.) His simplicity is fascinating, and as the movie goes on, that simplicity in itself becomes genuinely frightening.One shot, in particular, crystallizes everything that Ledger and Nolan were working for in The Dark Knight. It's a shot that deserves to be anthologized, YouTube-ized and immortalized: The Joker is in the foreground, walking toward the camera, playing (and really, that's the only word) with a bomb detonator. Huge explosions are going on behind him as he walks toward us, stiff and happy and hobbling, like a toddler. He's a child, and this is pure id. At the heart of existence isn't creation, but chaos. Not everything in The Dark Knight lives up to or even serves such moments of grim clarity. In many ways, and certainly more than Batman Begins, The Dark Knight takes the form of a standard-issue action movie. It's a little too long (though never boring) and confusingly (though beautifully) shot. It's overly plotted and has too much rapid-fire cutting. Nolan had big ambitions for the movie, but before he made The Dark Knight into a smart action film, he wanted to make sure it functioned perfectly well as a dumb one. He could have compromised less, and should have.  Still, he has taken on a serious subject and a genuine fear. If The Dark Knight is about anything, it's about civic catastrophe and the fragility of our institutions in the face of blind, consuming evil. The evil is the Joker, and no one knows what to do about him - not the good guys, like Batman (Christian Bale) or the new district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and not even the bad guys, like the mob boss played by Eric Roberts. The Joker doesn't play by the usual rules, because he isn't motivated by self-interest. In the words of Alfred the Butler (Michael Caine), he just wants to see the world burn.  This time out, Bale is almost a mere member of the ensemble, the first among equals that includes Morgan Freeman as Bruce Wayne's operations chief and Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Skillfully, the movie shifts our attention to Eckhart, who, as Gotham's idealistic young crime buster, has the movie's most involved journey. As our focus shifts, so does that of Bruce Wayne's sweetheart, Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who sees in Harvey the possibility of a stable, happy life. With its frenetic pace and its many concessions to blockbuster formula, The Dark Knight is by no means a complete success. But the more it reveals its dark heart, the better it gets, and at times it seems just a step away from achieving something extraordinary. In the end, it's no leap forward, but it's certainly a step in the right direction: an action blockbuster extravaganza that's sadder than sad and never pretends otherwise.-- Advisory: Some of the special effects are disgusting and disturbing enough to justify something more severe than the PG-13 rating. This movie is certainly not for children, nor for anyone who's afraid of clowns.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"The Day After Tomorrow: Science fiction. Starring Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Kenneth Welsh and Sela Ward. Directed by Roland Emmerich. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Areatheaters.) On the downside, some of the dialogue is corny, but you know what? No one goes to The Day After Tomorrow expecting a Noel Coward play. There are also some moments that are funny without anyone intending them to be, and that's a bit of a problem. But the movie offers many other moments that are astonishing. Here's one: Two men walk along the now-frozen body of water that divides Manhattan and Staten Island, and they pass the Statue of Liberty, now frozen over and buried waist deep in snow. Like everything else these days, that shot was done on computer. But for once it doesn't look like it. Instead, writer-director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) takes an enormous, compelling situation, lays it out meticulously and lures viewers into his fantasy. Along the way, The Day After Tomorrow even proves itself ambitious, making a sincere, if somewhat ham-fisted, case that something needs to be done about global warming. It's rare to see a blockbuster take anything resembling a clear-cut political stand. As in every disaster movie ever made, this one stars its Cassandra, who knows the future, warns everybody about it and, in return, gets treated like an eccentric crank. Dennis Quaid plays Jack, a climatologist who realizes that something is very wrong when he notices an ice shelf cracking that should be frozen solid. At a government hearing, he warns that the change in the Gulf Stream caused by global warming will eventually result in a dramatic decrease in temperature. But the vice president (Kenneth Welsh) interrupts him to criticize the Kyoto accords and dismisses him as a dreamer. But he's not dreaming. Soon scary stuff is happening: Tornados in Hollywood. Ice chunks raining down from the heavens in Tokyo. Tsunamis in the Northeast. And seriously alarming turbulence for airline passengers. Since Emmerich's Independence Day, there hasn't been a disaster movie on such a scale, nor one so well executed or enjoyable. Though the movie depicts an international cataclysm, the story mainly divides itself between the exploits of Jack, in Washington, D.C., and those of his son (Jake Gyllenhaal), who finds himself stranded inside Manhattan's great Fifth Avenue library as conditions worsen and temperatures drop. Emmerich relies more on the personal in The Day After Tomorrow than he did in Independence Day, the main reason the new movie is weaker in comparison. Yet it's difficult to see how he had much of a choice. In The Day After Tomorrow,  there's no villain, no enemy to fight and no obvious climax. When Jack decides he needs to go to New York to rescue his son, the plot turn may seem faintly absurd (what will he do once he gets there?), but Emmerich obviously needed a story. It's good enough. Of course, Quaid acts as though the story is considerably better than good enough. He acts as though he were in Macbeth, playing Jack forcefully and with no irony. His straight-ahead seriousness may be slightly misplaced at times -- the script sometimes fails him -- but his commitment is still admirable, and the movie benefits. He's a rock. So is Sela Ward, who approaches the role of his wife, an oncologist, with a similar, if less intense, gravity. Emmerich clearly did not want The Day After Tomorrow to be yet another smirky blockbuster. The movie's politics will create some controversy. Emmerich is clearly pointing the finger at the current administration. His vice president, a scowling cynic, bears a slight resemblance to the real-life one, while the president is portrayed as an unprepossessing fellow who stumbles up midway, wearing a baseball cap and looking completely lost. Faced with a disaster in the making, the best he can manage is to turn to the vice president and ask, What should we do? Such moments will have Democrats rolling in the aisles, but Republicans can also take pleasure in The Day After Tomorrow. Though the storm is devastating, anyone paying close attention will not fail to observe that it wreaks the most havoc on northern states and urban populations, thus guaranteeing the GOP an electoral lock after the next census. -- Advisory: This film contains scenes of chaos, doom and destruction.

"The Departed: Crime drama. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson and Vera Farmiga. Directed by Martin Scorsese. (R. 149 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies. The Departed breaks that cycle. There's no attempt at greatness here, just a fabulously successful attempt at a good crime movie. The Oscar-bait self-consciousness of Gangs of New York and The Aviator is gone. In its place is a buoyancy, an impish delight in telling a harsh urban story in the most effective terms possible. Two external proofs of the movie's expert direction: It makes a complicated and potentially convoluted story and delivers it to the audience with pristine clarity. And it's a 149-minute film that, in the experience, plays as though it were less than two hours long. The Aviator was only about 20 minutes longer, but I've had entire months go by quicker than that. But The Departed moves from one colorful, well-acted scene to the next, thanks also to William Monahan's witty, well-paced screenplay. A remake of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), The Departed has a clever premise at its core: In the police department, there is a spy working for a gang leader. And in the gang leader's crew, there's a spy working for the police department. Early on, both sides know they've been infiltrated, and each side is looking for the mole in its organization. Each mole is looking for the other mole, and that's the story. The rest is window dressing, but very good dressing. We begin with Jack Nicholson as Costello, an Irish mob boss in Boston, seducing a neighborhood boy into his gang by buying him comic books and groceries. Scorsese playfully shoots Nicholson in the shadows for these first few scenes. In one, he is just a silhouette, while everyone else is in the light. The message is clear: This is the devil, the spirit of mayhem, the agent of destruction, a monster. He is also a fun character to watch. Nicholson doesn't sleepwalk through this one, but responds with a psychologically detailed portrait of an old, twisted murderer. Years later, the little boy that Costello took an interest in has grown up to become an ambitious young police investigator, Sullivan (Matt Damon), the picture of clean-cut competence and dependability. Another young Boston officer, rougher around the edges, has a harder time making his way. Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) reluctantly agrees to go undercover and become part of the Costello gang. All the undercover scenes are tense -- Costello is amusing but wicked, and Costigan is always in the position of trying to catch on to the esoteric aspects of gang life. For example, he is told that there are guys you can hit, guys you can't hit, and other guys who tell you who can be hit or not. That's useful information, and it's also absurd, and in keeping with an undertone of absurdity that runs through the film. On the police side, we have the frustrating but arresting spectacle of watching young Sullivan con everyone with his eager-beaver demeanor and aggressive charm. He picks up a police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga), and even when she moves in with him, she can't quite see past his former-altar-boy facade. DiCaprio and Damon have never been better. Scorsese finds big names to fill even minor roles -- everyone wants to work with Scorsese, just as everyone wants to work with Woody Allen. The difference is Scorsese knows what to do with these actors once he gets them. The performances are specific and idiosyncratic, the mark of a strong directorial hand. Alec Baldwin plays Sullivan's boss, a neighborhood guy with normally good instincts, who's in over his head. Martin Sheen is a chief investigator, playing him with the demeanor of a mild Catholic family man. And Mark Wahlberg steals every scene he's in, as Sheen's brutally caustic second in command. As The Departed wears on, it becomes more exciting, more grimly funny and more nihilistic -- and that nihilism has a lasting impact. When I walked out of The Departed and left the San Francisco Centre, Mission Street looked like a very evil place. In fact, everything looked evil and dangerous, until I went home and had a drink. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, strong language and extreme violence. ",1
"The Devil Wears Prada: Comedy-drama. Starring Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt. Directed by David Frankel. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The second seduction is what makes the movie. That's our seduction, as an audience watching The Devil Wears Prada. We come into it, most of us at least, in a state of innocence, knowing little about the ways of New York's fashion oracles. We're immediately shocked (though amused) by the rudeness, the cutthroat cruelty and the callousness. And then about three-quarters in, we understand it. Their behavior makes sense, not just in a psychological sense but also in a twisted moral sense. We grasp the life view and the code of behavior, and in doing so realize we've just completed our own journey to the dark side. Thanks to Meryl Streep, whose performance as the editor in chief of the world's most influential fashion magazine is eerie perfection, The Devil Wears Prada is often quite funny. But it's more than that, a film that reveals an entire vibrant and sleazy world that most viewers would never have a hint of, much less experience. Based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger, Prada just feels authentic, from its glossy look to the specific and sometimes curious behavior of the secondary and tertiary characters. To watch it is like being entertained while getting an anthropological crash course. The fashion-world rudeness seems to derive from a belief (or recognition) that people are as replaceable as styles, and that, just as only a few styles are acceptable at any given moment, the same could be said for individuals. The practitioners of this philosophy accept that these rules apply to themselves as well, and so they feel no impulse for phony courtesy in dealing with others. To be nice would only encourage weakness or instill a false assurance. Thus, when young Andy (Anne Hathaway) shows up for her interview at Runway magazine, she's met with a barrage of insults and snide comments by the boss' first assistant, Emily (Emily Blunt) -- though the contempt is curiously without any particular malice, as though the assistant has learned the drill without feeling it. The stage is set for Streep's entrance as the dreaded boss, Miranda. Word gets out that she has arrived in the building early, which creates pandemonium in the office as desks are cleared, hair and clothing are primped and comfortable shoes are replaced with high heels. We're led to expect a screaming harpy, but Streep is too smart an actress for that. She's the boss, and the boss doesn't have to raise her voice. Instead, she speaks in a quiet monotone, complaining and giving orders with an air of mildly pained bewilderment. Her most vicious comments begin in seemingly innocuous ways, with Why is it impossible that ... or I really don't understand why ... Miranda is much scarier than a demanding, screaming boss. She takes pleasure in slipping inside her employees' minds and torturing them. At first, Andy lives a schizophrenic existence, working at the center of the couture world, while dressing like a zhlub and living with a scruffy boyfriend (Adrian Grenier). But soon she starts dressing fashionably, and this is where the movie threatens to hit a snag. It suggests that Andy, who never looked better in her life, is compromising her values, though what inherent value is there in looking like a slob? It also posits her relationship with her boyfriend as the shining beacon of her life. Yet there's nothing special about the relationship, and, anyway, they're both really young. A 23-year-old is allowed to change without it being assumed that she's on a moral slide. Perhaps she's simply growing in another direction. If the filmmakers really wanted to make Andy go wrong, they should have done it for real, instead of expecting that the frustration of her hippie friends should carry moral weight with an audience. Fortunately, the story of Andy is just an excuse to show us what Andy witnesses -- the world from the inside of the limousine, Paris at night, the front row at a high-fashion runway, how fashion designers intermingle with fashion editors, what those people say, how they think. This is where Streep is extraordinary, letting us see how Miranda inhabits that world with a complete understanding of people's frailties, machinations and desires. Miranda may be alarming on the outside, but on the inside she's terrifying. She doesn't even truly subscribe to the twisted, people-are-interchangeable ethos that she expects her underlings to live by. She's indispensable. She's the queen. Beneath Streep's coldness, there's more coldness, and beneath that coldness is something worse. She makes you feel that the devil really does wear Prada. -- Advisory: There is a sexual interlude. ",1
"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly: Drama. Starring Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Seigner, Marie-Josee Croze and Anne Consigny. (PG-13. 112 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Jean-Dominique Bauby led a glamorous life as the editor of the French Elle magazine, but his lasting contribution to human consciousness has nothing to do with his carefree years as a man about town. His contribution is The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which he wrote after suffering a devastating stroke. The book, which he dictated by blinking his left eye, makes it forever impossible to forget or ignore the humanity inside people experiencing the most physically distorting and debilitating of illnesses. Speaking from the absolute depths, using the most thin and tenuous line of communication, Bauby assured people of an indestructible human essence inside the destructible human body.  In adapting the book, director Julian Schnabel and screenwriter Ronald Harwood overcame great difficulties. The subject matter is disturbing. The story, about a 43-year-old man paralyzed from head to toe, is infinitely sad. Bauby's book follows no linear story, but is rather a series of vignettes and ruminations. And, of course, with a paralyzed protagonist, the screen action is limited. Lesser artists would have taken a programmatic approach to the material: They would have either told most of the story in flashback, with Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) appearing mainly in his able-bodied incarnation; or they would have pitched their tent almost entirely in the land of fantasy, a sentimental approach with occasional hospital pit stops. Instead, Schnabel begins the film with a subjective camera, so that we see the world through Bauby's eyes as he wakes up to find himself in a hospital. We soon become familiar with his limited field of vision and aware that he can't move his head - thus things keep happening outside the frame. We hear Bauby's thoughts, and knowing what he wants to say helps us to feel just a hint of his frustration at not being able to communicate.  It takes some time for Bauby to realize that his imagination can help ease his misery, and that's when the fantasy sequences come. But Schnabel uses them sparingly and with care. He never pretends that imagination can offer anything more than temporary consolation, and so beautiful sequences of a magical hospital corridor, with miracle cures or a leaping Nijinsky, land with a thud into reality. The film's title describes the movie's delicate balance between taking wing and staying trapped with Bauby inside the physical equivalent of a diving bell.  Schnabel doesn't routinely give us extended shots of Bauby until about a third of the way through, and it's only when we're used to him in his disabled condition that we start getting flashbacks to Bauby in his able-bodied state. The difference is a shock, and it becomes impossible to look at him healthy without thinking of the illness to come.  Schnabel injects some sex appeal in the movie by casting beautiful women in every available role, including those of the nurses. Their beauty is a comfort to Bauby but also a point of rueful contemplation. The actresses - Emmanuelle Seigner as his ex-wife; Marie-Josee Croze as his speech therapist and Anne Consigny as his amanuensis - become the film's heart, each of them conveying moments of profound emotion. They do it without a tinge of bathos, and while looking straight into the camera. Max von Sydow, who appears in a couple of scenes as Bauby's father, is painfully effective.  By the end, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly achieves a victory over difficult material, but celebrating that fact doesn't preclude recognizing the story is not a natural for movies and remains an uneasy match. Still, it was a story that needed to be told, and Harwood and Schnabel told it better than anyone else could have. -- Advisory: Nudity, strong language.",1
"The Dying Gaul: Psychological thriller. Starring Peter Sarsgaard, Campbell Scott and Patricia Clarkson. Directed by Craig Lucas. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Over the course of the film, the three central characters go through a series of transformations, deepening and hardening, shifting gears and maneuvering, revealing sides of themselves that they didn't know about and that surprise us. Written by Craig Lucas, based on his play, it was also directed by Lucas, his first feature film. Lucas' insight into the subtleties of interaction -- and the churning depths that those subtleties suggest -- is of a whole other order than that of most film directors. In this psychological thriller, the psychological isn't neglected; it's intrinsic. The film travels a lot of emotional ground in 105 minutes. In its first seconds, it could even be mistaken for a Hollywood satire. Campbell Scott plays Jeffrey, a successful producer, and he wants to buy a screenplay from Robert (Peter Sarsgaard), a struggling writer. The screenplay is all about the death of Robert's lover from AIDS, but Jeffrey wants a fundamental change: He doesn't want the protagonist to be a gay man, but a straight woman. The clue that Lucas is not interested in satire is that Jeffrey hardly comes across as a boor. His arguments in favor of the change make sense. He's persuasive. In addition, he has a beautiful home -- not only huge and expensive, but tasteful, with a stunning view -- and the intelligent good sense of his wife, Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), speaks well of him. Thus, as Lucas sets it up, we have three people, more or less well-meaning and more or less honest. Sure, they're self-interested and their relationships are all tied up with commerce, but that's life. In that nice California way, they become friendly very quickly and feel sure they know the others inside out, even as they hold on to their own secrets. The immediate intimacy of the characters has both the ring of truth and a sadness about it. The sadness is that it's not at all phony, but it's not real, either. What feels like closeness, a true meeting of minds, is in fact just coziness, an expression of the desire to connect, not a real connection. Robert and Elaine, talking at the end of a movie screening, have their heads almost touching, and they look like best friends. They even think they're becoming best friends. What they're becoming is, in fact, something a lot more complicated. Lucas creates an intense set of circumstances in which each character desperately needs something from the other two characters and has a specific reason to fear the other two characters, as well. It's best to leave the details vague. Suffice it to say that the situations and emotions that Lucas puts into place reach an intensity worthy of the film's title. It's taken from the haunting Roman sculpture, housed in Rome's Capitoline Museum, of a naked Gallic soldier, dying of wounds on the battlefield. Lucas builds in effective wordless interludes that never once suggest a director trying to open up the play but rather an artist using the opportunities of film to communicate more meaning. In an early sequence, Elaine reads the original version of Robert's screenplay (called The Dying Gaul) and is moved to tears at precisely the moment that Robert, in his apartment, is preparing to start chopping up his work at the behest of her husband. The performances of Sarsgaard, Clarkson and Scott are outstanding. One thinks of them here as an ensemble -- vulnerable, defensive and monstrous. Much of the movie takes place with Robert and Elaine online, speaking to each other in chat rooms, through aliases. Onstage, these scenes would inevitably have to be static, but through voiceovers, flashbacks and graceful camera movement, Lucas makes these interludes dynamic. -- Advisory: This film contains simulated sex interludes and strong language.

"The Exorcism of Emily Rose: Drama. Starring Laura Linney, Campbell Scott, Tom Wilkinson and Jennifer Carpenter. Directed by Scott Derrickson. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Two stories are intertwined. Emily (Jennifer Carpenter) is dead from the beginning, but her ordeal is rendered in a harrowing series of flashbacks. Meanwhile, the priest (Tom Wilkinson) who presided over the unsuccessful exorcism is on trial for negligent homicide. So the film unfolds as a horror movie and a courtroom drama combined, with the reasonable, staid atmosphere of the court scenes serving to accentuate the horror. In most horror movies, the whole world has gone mad, but the courtroom aspect here provides a frame for the horror that makes it all seem quite possible, or probable -- and even scarier for its being a part of recognizable, daily life. Emily is a normal teenage girl who is visited one night by an invisible entity that starts moving things around her room and attempting to get inside her. She pushes the demon off, but the demon -- or demons -- come back, and the next time they set up camp inside her, making life hell. In one particularly stark and memorable scene, she is sitting in a cafe and can hear nothing but the sound of forks and knives clinking against plates. The sense of brutal isolation is conveyed. Emily runs out onto the street, and as she passes ostensibly normal people, their faces transform into demon faces. A minor metaphysical question: When Emily sees a demon in these people, is she hallucinating, or is she actually seeing what is really in people, even if they themselves are unaware? It's a chilling thought, just as chilling as the moment when Emily rushes into a church for sanctuary, looking as calm and unruffled as Munch's The Scream, and finds that the people sitting in the pews have demon faces, too. Laura Linney plays the priest's lawyer, Erin, a woman who has never given much thought to the spirit world. Her career is her religion. An agnostic, she has the task of trying to make the jury agnostic on the subject of science: A series of prosecution experts testify that Emily was suffering from an exotic form of psychosis with an epileptic component, and Erin's job is to make the jury doubt it. Curiously, and intentionally, Emily Rose has the scientists' explanation sounding more convoluted and far-fetched -- more voodoo, in its way -- than the priest's. The continued presence of the spirit world unites the past and present halves of the movie, with invisible demons doing things to menace and unnerve Erin and the priest daily at 3 in the morning (the witching hour). Meanwhile, the viewer is never allowed to forget the visceral torment of possession. In The Exorcist, Linda Blair was scary. In Emily Rose, what's happening to Emily is scary. She tears her hair out, eats insects, experiences grotesque convulsions and scrapes her nails against the wall, but even as the demons are making her do these things, she remains in some way conscious and present. Talk about hell. The film gives Linney a chance to play someone sharp and aggressive again after a few years of playing softies, lightweights, witnesses and victims. She expands in the role. Wilkinson lends intensity and conviction to the priest. As for newcomer Carpenter, one could easily overlook her merely as that poor possessed girl. But that's a performance, and a strong one. The mood created by these human stars is augmented enormously by the film's other star -- the soundtrack -- which starts humming, vibrating and bringing on an ominous chorus every time it's 3 in the morning. The sound is loud, but the effect is so subtle that some people might not even notice it. It's the sound of being too scared to think straight. -- Advisory: This film contains frightening scenes of possession, gruesome images and torment. ",1
"The Final Cut: Drama. Starring Robin Williams, Mira Sorvino and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Omar Naim (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet movies are not only about stories. They open doors in the imagination, and in that way The Final Cut can't be dismissed. It takes place in a world akin to our own, but one in which an item called a Zoe chip has been in existence for more than three generations. It's a device, implanted into the brain prenatally, that records everything a human being sees and hears, until the moment of death. After death, the chip is taken out, and a cutter edits the hundreds of thousands of hours into a two-hour feature, to be shown at a Rememory service for family and friends. Robin Williams plays an expert cutter, a role that makes good use of Williams' tendency to look incurably depressed. Like a priest or an emergency room doctor, a cutter is forced into a daily confrontation with human frailty and perfidy. With Williams -- whose aura of misery doesn't seem self- indulgent but rather the result of a heightened sensitivity to others' suffering -- we understand the toll this takes. It's in his haunted eyes, in his tentativeness and his inability to engage with people. He sees entire lives, but he sees only the surfaces of those lives, not the thoughts or the imagination, where most of life is lived. Watching life in this all-consuming and yet limited way could undoubtedly give anyone a suffocating sense of entrapment -- of being stuck inside a limited perspective, which is, in a sense, the human condition. The cutter goes through life knowing too much about other people, and yet not enough. What are people's lives like? the hero's on-and-off girlfriend (Mira Sorvino) asks. Do they make sense? He doesn't answer, but he doesn't have to. For him, it's all sound and pictures, signifying nothing. His job is to impose meanings in the editing, meanings he knows are false. If that's not enough to make a man gloomy, The Final Cut raises the stakes. Alan (Williams) is such a brilliant cutter that people come to him with the most difficult cases -- in other words, to edit the lives of the most horrible people. In an eerie scene, Williams debuts a Rememory for the deceased's surviving brother, a touching montage of family memories. But when the brother leaves and Alan is alone, he plays what he's edited out, a scene of the man beating his wife. The story turns on one particular case: A sleazy businessman has unexpectedly died, and the family has entrusted Alan with the task of converting a life of cruelty and deceit into an inspiring saga of family, career and community. But Jim Caviezel wants Alan to turn the dead businessman's Zoe disc over to him. He wants to bring down the businessman's crooked empire and use the footage as a way of encouraging the public to do away with Zoe technology. The thriller aspects all derive from Caviezel's end of the story, but the best things in The Final Cut are its mood, its presentation of the hero's emotional dislocation and the incidental glimpses we get into his work. First- time writer-director Omar Naim creates the sense of a culture fundamentally distorted as a result of a single invention. Young people -- anti-Zoe hippies -- sport elaborate tattoos and carve grotesque corrugations into their faces in protest. People don't know how to behave with each other. No one knows if the other might be sporting a Zoe chip. As The Final Cut takes place in an alternate version of our world, Naim feels under no obligation to account for changing styles, and so when he depicts people's memories of 50 years earlier, the world looks identical to that of 2004. This is a justifiable strategy, and may have been made in the interest of economy, but it robs the movie of some texture. But then, perhaps that was the idea: The lives seem even more senseless, if there's none of the forward motion suggested by a changing landscape. -- Advisory: This film contains mature themes, violence and sexuality.

"The Five Obstructions: Documentary. Starring Lars von Trier and Jorgen Leth. Directed by Lars von Trier and Jorgen Leth. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In The Five Obstructions, he is paired with his temperamental and artistic opposite, Jorgen Leth, a former mentor of his and a grand old man of Danish cinema. While Leth is a formalist, whose films are pristine, reserved and meticulous, von Trier is a freewheeling and rambunctious filmmaker, who sometimes revels in sloppiness. Their visions collide in this one-of-a-kind documentary that's both fascinating in its personality dynamic and intellectually challenging, a pleasure for anyone interested in art, cinema and aesthetics. The film's pretext is this: In 1967, Leth made a stark black-and-white short called The Perfect Human, which showed a man and a woman going through the mechanics of daily life with cold precision. Von Trier proposes that Leth remake The Perfect Human five times, each time following difficult limitations -- or obstructions -- devised by von Trier. For the first short, von Trier decrees that Leth must film his remake in Cuba, without a set, and that there must be an edit at least once every 12 frames, or half second. For another, he insists that Leth remake his film as a cartoon, even though both dislike cartoons. In fact, he insists on a cartoon precisely because they dislike cartoons. Through these obstructions, von Trier is trying to crack through Leth's aloof artistic facade, if it is indeed a facade, and to induce him into making a mess. But Leth keeps overcoming von Trier's obstacles, making a series of shorts that are cool, structured and integrated. We not only get to see the genesis of each film and the making of each film, but we also see the films themselves. The Five Obstructions emerges as not just a friendly competition, but as an elucidation of two visions of life and art -- and the audience becomes a participant, changing sympathies more than once as the film wears on. -- Advisory: This film contains brief nudity.

"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy: Sci-fi comedy. Starring Martin Freeman, Mos Def, Zooey Deschanel and Sam Rockwell. Directed by Garth Jennings. (PG. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If this dazzle were merely technological, the movie would start unraveling after an amusing 45 minutes. But it doesn't. The movie hangs together and gets by with more than a margin of goodwill because the dazzle it offers is one of the mind. And although everyone connected with the film deserves credit, including director Garth Jennings, the mind that we unquestionably encounter in Hitchiker's is that of Douglas Adams, the late sci-fi author and creator of the Hitchhiker series. It's a singular consciousness -- wildly imaginative, humane, playful and deflating of all pretense. Audiences will be won over from the first sequence, in which dolphins keep trying to warn humans that the Earth is about to be demolished. Finally they give up and leave the earth, saying So long, and thanks for all the fish, which becomes the title of the old-time music hall number that runs under the credits. It's the end of the world, and no one knows it. The earth is about to be obliterated to make way for an intergalactic superhighway, but in the meantime, everyone goes about their mundane concerns, including Arthur (Martin Freeman of the BBC'S The Office). Arthur, a brooding sensitive soul, becomes one of the lucky ones, when his friend Ford (Mos Def), secretly an alien, arranges for them to be lifted up to a spaceship seconds before the big bang. In the course of their travels, they run into Trillian (Zooey Deschanel), whom Arthur once tried to pick up, and her new boyfriend, Zaphod (Sam Rockwell), the flamboyant and utterly superficial president of the galaxy. Zaphod is scouring the galaxy for the secret of the universe, but that's just the movie's transparently flimsy pretext for keeping the story in motion. In Hitchhiker's, it's not about the big picture, and it's not about wondering how it will end. It's about the moment-to-moment. In several episodes, the crew encounters Vogons, heavy, lumbering space citizens who are not evil, just bureaucratic and bad tempered. (They have no imagination, Ford explains. They just run things.) Unencumbered by any need to be plausible, the movie shifts gears and changes locations seemingly at will, but there's always something to see and enjoy along the way. In the most visually elaborate sequence, Arthur gets a tour of a tremendous factory floor, where whole planets are custom-made. Martin Freeman, as an intelligent, skeptical everyman, makes a likable surrogate for the audience. He's an easy fellow to root for, though his combination of stammering and shy sniping in his scenes with Deschanel does wear out its welcome. Deschanel, with her offbeat delivery and otherworldly blue eyes make her an ideal mock sci-fi heroine, and Mos Def -- a rapper who doesn't need to be cool all the time -- rightly abandons himself to silliness. Speaking of abandon, something about playing Chuck Barris must have unlocked Rockwell, because he plays Zaphod with the freedom and spontaneity of a comic pro. In a topical touch, Zaphod is used for a few gentle jabs at George W. Bush. Familiar voices appear throughout. Stephen Fry narrates, and Helen Mirren is the voice of the oracle known as Deep Thought. The one voice most viewers will recognize is that of Alan Rickman, unmistakable as the chronically depressed Marvin, an overly intelligent robot cursed with a human personality. ",1
"The Hoax: Drama. Starring Richard Gere, Alfred Molina, Marcia Gay Harden, Hope Davis and Julie Delpy. Directed by Lasse Hallström. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the early 1970s, Irving lied to McGraw-Hill publishers, claiming to be the conduit through which the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes was pouring forth his autobiography. If you believe the movie, he didn't exactly do it out of greed, though the money was considerable. Rather he did it to be a big shot, with everything that implies: to be treated with respect, to be in the game, to have a life of splendor, to be somebody. This yearning makes Irving's saga an emblematic American story, about a man who wanted more, but it's even more interesting than that. Irving may, in fact, have deserved more. Thus, The Hoax becomes the story of a fascinating person who accepted the world's challenge and decided to fight it on its own terms. The world valued flash, bluff and celebrity, and that's what he gave it. In at least one significant way, as the movie shows, he was ahead of his time. His autobiography of Howard Hughes was just an extreme example of the current tendency to blur fiction and nonfiction. But clearly he would have preferred serving up the fiction honestly: As the film begins, Irving (Richard Gere) is within breathing distance of the brass ring. He's about to get a fat contract from McGraw-Hill for his new novel, along with serialization in Life magazine -- 35 years ago, there was nothing more that a writer could hope for. And then just as quickly as the dream materializes in front of him, it vanishes. The deal collapses, and he's back at square one. The Hughes idea comes to him by chance, but once he commits himself to it, he applies himself with meticulousness and tenacity and becomes a convincing forger. He writes a letter as Hughes, designating Clifford Irving as the writer of his authorized biography -- and with just a few forged letters, he soon has all the executives at McGraw-Hill treating him like a lord and handing him checks for six figures. First they wouldn't buy his fiction, and then they were buying it without knowing it. The Hoax details the ways in which Irving went about researching and writing the fake autobiography. With his friend and partner, Dick Susskind (Alfred Molina), Irving does the necessary fieldwork, interviewing Hughes' old associates and listening to recordings of Hughes' voice to learn the patterns and rhythms of his speech. Almost from the beginning, Irving is fighting a war on three fronts: (1) Making a convincing product, (2) selling it and (3) defending it as doubts begin to surface. All three efforts take the nerve of a world-class gambler and talents both literary and personal. Richard Gere is the ideal actor for the role. When his Clifford Irving is bluffing or intimidating the McGraw-Hill honchos, it's easy to see him as the biggest guy in the room, as the one man on a grand scale surrounded by cretins who'd suffocate him. At the same time, Gere makes Irving's flaws easy to believe. Irving's profound yearning is a tendency that often accompanies real talent. Yet his struggles with authenticity, in every aspect of his life, make us doubt his artistic capacity. That's the conundrum at the heart of The Hoax. Was his con the desperate act of an artist spurned, or was it the ultimate expression of a different kind of artist, one whose only true talent is lying? As Gere plays it, that question is not only within us but within Irving, too. Director Lasse Hallström and screenwriter William Wheeler (adapting Irving's confessional book) turn The Hoax into a personal story with broad implications for the culture as a whole. And they don't make it easy. For one thing, Clifford's struggle for his soul is embodied by his inability to choose between Edith (Marcia Gay Harden), his devoted but scowling wife, and Nina Van Pallandt (Julie Delpy), a superficial would-be actress, who is rich, charming and looks like a young Catherine Deneuve. Under such circumstances, Irving's reasoning becomes understandable: In some circumstances, the lie just feels more true than the truth. -- Advisory: Strong language and nudity. ",1
"The Illusionist: Drama. Starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell. Directed by Neil Burger. (PG-13. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Edward Norton plays the master illusionist, the greatest magician of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and aside from Norton's difficulty in mastering any dialect besides his own, he is well cast. Norton has an innate capacity always to seem like the voice of reason, a capacity he invariably uses to good effect in playing characters who are anything but reasonable, who are fantastic or bizarre in their behavior. With Norton as a magician -- a conjurer with a seeming ability to create life and bring back souls from the dead -- anything is possible, either that he's a remarkably skilled showman or in league with the devil. Norton, with his natural blitheness, is nicely paired with Paul Giamatti, an actor who is as fraught as Norton is casual. Giamatti plays a police chief allied to the Crown Prince Leopold, who finds that his natural sympathies and honest impulses are at war with his ambition. The cat-and-mouse game that develops between the illusionist and the police officer, both clever men, is one particularly rewarding aspect of The Illusionist. Circumstances may pit them against each other -- as the film begins, the police chief is closing down the illusionist show and declaring him under arrest. Yet the audience's impulse is to root for them both. In this way, The Illusionist is very much reminiscent of a forgotten 1932 picture called Arsene Lupin, starring John Barrymore as a master art thief and his brother Lionel Barrymore as the detective determined to put him behind bars. The challenge there was the same as here -- to craft an elaborate story that ultimately satisfies the audience's affection for both conflicting characters. In both films, the success is complete. After beginning the film at a moment of drama and pandemonium, writer-director Neil Burger backs up to tell the tale from the beginning, that of a poor boy and young duchess who fall in love and are separated. After 15 years of traveling and developing his abilities as a magician, the boy returns as Eisenheim the illusionist, a major attraction, and she attends his show as Sophie (Jessica Biel), the all-but-definite future wife of Leopold, the heir to the throne. There is something about a magic trick: A good one is fun to watch, even in a movie, in which the camera set-ups are multiple and any illusion is possible. When Eisenheim performs, making plants grow and butterflies appear, he doesn't just seduce the on-screen audience but the audience watching in the movie theater. Part of the kick of the film is in witnessing the magic tricks. Eisenheim and Sophie are still in love, of course, but the crown prince is not a man to be disposed of easily. If he were any crown prince, he'd be a formidable obstacle, but this one, especially, is bad news, a willful, surly, touchy, competitive bully. In just a handful of illustrative moments, Burger and Sewell bring home the prince's character with unmistakable clarity. In one scene, he invites Eisenheim to give a command performance and can't resist jumping on stage to debunk his tricks. The prince's compulsive resentment of any situation in which he's not the center of attention embarrasses everyone present. The Illusionist puts a number of balls in play: The love of Eisenheim and Sophie, the ruthlessness of Leopold, and the inspector's dilemma -- he admires Eisenheim but his professional ambitions are tied up in his connection with the crown prince. Burger, whose only previous film was a low budget independent, Interview With the Assassin, keeps all these balls in the air, and they don't land until he tells them to. It's a job of conjuring in itself. -- Advisory: This film contains some sexuality and violence. ",1
"The Incredible Hulk:Sci-fi action. Starring Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt. Directed by Louis Leterrier. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.)Sequels are so 20th century. So are remakes. What we're getting now are do-overs. Two years ago we got a new Superman. Next month we get The Dark Knight, which will be the second in a new series of Batman movies. Even an old-schooler like Sylvester Stallone got into the spirit earlier this year, with a second movie called Rambo. The reason this can be done is the target audience for these movies is so young that a few years in the past feels to them like ancient history.But at least they got this do-over right. The Incredible Hulk, the second adaptation this decade of the Marvel comic-book story, is a big improvement over 2003's Hulk, which was directed by Ang Lee. He tried to make a thinking person's action movie, but ended up with a film suffering from multiple-personality syndrome, part dull and earnest, part mindless and violent. The Incredible Hulk, by contrast, embraces its identity as a sci-fi-summer-action-blockbuster extravaganza. Along the way, it actually comes close to finding the balance that Lee was looking for.The result is not as good as Iron Man, but it's an action movie in that style, willing to take its time and take advantage of the fact that it has a first-rate actor at its center. As a concession to the existence of the previous Hulk movie - though every aspect of it, from the look and the casting on down has been reconceived - we find Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) as a man already coping with his hulkness. Like Dr. Jekyll or a someone in 12-step recovery, Bruce is just trying to get by, one day at a time, working in a Brazilian bottling plant by day and taking private classes in anger management and self-discipline. He knows that if he gets angry, if his heart rate gets up to 200, he will turn into a tremendous green muscle man and start taking apart everything and everybody. But Bruce is a man on the run. He may want to slip beneath the radar and live with his condition until he can be cured, but the U.S. government - in the person of General Ross (William Hurt) - has other ideas. The Army wants to study Bruce and figure out the science behind what's happening to him, so as to create other Hulks. They want to weaponize the Hulk technology.The Incredible Hulk is a chase movie, in a sense, but it's not all about running. There are quiet interludes and genuinely poignant moments that don't feel forced or phony but organic to the study. The movie benefits from an unguarded purity of essence that Liv Tyler brings to the role of Betty, Bruce's ex-girlfriend and true love; and Norton grounds the whole movie in his matter-of-fact understanding of Bruce's predicament. He plays him as stoic, realistic and full of regrets that he has learned to ignore just to get through the day. A key moment comes early in the movie, in which Bruce, following a Hulk episode, wakes up almost naked in Guatemala. It could have been a joke scene. It's not. It could have been overplayed for sympathy. It isn't. He's just a man with a problem, and we sympathize. Credit must go to Norton (who also co-wrote the screenplay) but also to director Louis Leterrier, for his intelligent sense of proportion. Here there's no disconnect between the Hulk and Bruce. They are still the same man, and Leterrier keeps reminding us gently of Bruce's physical vulnerability, through shots such as the one of Norton's white, thin back, as he lay exhausted. His strain is almost unbearable. Leterrier's intelligence and balance extends to the casting. Of course, he gets the big roles right - Hurt as the ruthless general, Tim Roth as the head of his assault team - but he also does well with the smaller ones: Lou Ferrigno (TV's Hulk) as a security guard, Paul Soles as a wise old restaurateur, and Ty Burrell as Betty's psychiatrist boyfriend. Best of all there's Tim Blake Nelson, who brings a blast of energy to his role as a scientist so intellectually engaged, so carried away with his ideas, that he's borderline crazy - not a mad scientist, but one step before that.Meanwhile, casually, almost incidentally, a fairly serious idea slips through. This Hulk technology could set broken bones in minutes. It could regenerate cells. It could reverse spinal injury and maybe cure cancer, and yet what would happen if such technology existed? Picture armies of Hulks, all killing each other.-- Advisory:Disturbing Hulk violence and mayhem.",1
"The Interpreter: Suspense thriller. Starring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn. Directed by Sydney Pollack. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Interpreter is an old-fashioned thriller, from a director who was making such thrillers when they were new-fashioned. Like his Three Days of the Condor in 1975, The Interpreter confirms a paranoiac's worst suspicions. It depicts a world of shadows, dangerous and unknowable. Things go on under cover of darkness, all of them bad. Knowledge can be fatal, and the same goes for ignorance. One person alone doesn't have much of a chance. The person alone, in this case, is Nicole Kidman as Silvia, a U.N. interpreter born in the fictional war-torn African nation of Matobo. Silvia accidentally overhears a conversation over an open microphone between two dissidents planning an assassination. She escapes from the building, but the assassins know who she is, and they know where she lives. So from that point on, not only is the African dictator, Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), in peril, but she is, too. The film keeps the tension simmering, focusing on both the personal and the political. It engenders a state of anxiety about what will happen in the larger world at the same time it keeps us anxious about what will become of Silvia. It also ropes us in by complicating Silvia's interaction with Keller, the Secret Service agent played by Penn. Penn is in charge of security for foreign dignitaries. He listens to Silvia's story about overhearing assassination plans and immediately writes her off as a phony. Even with just phoned-in performances, The Interpreter would have been a perfectly satisfying thriller -- the story is riveting enough on its own. So it's almost like a bonus to find Kidman and Penn bringing such thought and care to their roles here. They play opposites in type and temperament. He watches for a living, and she listens. He's instinctive, and she's methodical. He's forthright, and she's elliptical. But they have two things in common: a history of tragedy that has obliterated all faith that life is fair or sensible, and dignity in the face of that cold understanding. To see them in The Interpreter is to be struck by just how skillful and arresting these actors are. In close-up Kidman is radiant -- radiant with intelligence but also with a God-given, porcelain radiance that makes her, in some lights, look like a very wise 20-year-old. As for Penn, he does something that's rather difficult to adequately explain. He infuses his entire performance with sadness, but then doesn't play the sadness. He plays a guy just doing a job. If he were a house painter, you could say he makes sorrow the undercoat, and then covers it up, so that when you look, you see the surface, but the surface is informed by what's underneath it. But I'm afraid this is a clumsy description of something smooth and intuitive. One of the best scenes in the movie involves nothing dangerous, just Silvia and Keller, talking on their cell phones in the middle of the night. She is in her apartment, and he's in the next building watching over her. The actors find their way to that drawn-out rhythm that happens only in the wee hours, when there's no reason to get off the phone and no pressing reason to stay on, either, to let someone else's voice break the silence. It's a time for bonding, when people let their guard down. According to publicity, The Interpreter is the first motion picture ever filmed inside the United Nations, and the General Assembly auditorium, like most things in life, looks a little smaller than it does in the imagination. Previously, cameras have been banned, but the United Nations made an exception, and it picked a good movie to do that for. Though it would be fair to say that, in the end, Silvia makes a less gratifying heroine than either the Robert Redford character in Condor or the Tom Cruise character in The Firm, this is a suspense thriller of rare intelligence. -- Advisory: This film contains graphic violence.

"The Invasion: Thriller. Starring Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Jeffrey Wright and Jeremy Northam. Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)  The Invasion is the fourth version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and before seeing it, anyone should be excused for wondering, Does the world need another? The answer, strangely enough, is yes. Though, by now, pod people has become a catchphrase and the whole notion is almost a cliche, there is something about this story that speaks to the experience of life. When Nicole Kidman walks down a crowded street, expressionless and emotionless, pretending to be one of the aliens, we know what she's going through, because we've done it. Probably yesterday. Likewise, we know the dread of the hostile group, and we all know what it's like to look at people and realize they're not really there, that they haven't been there for a while.  The Invasion connects on a gut level in two ways, political and existential. In political terms, it's a metaphor for how all societies periodically go crazy, surrender their discernment for groupthink and behave in cruel ways. In existential terms, it's a frightening reminder of the true nature of life, which we frantically try to gloss over with everything we do, say and create: We're alone. The Invasion, like all versions of this tale, speaks to the human fear of utter and complete isolation.  But the movie doesn't coast on the work of previous versions. Screenwriter Dave Kajganich completely reimagines the story, including the nature of the pods. In The Invasion, the pods are an alien virus that comes to Earth when a space shuttle explodes upon re-entering the atmosphere. The pieces of the shuttle, spread out over miles, carry the virus, and soon, as more people come into contact with the fragments and with those whose blood has been infected, folks start acting weird: emotionless, placid and disengaged. The story shrewdly places the main characters where they need to be. Kidman is Carol, a psychiatrist, and so she's up on the behavioral changes. Her best friend, Ben (Daniel Craig), is a physician and medical researcher, so he's able to find out what's going on medically. And Carol's ex-husband (Jeremy Northam), who is one of the first to be infected, is at the Centers for Disease Control. Needless to say, having been infected, he does everything he can to spread the disease.  Like all cultists, the pod people are alarming not because they're happy being pod people but because they insist that everyone should become a pod person. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel fills the screen with frightening images of group madness. In one scene, our heroine tries to escape with her son and finds her car covered in a swarm of bodies - about 40 people trying to break in and convert them. At the same time, The Invasion adds a note of ambiguity about the nature of these aliens, which doesn't confuse the film but rather adds to its richness and complexity: The pod people live in a world of placidity and mutual harmony. If everyone were like them, there would be no war and violence - except against those people immune to the virus. In The Invasion, Kidman has to do a few things. She has to seem a worthy focus for our sympathetic interest. She has to become someone we'd not like to see become a pod. And she has to look scared out of her mind. All three things are a lot easier than playing Virginia Woolf, and she hits them out of the park. Kidman makes the case for flawed and emotional humanity by just standing there.  As the best friend, Craig shows that he's not turned into a James Bond pod, always a danger after a career-transforming role, and Jeffrey Wright as the researcher who figures out the nature of the virus, again demonstrates that he's one of the finest character actors around. It's hard to say what makes Wright so special or so interesting, except that, though the roles change, an impression of alert intelligence and integrity remain consistent. He doesn't call attention to himself, but then he doesn't need to. -- Advisory: Disturbing images and strong language.",1
"The Island: Science fiction/action drama. Starring Ewan McGregor and ScarlettJohansson. Directed by Michael Bay. (PG-13. 133 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The second way is the better way because it takes the movie on its own terms, and on its own terms, The Island is just fine. Yet appreciating it as a piece of propulsive entertainment -- lots of fun and all that -- doesn't preclude wishing that director Michael Bay had trusted the story enough to let it breathe a little. Between car chases and scenes of people hanging off the sides of skyscrapers, the movie actually raises some fascinating questions about science, morality and the nature of the soul -- questions with lots of contemporary relevance. It raises them, but doesn't linger on them, and so the balance is off: too much meat, not enough vegetables. Like all good science fiction movies, it takes place in the future, in this case about 15 years from now. From what we see at the beginning, the United States, it seems, has become a fascist state, in which people live in controlled sectors underground in order to avoid contact with the earth's surface, which is contaminated. Their health is monitored. Their diet is controlled. Labor is manual, and they're all forced to wear white jumpsuits. The sexes are kept separate, though they can see each other and occasionally wave or say hello. Meanwhile, all around them are security guards, though who empowers these guards, as well as how they fit within the societal structure, is not understood or even, really, questioned. But one citizen -- Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) -- is beginning to question everything. He is wondering about the meaning of his life, and he's having tantalizing dreams of being on the sea, on a yacht, even though he has never been on any kind of boat in his life. He is also having romantic fantasies about Jordan Two Delta, but then she's played by Scarlett Johansson, so that's only reasonable. Lincoln wants more out of life, and for some reason, that's considered threatening. In the early minutes of the movie there is much talk about a place called the island, a luxury paradise known as the only uncontaminated place on earth. Admission to the paradise is by lottery. Life inside the sector is, in effect, controlled by each person's hope of someday making it out. The plot information I've related here so far is stuff you would know within the first five or 10 minutes of The Island. No more needs to be said, though I'd be willing to bet that 90 percent of the reviews will give away the entire first hour of the story, so don't read them, unless you want to know. It's much better to watch the film wondering what's happening and having the nature of this future society gradually revealed. It's very clever. It would be nice to be able to say something more specific than very clever, but this is the rare case where the choice is between writing a better review or preserving the film experience. Though Johansson was lauded for her performance in Lost in Translation, her acting in The Island constitutes her first truly adult work. Yes, she spends half the movie running and some of the rest hanging from buildings -- and her director cares more about demolishing cars than about human interaction -- and yet The Island constitutes an advance for her. For the time since Manny and Lo, which she made as a child, she's listening to her fellow actors and reacting without any apparent consciousness of what her face happens to be doing. The cloud of adolescence is lifting, and she's able to be as spontaneous and inspired as she was at 11 years old. As for McGregor, it's just a pleasure to see him not doing a lukewarm imitation of Alec Guinness. The Island is a reminder of McGregor's roguish charm. Of course, to be talking about the acting in a movie like The Island might be to miss the point. The movie is more about how many things Michael Bay can smash up -- lots. That might not be a talent most people respect, but it gets through to people anyway, and here Bay does it exceptionally well. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and violence. ",1
"The Italian Job: Crime adventure. Starring Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton. Directed by F. Gary Gray. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Look at a film like The Matrix Reloaded, which tries to maintain an audience's attention with abrupt switches from lifelessness to crazy freneticism. Then compare it with the assurance of F. Gary Gray's direction in The Italian Job, which never loses the dramatic thread in the slow scenes and never loses control in the chases. While other movies offer the spectacle of excitement, The Italian Job offers the actual feeling of excitement, grounded in the audience's well-earned appreciation of the characters and their circumstances. The movie is based on a Michael Caine film of the same name from 1969, but the story has been changed. For one thing, the action has been moved, as the story begins, from Turin to Venice, an improvement by any measure. Donald Sutherland, as a career thief, is strolling in the Piazza San Marco and talking into a cell phone to his daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron). So in the first minutes we see a gorgeous plaza and a tousled Theron. The Italian Job is off to a promising start. Sutherland and his band of fellow thieves, led by a young master named Charlie (Mark Wahlberg), are in the process of bringing crime to this virtually crime-free city. What follows is a magnificent heist that, in another film, might have monopolized 100 minutes of screen time, but here takes up about 10. The guys want to steal a safe filled with $35 million in gold bricks from an apartment filled with armed, dangerous men who are sitting there watching a soccer game. How do they manage it? With most movies involving elaborate criminal schemes, one can sense the screenwriters helping to make sure the plans work, paving the way so that nothing goes wrong. But The Italian Job leaves the impression of screenwriters (Donna Powers and Wayne Powers) who thought up all the different ways their plan might fail -- and then threw those complications into the story and found their way around them. There's an extra level of thinking at work, and it makes for a richer story. If there are such things as good crooks, these are the men. They don't carry guns. They don't use violence. Sutherland floats along, sighing like a wistful philosopher, and Wahlberg is a sensitive young artist whose art just happens to be grand larceny. The movie's intention is to differentiate them from the group's bad seed, Steve (Edward Norton), who double-crosses the gang and leaves them for dead. The story of The Italian Job is not really the story of the Italian job, but of how the wronged thieves -- joined by Stella (Theron), an expert safecracker -- reunite to steal back their money from their very paranoid former friend. There's something about Norton -- even at his most despicable, he always sounds like the soul of reason. He'd make a great Iago, because he'd be very easy to believe. As Steve, he's a man of enormous greed who has no capacity to enjoy his wealth. He's really just contemptible, and yet there's something irrepressibly buoyant in his demeanor that allows us to understand how he sees himself, as one smart operator. Norton's shimmering confidence makes a nice contrast with Wahlberg, who represents the other pole in this movie's moral universe. Here as always, Wahlberg seems to be harboring some inner anguish. His confidence isn't reflexive. He's always wrestling with some inner doubt. Stella, unlike her fellows, is a criminal novice, and Theron and the filmmakers are wise to have her act like one. The rest of the merry band has been around the block, and the picture goes out of its way to make them lovable. Jason Statham as the driver; Mos Def as the explosives expert; and Seth Green as the computer whiz who claims to have invented Napster -- each brings presence and comic flair to his role. Merry bands have become a tired staple of recent action movies. The mere fact that this movie actually succeeds in making its merry band lovable puts The Italian Job into its own category. -- This film contains violence and some strong language. ",1
"The Lake House: Romance. Starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Directed by Alejandro Agresti. (PG. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) How does he react? With wonder at this supernatural occurrence? Does he ask how John Kerry made out? Does he want to know who won the fifth race at Pimlico? Does he ask for a stock tip? Or does he get altruistic and try to find out about, say, aviation disasters, so as to contact the future passengers and tell them to take the train? No, he greets this only as an opportunity to establish a correspondence with a nice woman. He thinks maybe he's found a girlfriend. Likewise Bullock. She plays a woman communicating with a man from two years earlier. Does she tell him to contact the Army Corps of Engineers about the levee situation in New Orleans? Does she instruct him to inform Kerry about the Swift Boat guys? Does she even do something fun, like Google her new pen pal and tell him everything he'll do over the next two years? No, she just floats around in a wistful cloud, hoping someday to meet him. This is not normal behavior and, in anything other than a movie, this would not be admirable. Emotionally balanced adults would not be so egocentric, or so fixated on romance to the exclusion of everything else. Yet, we accept this behavior from ostensibly normal adults in a movie romance, because the people stand for us. They're fantasy glorifications of the selfishness of new love. They give us two hours of license to care about nothing but the characters' emotional lives and, by extension, our own. The measure of this kind of movie is its seductiveness, not its logic, nor the ways in which it exploits the supernatural angle, and The Lake House is seductive. Bullock and Reeves are good together, and they're just as good not together, communicating across a gulf of time through letters. In fact, this is one of the few relationship movies of recent vintage in which the principal characters come to know each other in a relaxed way. They don't have to meet cute. They don't have to get into a big argument 20 minutes before the finish. Instead, the relationship stays in that good phase -- it's all courtship and longing -- and the drama comes not from fake conflict but from the challenge of this two-year distance. The Lake House depends on the charm and quirky intelligence of its lead actors. (Remember when Reeves used to seem stupid? That's a distant memory now.) It also, more than most romances, depends on the ability of the actors to project thoughtfulness and emotion in moments of isolation. Both are good at this. Bullock is so good at it that it's become a staple of her movies, the scene in which she returns home to a silent house and contemplates her life. David Auburn, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, wrote the original screenplay, which moves between two distinct time periods seamlessly, without ever becoming confusing. (Bullock has a different haircut for each year, which helps. I vote for the 2004 model.) If Auburn is responsible for the arresting concept, director Alejandro Agresti is responsible for creating the atmosphere that sustains it. It's a delicate, hyper-romantic atmosphere, pensive and steeped in longing, that covers over the story's inconsistencies -- or at least offers enough distraction to make us not care. -- Advisory: A violent car accident, adult situations.

"The Last Mistress: Drama. Starring Asia Argento, Fu'ad Ait Aattou and Roxane Mesquida. Directed by Catherine Breillat. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)You are not having sex. They are. That has always been the foundational principle of director Catherine Breillat's approach to sex scenes. There's nothing pretty about them. There's nothing seductive - no beautiful music, no perfect skin (without pores), no gauze, no soft-core-porn touches to incite envy or fantasy. It's all bone-white limbs under bright light, straining muscles and grunting, as erotic as a camcorder recording of your neighbors on three beers. Yet it all has a point, and that is to bypass the subjective and engage the objective eye. Breillat is not showing us Sex, some generic and idealized entity that exists only in the imagination. She is showing us two specific people and inviting us to look at their lust and desire, as well as all the social customs and attitudes surrounding them, with inquisitiveness, distance and understanding. She is inviting us to really look at sex as it occurs in life, and to engage with it mentally, as a driving mystery of human existence.  For her new film, The Last Mistress, the provocative Breillat (Sex Is Comedy, Fat Girl) finds her ideal muse in Asia Argento. Argento, an Italian actress who appears in European and American films, is not a great (or even an especially good) actress, but she's a great personality, utterly fearless and without vanity. Argento is flashy for the sheer joy of flashiness, and, like Breillat, she is generous and melodramatic in her impulses. If Breillat prefers vulgarity to subtlety, it's unclear whether Argento even knows the difference.  (This is not a put-down. If more actors were vulgar and less subtle, cinema would be more innocent and joyful. But that's a whole other discussion.) In The Last Mistress, set in 1835, Argento is Vellini, the 36-year-old lover of a young womanizer, Ryno (Fu'ad Ait Aattou). Vellini and Ryno have been together for 10 tempestuous years. He fights duels over her. She cuts his face with a knife, not out of anger, simply as a kind of love pat. They have lots of fun, but as the story begins, Ryno is engaged to marry a beautiful young woman, Hermangarde (Roxane Mesquida). It's the marriage of the century - this beautiful girl adores him, and she has loads of money, too - and so, of course, Ryno has to dump the old mistress. Argento's allure onscreen has always been half a matter of looks and half a matter of conviction, but this is a Breillat film, which means going through the movie with her hair plastered to her head and dressed as a kind of ostentatious Spanish parody, like Marlene Die- trich in The Devil Is a Woman. It means loving close-ups of her crooked front teeth and scenes of her smoking cigars. Everything is designed to present Argento not as an object of desire (as another movie would have), but as an object of his desire. This woman is his problem.  The approach creates distance, instead of identification, but distance brings a whole other set of possibilities. Moments are funny. Other moments are pathetic. We're invited to look at the situation clinically, to study the characters as archetypes and to sympathize with their predicament without making their problems our own. Gradually, we might recognize ourselves in them, but not in a self-satisfied way. The Last Mistress could have been subtitled The Curse of the Flesh. So could most of Breillat's films. Argento, of course, is in her element, everything Breillat must have dreamed of when she cast her. But from a directorial point of view, what's more impressive is the performance Breillat gets out of Fu'ad Ait Aattou, who, as Ryno, has the lead role. Attou had never acted in a film before, but he carries it off with nuance and specificity but also with a transparency of essence. A purity. He's totally open in a way that young actors rarely are - in a way that says everything about the director.  -- Advisory: Frontal nudity (female) and protracted sexual encounters.",1
"The Legend of Suriyothai: Historical drama. Starring M.L. Piyapas Bhirombhakdi. Directed by Chatri Chalerm Yukol. (R. 142 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Legend of Suriyothai can be seen as a crash course -- an opulent two hour and 22-minute epic that dramatizes 20 pivotal years in mid-16th century Thai history. It's more interesting than it sounds. Besides the sheer spectacle, which is notable -- colorful costumes, seduction rituals and enough elephants to supply a dozen circuses -- the movie offers a pageant of human behavior at its most hungry and scheming. There's sex, murder, political intrigue, conspiracies, shifting alliances and the occasional naked dancer just to make sure the audience is still awake. The audience is definitely awake. Writer-director Chatri Chalerm Yukol crams in all this history by using lots of helpful narration and by focusing on dramatic highlights. This translates into a winning strategy, a historical film that consists almost entirely of good parts, without any time wasted on tiresome exposition. Suriyothai starts the film as a spunky young princess who falls in love with a young soldier but who is persuaded -- not forced -- into marriage with a member of the royal family, a mild fellow, not too exciting, rather like Paris in Romeo and Juliet. They make a nice life, but political instability within the country and threats from without keep intruding on their peace. Most of the internal political problems are, entertainingly enough, the result of sex. The old king is a roue who takes a pretty young wife, has a son and dies. The king's wife's family, a collection of scoundrels, inherits the government, which leaves the country open to a potential attack from Burma. So what does a patriot do? A coup d'etat against the wishes of the late king? Or obedience to a corrupt regime? In another sex mess, a great warrior takes as his wife a former courtesan (mistake right there), who immediately starts cavorting with a court musician and plotting to seize the throne. The courtesan, Srisudachan (Mai Charoenpura) is in many ways the film's most fascinating character, a vicious nonentity, lusting for power -- even though she has power already. As the courtesan/queen, Charoenpura steals the picture, playing her as a sexy and single-minded idiot, without empathy or conscience, who is nonetheless appealing in the way a child is appealing. She wants what she wants and can't quite appreciate the consequences. Compared to Srisudachan, Suriyothai is a little on the dull side, a sidelines player for most of the movie. Yet the character remains for the audience a locus of sanity, sober and wise, radiant with good sense and ready to take action when necessary. It's a measure of the film's success that when it finally pits the forces of good versus the forces of evil, the battle becomes a matter of intense rooting interest. People who think they couldn't possibly become nerve racked over the fate of 16th-century Thailand are in for a surprise. ",1
"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou: Comedy-fantasy. Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Cate Blanchett. Directed by Wes Anderson. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, director Wes Anderson takes Murray -- an emissary from the land of prose -- and drops him into a poetic landscape. The Life Aquatic is a children's book of a movie, with the interior logic of a dream, full of vibrant colors and fantastic visuals. And in the midst of it, keeping all of it from flying away, is Murray, with his sad-sack, satiric face, playing an undersea documentarian going through a personal and professional crisis. It's almost a great movie. For half of its running time, Anderson maintains a distinct and arresting tone of vague absurdity, and then he loses control and the film begins to dip into silliness. Individual scenes become labored. Yet even at its worst, The Life Aquatic is always interesting -- there's really nothing else like it. Although its humor is shrewd and arch, the world of The Life Aquatic is so thoroughly imagined that it's hard not to feel on the receiving end of a generous act. It seems the product of a uniquely pure impulse. Murray plays Steve Zissou, a latter-day Jacques Cousteau, who premieres his latest undersea documentary at an Italian film festival. The audience is indifferent. He hasn't had a hit in years, and he's having difficulty raising money for his next project, a search for a leopard-spotted man-eating shark. Meanwhile, his marriage to a former heiress (Anjelica Huston) is falling apart, and a young man, Ned (Owen Wilson), who may be his son, has surfaced. Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums) renders Zissou's island compound in meticulous detail. Other directors provide just enough detail so that audiences will buy it. Anderson piles on details, so that the audience gets a complete sense of life as it's lived. There's a shot -- it probably doesn't last three seconds -- of Murray feeding fish to a whale in a tank. So Steve has a pet whale. In another shot, in which Murray is really doing nothing but walking into a room, there are birds flying around him. So birds have gotten loose. Are these details important? They're not necessary, but in a cumulative sense, yes, they are important. At the very least, to see a movie as textured as The Life Aquatic is to realize the thinness of the usual fare. The film is often quite funny, but there are no bits and no punch lines. Laughing at any point makes about equal sense. Sorry I didn't acknowledge your existence all those years, Steve tells the man who might be his son. It won't happen again. The low-key comic style lets the audience notice the absurdity, while allowing the actors to play the emotions straight. Thus Murray and Wilson are able to achieve a father-son poignancy in their interaction, even though most of their scenes are intentionally and faintly ridiculous. Murray's scenes with Cate Blanchett work similarly. She plays a virtual parody of a crusading journalist, a five-months-pregnant magazine writer interviewing Steve for a cover story, a prospect that fills him with hope and paranoia. Their conversations satirize the tortured dance of celebrities and reporters. Yet The Life Aquatic also takes us into the pain of a working woman, on her own, pregnant by a married lover. It was probably too much to expect the film to stay like this, hovering in a happy limbo, introducing and revealing characters. When the plot kicks in -- specifically when pirates show up -- The Life Aquatic goes off the rails and never completely recovers. Still, until the finish, there are white dolphins, and animated sea creatures, and Murray's face. There's always something to look at. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity, cartoonlike violence and sexual situations. ",1
"The Machinist: Psychological drama. Starring Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon. Directed by Brad Anderson. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) His appearance trumps every other consideration. It is the thing people will walk out talking about, and it's the thing that must be addressed first. Here's an actor who, in his normal incarnation, could be described as slender. Minus 63 pounds, he looks like something out of a concentration camp, with arms like sticks and a spine sticking out of his back like a vacuum cleaner hose. Easily, this is the skinniest performance in a feature film since Bette Davis' cadaverous turn in The Wicked Stepmother. Yet, if the weight loss sometimes takes us out of the film, it also works within it, never letting us fail to see Trevor as something apart from the people around him. Sharing the frame with Bale, as Trevor's prostitute girlfriend, Jennifer Jason Leigh looks so lush, so comfortably padded, so cozily encased in comfy flesh, that a viewer's eyes seize on her as something sane and lovely -- not as someone merely normal, but rather as an emissary from the land of the living. When Bale rests his head on her body, it's not just a relief for him but for us. The Machinist is a smart movie about a man who's cracking up. What differentiates it from other movies about mental illness is that it doesn't concern a man who was bound to go crazy all along. He is not Norman Bates. Instead, he's a fellow in the midst of an acute crisis, stemming from causes unknown, and something in Bale's performance makes this all quite clear. He lends Trevor a blithe manner and a sense of humor that suggests a fully socialized adult who just happens to be in a bad way. He can't sleep -- not at all, not for a year -- and he's obviously not eating. He's becoming paranoid and delusional. Other people have imaginary friends. He has an imaginary friend, too, but he doesn't even like the guy (John Sharian). That must be the ultimate in being both wiggy and hard-up for company: Hanging out with an imaginary friend one dislikes. All the while, Trevor tries to regain control, writing himself notes and posting them on the refrigerator. But reality is slipping farther and farther away. The mental illness is conveyed by director Brad Anderson and screenwriter Scott Kosar as a kind of bifurcation of reality. Trevor can function in the real world, but at any moment the abyss can reach out and claim him. In one scene, he's on a date with a waitress friend (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), talking in her living room. He gets up to walk down a corridor, and without the distraction of this friendly woman to keep his mind occupied, the thought of walking down a corridor suddenly feels threatening to him. He knows that if he's alone with his own mind, his mind will attack him. As the downtrodden, lowdown, sexy, trusting and quietly funny prostitute, Leigh is, of course, in her element. Sanchez-Gijon, a Spanish actress best known in America for her starring role in A Walk in the Clouds, provides a much-needed touch of sweetness -- for Trevor and for the movie. But mainly this is all Bale's show. He is strangely sympathetic, taking us right into Trevor's pain without any special pleading. To watch him is to feel it. It's also to want to buy him a double-whopper with cheese, fries and a chocolate shake. Advisory: This film contains violence, nudity, sexual situations and strong language. ",1
"The Magdalene Sisters: Drama. Starring Geraldine McEwan, Nora-Jane Noone, Dorothy Duffy and Anne-Marie Duff. Directed by Peter Mullan. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Apparently, throughout most of the 20th century, Irish girls who were considered sexually loose or even at risk for such behavior could be put into workhouses administered by the Magdalene Sisters. The girls were fed slop and forced to work in laundries for eight to 10 hours each day, seven days a week. Tens of thousands of girls suffered under these conditions, living under lock and key and with no rights, no freedom and no privacy. For some, the asylums were like the roach motel -- girls checked in, but they never checked out, except 40 or 50 years later, in a pine box. The Magdalene Sisters is an infuriating film to watch. The nuns, convinced of their own rectitude and fearful of their own impulses, treat the girls with unrelenting disdain and vindictiveness. The girls are whipped for speaking out of turn, and if a girl tries to escape, her head is shaved. Far from acting like Christians, the nuns act as though they're certain there is no God and, therefore, have no fear for their own salvation. The film follows the fortunes of three girls. Rose (Dorothy Duffy) is an unwed mother whose family has abandoned her and whose child has been taken away. Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) is an orphan, sent to the asylum just for being pretty. And Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is a rape victim who made the mistake of naming her attacker. .4 Director Peter Mullan conveys the aftermath of the rape in a sequence with no dialogue. As music plays at a wedding, various men, including Margaret's father, hear of her accusation. We see the men, watch the body language and recognize, without needing to hear their words, that the old boys are closing ranks. The attacker will go free, and the girl will be sacrificed. That's the story underneath the story in The Magdalene Sisters. Through the film, we encounter a culture, circa 1965, that reviles women and is intent on controlling their power by controlling their sexuality. It's a study in dysfunction: The lewd and sexually violent young men, the brutal, unforgiving fathers and the middle-aged women, mothers and nuns, who act as the system's henchwomen, are all children of the same lie -- that women and their bodies are inherently evil. At the center of the film is Geraldine McEwan as Sister Bridget, the commandant or Mother Superior of the asylum. In a complex performance of a shrewdly written role, McEwan plays the sister as a combination sadist, politician, hard-nosed realist and businesswoman. She is lonely because she's smarter than everybody around her, and she has a poetic streak. In one particularly strong scene, she tears up, watching Ingrid Bergman in The Bells of St. Mary's, her beatific face showing no understanding of how far from the Hollywood ideal her own life has fallen. One watches The Magdalene Sisters waiting, at first, for one of the girls to escape and tell her story to the newspapers. But we soon realize there are no newspapers to turn to. The girls are up against a monolith, in the grip of a church that holds sway over the government and over private institutions as well. All they have -- not much, but something -- is one another. ",1
"The Manchurian Candidate: Drama. Starring Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber andMeryl Streep. Directed by Jonathan Demme. R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) Based on the 1962 Cold War classic, directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Frank Sinatra, The Manchurian Candidate is updated to accommodate a whole new set of modern-day terrors and fantasies. Denzel Washington plays a man suffering from nightmares, but he's not the only one. The movie depicts a collective 21st century American nightmare, in which political, scientific and corporate power align to destroy the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- not by challenging them but by subverting them so utterly that no one even notices they're gone. The film is one of the few Hollywood movies to directly address the fact that we're living in a post-Sept. 11 world. It takes place either in some near- future or alternate present in which America is simultaneously involved in several wars, and terrorist attacks are common occurrences in American cities. An upcoming presidential campaign -- and a political party's need to seem tough on terrorism -- allows for the ascendancy of a young congressman, Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), a Gulf War veteran with a Medal of Honor to his credit. Engaging and forthright in public, he's strangely distracted in private and under the thumb of his ruthless mother (Meryl Streep), a powerful U.S. senator. Washington plays Ben Marco, a career soldier who remembers Shaw from the Gulf and recommended him for the Medal of Honor. Ever since, Marco has been plagued by recurring nightmares of being tortured and brainwashed in Kuwait. He dreams that Shaw's heroism never took place, that it was all a lie implanted in his head. The dreams seem real, but Marco tells himself he has Gulf War Syndrome and tries to ignore them. In a beautiful shot, we see Washington, as Marco, sitting in his crummy apartment, watching Shaw accept the vice presidential nomination. A lesser actor would glower or look mystified. Washington somehow does both. It's a look of concern, skepticism, aggrievement and puzzlement. He doesn't know what to think, but that's not stopping him from thinking. Meeting up with a veteran from his old unit, who is having identical nightmares, spurs Marco to start asking questions. That's really where the movie begins, and so let's leave the story there. Obviously, Shaw's heroism was a lie. Equally obvious is that powerful forces are behind placing him at the threshold of power. Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris set The Manchurian Candidate within a textured 21st century landscape, in which snatches of conversation, headlines and news snippets, overheard seemingly at random, create the impression of a mad, frenzied world. We hear about a controversy about touch-screen voting machines and later of an election in which the winning candidate has 70 percent of the vote. Coincidence? In the background of one scene, a comedian is on television, making jokes about the conglomerate Manchurian Global. The comedian thinks he's practicing his free speech, but he's as powerless and innocent as the schoolchildren we also see in passing, putting on a play about the Bill of Rights. In the original version of The Manchurian Candidate, the fear was communism. In the remake, it's tyranny in the form of Dwight Eisenhower's old fear, the military-industrial complex. In a deliberately provocative parallel, the movie treats Manchurian Global as a stand-in for Vice President Dick Cheney's former company, Halliburton. News reports talk about Manchurian being granted no-bid contracts and being accused of price gouging. Furthermore, like President Bush, Shaw is presented as a third-generation political figure, part of an American dynasty. Yet these parallels don't really add up to anything resembling a cohesive statement, and more than the first Manchurian Candidate, the remake shakes down as a conventionally plotted thriller. It's the performances that make it exceptional. As a man being driven half-mad, who can seem almost crazy in his drive to prove himself not crazy, Washington is the ideal locus of audience sympathy. As the candidate, Schreiber could be considered a villain, but he makes the character's confusion and horror come through. Even the minor players are made vivid -- not just Jon Voight as a liberal senator, but Vera Farmiga as the senator's daughter. But no one can talk about the acting in The Manchurian Candidate without rhapsodizing about Streep (in the role originated by Angela Lansbury). She has the Hillary hair and the Karen Hughes attack-dog energy, but the charm, the inspiration and the constant invention are her own. She gives us a senator who's a monomaniac, a mad mommy and master politician rolled into one, a woman firing on so many levels that no one can keep up -- someone who loves being evil as much as Streep loves acting. She's a pleasure to watch -- and to marvel at -- every second she's onscreen. -- Advisory: This movie contains violence and strong language. ",1
"The Nativity Story: Drama. Starring Keisha Castle-Hughes, Oscar Isaac and Shohreh Aghdashloo. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle discusses Nativity Story, Turistas and Dreamland.]What could have been an after-school special or some somber straight-to-video exercise becomes, in the hands of screenwriter Mike Rich and director Catherine Hardwicke, a gritty and affecting picture that takes the story of Jesus Christ's conception and birth and depicts it as it might have happened. Its hard edges and unabashed piety will remind some of The Passion of the Christ, but The Nativity Story has none of the neurosis or fetishism of the Mel Gibson film. It's also not a closed shop, catering to one specific vision of Christianity. It's a lovely thing aimed at everybody. Hardwicke is best known as the director of Thirteen, about two seventh-grade girls who descend into shoplifting, drug abuse and sexual experimentation. That might sound like the wrong resume for the director of The Nativity Story, but it's exactly right. Hardwicke is no sentimentalist. She is concerned with moral issues. And she has insight into teenagers. The Nativity Story is, after all, the story of a teenage girl who gets pregnant. Mary has nothing to do with it -- an angel tells her that she'll conceive through a visitation of the Holy Spirit -- but she has little hope that anyone in her community will believe her. Hardwicke and Rich do a number of very intelligent things. First, they take whatever is in the Bible and fortify it through research. So the Jewishness of Mary's village in Nazareth is emphasized, and so is Roman oppression in the form of cruel taxation. As in the Bible, there are shepherds, but they're not the shepherds that you see on Christmas cards. These are the real shepherds of history, terribly poor people, practically outcasts, who are filthy and lead lives of utter loneliness and poverty. On their way to Bethlehem, Mary and Joseph meet a shepherd, a scruffy, sweet guy who looks desperate to talk to somebody. A second smart thing Hardwicke and Rich do is take characters from history and then fill them out in imaginative ways that humanize them, explain their actions and yet don't detract from spiritual significance. Here the Three Wise Men are a fussy trio of devout scholars, specifically defined, each with his strengths and weaknesses. Elizabeth, a mature woman miraculously pregnant with the child who'll become John the Baptist, is a joyful and warm presence as played by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is just an average girl, but with a nice simplicity and purity. Joseph (Oscar Isaac) is the film's most impressive creation. In the Bible, he's almost a complete blank, a nice guy who is upstaged by God, the ultimate case of a fellow getting cut into on the dance floor and making the best of it. But here he's a tough guy with a strong, moral nature -- protective, feisty and capable, a real hero. One of the incidental points of the film, particularly powerful, is that doing the right thing isn't easy, even in the face of divine assurance. Angels may show up, but if they show up in dreams, you have a choice whether to believe them. Even when the instruction is explicit, it's not as though heavenly signs are showering in every day. Mostly it's silence and people left to their own devices. So, what does Joseph say to Mary on the journey? He says, I wonder if I'll be able to teach him anything. Basically, they're two people, improvising, trying to do right. By grounding everything that went before in an earthy realism, Hardwicke earns the elevation of the nativity sequence, one of the more beautiful scenes in this year's cinema. It's the same crew you'll find under any Christmas tree -- the holy family, the shepherds, the wise men -- all very human and bathed in starlight. -- Advisory: There is some violence, but this is essentially a family film.

"The Notorious Bettie Page: Drama. Starring Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor. Directed by Mary Harron. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Many years ago, producer Irving Thalberg told the fledgling actress Myrna Loy that there was something holding her back, a veil between her and her audience that she needed to break through. Until this film, I think there was a similar veil, an intelligent person's wariness, between Mol and her audience. But something about playing the role of someone who was, in turn, also playing a role -- that of a flirt and an extrovert -- has overcome whatever hint of embarrassment she might have at being an actress. This role has unlocked her, and from here if on Mol doesn't get her due as a thoughtful and warm talent, something is very wrong. The chief contribution of director Mary Harron and her co-screenwriter, Guinevere Turner, is that they don't get in Mol's way. They provide contexts for her to play to the onscreen camera (and to us, as well). They know what they have. They also do something curious, which for some reason actually works to the movie's advantage. They tell Page's story in a curiously uninflected way, revealing little, if any, point of view, and imposing no meaning or particular importance on this woman's life. This approach is far from a recipe for high drama, but it has the integrity of accuracy. The audience is introduced to Bettie because the audience is perhaps interested in Bettie or her career or her era. But there's no pretending that her life was all that fascinating, or that her contribution to culture was significant, or that her story contains a lesson worth receiving. There's no real tragedy, and the only triumph is the movie itself, the historical accident of being remembered. It's nothing she did. She just stood there and posed. The Notorious Bettie Page is about the mundane but living humanity behind the pictures, the regular person behind a decade's fantasies. The world of '50s proto-porn might look quaint to us today, but the ultimate triumph of Harron's approach is that one could just as easily come away more disturbed by it than amused. Bettie is a Tennessee teenager from a religious background who gets married to a man who hits her. Later, her trusting nature leads her to be gang-raped; whereupon, she goes to New York to become an actress. She ends up posing for skin magazines, and the closest she gets to acting are her roles in bondage fetish shorts, in which she wears a corset and is tied up and gagged. It's up to the audience to decide if this career move represents an overcoming of her circumstances or one more station in her degradation and objectification. As played by Mol, Bettie is unusually gifted in front of a camera, able to throw off her inhibitions and fling her personality through the lens, and yet she's agreeable and passive in her daily life, lacking the will or wherewithal to stand back and look at what she's doing. The movie omits any mention of a salary for Bettie, but it doesn't take much to figure out that the photographers, including her friends Irving and Paula Klaw (Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor), are making more money than she is. The Notorious Bettie Page can be seen as a virtual study in what happens to a pretty woman, circa 1950, who keeps doing whatever people ask her to do. It's about one strange route to fame. The picture takes place in two worlds -- the world of Christian fundamentalism, from which Bettie came, and the proto-porn world represented by the Klaws. Harron doesn't really understand the first world, and she goes a little easy on the second world. The bondage pictures of the real Bettie Page, available on the Internet, are creepier than you'd expect from watching the movie, and Page herself looks considerably more hardened than the fresh-faced Mol. Yet Harron maintains the movie's essential neutrality, leaving The Notorious Bettie Page open to a variety of interpretations. Was this a triumphant life or an unrealized one? Was Bettie's talent thwarted or realized by her modeling? Was Bettie's ultimate conversion back to evangelical Christianity the case of a person finding herself? Or an example of an exploitation victim finding solace in yet another patriarchy, albeit a benign one? Or was this just the waste of a good model? There's enough here for a good after-movie argument, and that's more than can be said for most pictures. -- Advisory: Full frontal nudity (female), sexual situations. ",1
"The Octave Mirbeau novel “Diary of a Chambermaid” has been adapted for several films, most notably Luis Buñuel’s 1964 classic, starring Jeanne Moreau. There would seem to be no room for a new version, but director Benoit Jacquot makes a persuasive case for a return to the story, with a scowling, watchful Lea Seydoux in the role of a scheming chambermaid.Jacquot is a colder filmmaker than Buñuel, not given to comic absurdity, and he doesn’t wear his politics on his sleeve. He returns the film to its original time period, circa 1900 (Buñuel placed it in the early 1930s, to coincide with the rise of fascism), and he concerns himself less with the culture of a society than with the predicament of a woman, specifically one of obvious intelligence and spirit, consigned to a life of virtual slavery. The political is implicit, but the injustice — the entrapment — is what we feel.Seydoux is a professional chambermaid who has already worked as a servant for several Parisian families, some kindly and some wicked, when she takes a job working in the provinces for a middle-aged couple. The husband (Herve Pierre) is a pathetic lecher who can’t keep his hands off of her, and the wife (Clotilde Mollet) is mean and lazy. The most interesting person in the household is Joseph, who takes care of the animals and the grounds. Joseph (Vincent Lindon) says nothing, sees everything, and he has secrets.“Diary of a Chambermaid” is not a film with strong forward motion. Like so many of Jacquot’s films, whether it’s “Farewell My Queen” (2012) or “À Tout de Suite” (2004) or “A Single Girl” (1995), it’s about a woman on her own, trying to survive in a particularly challenging, and even dangerous, social milieu.The filmmaker’s intensity of interest in the specific circumstances of woman’s survival, combined with a directorial affect that is the farthest thing from sentimental (or even emotional), brings the viewer into this woman’s world. This is a confident filmmaker who knows that if he just shows us her experience, day by day, without comment, we will be searching for her escape long before she even starts looking.And this is what Jacquot does. He simply has us follow her, as in a diary, as she maintains her arrogant sense of self against a barrage of indignities and petty tyrannies. Viewers will inevitably think of how they themselves might see the world, were their world limited to the things that the chambermaid sees — a world in which money is everything, and cruelty is everywhere. In one particularly odd and haunting scene, she visits the property next door and has a brief conversation with the master of the house, a brisk, lively fellow that we soon realize is a sadist and possibly a psychopath.Of course, everything she sees, Joseph has seen, only he has seen it longer, over the course of 40 years of servitude. In retrospect, the political implications of Jacquot’s “Diary of a Chambermaid” couldn’t be more clear. The chambermaid and Joseph, in their limited way, perceive a specific set of problems that have societal implications, and the solutions they gravitate toward, if extrapolated to an entire class, would have bleak consequences. But it’s a strength, not a weakness, of Jacquot’s that he makes movies about people. The ideas can take care of themselves.",1
"The Orphanage: Horror thriller. Starring Belén Rueda, Fernando Cayo, Géraldine Chaplin and Roger Príncep. Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona. (R. 110 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) Agnosticism has killed the horror genre in the United States. Take away the afterlife, take away a belief in the spirit world, and horror becomes about nothing but the fear of death and stories about sadism. Add in those ingredients, and horror can return to its real subject - the line between the seen and unseen, where the living meet the dead and the mysteries of life are revealed. Until we figure that out, we may have to keep importing our horror, and if that means more movies like The Orphanage, all the better. Spain's official entry into this year's Academy Awards takes modern techniques and a glossy, modern style and matches them with traditional horror concerns, such as life on the other side. Beautifully conceived and composed, it's eerie, sometimes frightening and surprisingly moving. The Orphanage is the first feature of Juan Antonio Bayona, who has previously made music videos and short films, and from the first moments, this director's ability to incite emotion becomes apparent. He shows a girl of about 11 playing outside. Then, as we've registered that, the camera pulls back, and we see that she's playing with a group of girls who are all wearing the same gray uniform. We realize that we're looking at an orphanage - and just as that knowledge has made itself felt, the first lines of dialogue tell us that this girl, Laura, has been adopted and is about to be separated from these friends. Ninety seconds into the movie, and the audience already has an emotional investment. That's the prologue, and from there the film jumps ahead about a quarter century to the present day, where we find Laura (Belén Rueda) as a level-headed, no-nonsense 37-year-old woman with an altruistic plan. She, her husband and adopted son have moved into the orphanage, long since abandoned, with the intention of reviving it. As the adult Laura, Rueda is complex and instantly appealing, a woman with a tough surface and tender reactions. Her interplay with young Roger Príncep, who plays her son, Simón, has layers of history and feeling. Rueda's emotional life holds the film together, though one example of many superb moments will have to suffice here. Simón is HIV-positive but doesn't know it, and at one point he announces to her, with the force of revelation, that he won't get old. Just a flicker of panic, concern and heartache crosses Rueda's face, until she realizes that Simón simply means that he wants to be like Peter Pan. This is full, rich acting, not at all flashy but completely present. Simón has an elaborate fantasy life, or so his parents think. He keeps telling them about imaginary friends, and his circle of imaginary friends keeps expanding. It's only later that Mom begins to catch on that maybe those imaginary friends aren't imaginary, just unseen. Just who they are and what they want make up the story of the movie. The casting of the minor and featured roles was done with an eye for visual impact, a trick that Hitchcock demonstrated long ago. An expert on the paranormal (Edgar Vivar) turns out to be enormously fat, and a woman claiming to be social worker is a bug-eyed old lady (Montserrat Carulla), with a face that looks like a wrinkled sack. At one point, Laura hires a medium, who is played by none other than Géraldine Chaplin, one of the more eccentric-looking actresses, who speaks Spanish with the snap and gusto of someone who had to learn it. Though the movie has a handful of shots that are downright gross to witness, what makes The Orphanage scary is not what it threatens to show but what it suggests about life. Already with his first feature, Bayona not only has visual grace and an elegant compositional sense, but an almost unconscious understanding of which shot to use in order to create the proper mood and emotion. This ability has nothing to do with logic and little to do with linear thinking. It's more along the lines of having a feel for the task. Bayona has it, and he's made an exceptional first feature. -- Advisory: Ugly, frightening shots and subject matter that will disturb children.",1
"The Other Boleyn Girl: Drama. Starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana. Directed by Justin Chadwick. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's probably a safe bet that The Other Boleyn Girl won't be getting too many raves, simply because it's so easy to mock. Even if you enjoy it, there's a tendency to look back on the experience with some sardonic distance and think of it as a modern soap opera with Elizabethan trappings. The movie has only a casual relationship with historical reality and gets lots of the details wrong, including the fact that Henry VIII looked a lot more like Charles Laughton than Eric Bana. Yet, however embarrassed you might feel in the morning, this in an enjoyable movie with an entertaining angle on a hard-to-resist period of history. There are two pretty sisters, and by the end, one is going to have her head chopped off. There's power, manipulation, maneuvering, sexual exploitation and a king (Bana) whose notion of seduction is to go up to a woman and say, Tonight. (That's it, just tonight.) Also worth noting are some genuinely interesting takes on historical figures, including Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), who in most movies is treated like an austere fanatic. Here she's presented as an attractive woman of unmistakable integrity who knows she is about to get the shaft. The film pairs Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman as sisters, with each getting to play against her usual casting. The normally knowing Johansson is the doe-eyed Mary Boleyn, who goes through life just trying to mind her own business. And the normally straightforward Portman is her scheming sister Anne, who is probably the smartest person in the movie, but intelligence and a weak hand won't win many card games. Portman's performance, which shows a range and depth unlike anything she's done before, is the No. 1 element that tips The Other Boleyn Girl in the direction of a recommendation. Yet at least grudging acknowledgment must also be made of the arresting appeal built into the story's design. Based on Philippa Gregory's novel, the film invites viewers to witness one of history's great train wrecks in slow motion, from the standpoint of someone who had a seat in the front car. Perhaps some people might lose interest once Henry starts nosing around the Boleyn girls, but those are probably the same good people who could stop watching 10 seconds into the Zapruder film. For most of us, the spectacle of disaster is just too compelling to look away. The fun starts when Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance), an ambitious wannabe who has married into a prominent family, gets a great idea about how to advance his wealth and standing: He will have his daughter, Anne, become mistress to the (married) king of England. Peter Morgan (The Queen), who wrote the screenplay, emphasizes the drama and the immorality of such a scheme, thus making us tangibly aware of the skewed nature of Henry's whole circle. That a father could do such a thing to his daughter - and that a daughter could cooperate, in the reasonable belief that she's advancing her own interests - tells us all we need to know about this alien time and place. But Henry screws up Mr. Boleyn's plans. He's not attracted, at least not at first, to smart-mouthed Anne. He takes a liking, instead, to the gentle and newly married Mary, who has no choice but to show up in his bedchamber at the appointed hour. This is what Mel Brooks was talking about when he said it's good to be the king, but here it's not bad to be the mistress, either. Like she does everything, Mary stumbles into the situation passively and willingly, with her eyes glazed and her mouth half-open. Johansson is not at her best playing women less shrewd than herself, but by emphasizing Mary's goodness instead of her naivete she finds a way to a performance that's proficient and affecting. The acting laurels, however, belong to Portman, who won't get the credit she deserves for this, simply because the movie isn't substantial enough to warrant proper attention. But she certainly goes on a journey in this film, from youthful confidence, to jaded spitefulness, to absolute shrieking panic. She has one of her best scenes ever in the moments following Anne's delivery of a daughter, the child who'd become Elizabeth I.  No actor can play two things at once. Actors can only experience two things simultaneously and let the camera record it. In the childbirth scene, it's a near calamity for Anne that the child is a girl - and yet this is her baby, and she has just given birth. Portman gives us all of that at once, an Anne who is both mother and politician, human being and monster. Mainly, we see that she's just a young woman who has gotten in way, way over her head. -- Advisory: Sexual situations and sex talk.",1
"The Prince & Me: Romantic comedy. Starring Julia Stiles and Luke Mably. Directed by Martha Coolidge. (PG. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The simple act of telling the story through the woman's eyes changes the nature of the tale in interesting ways, and for the most part, the update is honest and illuminating. The casting of Julia Stiles as a brainy college student, working part time as a barmaid and with ambitions to become a doctor, is a big plus. Stiles seems just as smart and single-minded as the woman she plays. And Luke Mably is every American's picture of a young prince. With his broad shoulders and gangly body, he looks like one of those sandy-haired, small-headed Windsor boys. But probably the best thing about The Prince & Me is the way the story doesn't end in the obvious place but keeps going, showing the characters continuing to develop. Unlike most Hollywood movies, especially one aimed at young people, it tells its story in four movements, not the usual three. The only bad thing is that when it finally does find its way to a satisfying conclusion, it doesn't stop there, either, but tags on a little epilogue that lends a note of absurdity and compromise to its intended message. Still, teenage girls will probably find a lot of enjoyment and encouragement in this story. Stiles is Paige, a pre-med student who grew up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin, and Mably is Edward, the Crown Prince of Denmark. Edward decides to spend a year going to college in Wisconsin, after seeing one of those videos of drunken American college girls taking off their shirts for the camera. Accordingly, when he meets Paige at the local pub, he asks, Will you take your top off for me? and she squirts him with a seltzer gun. Edward's immediate and exclusive interest in Paige is never accounted for, just something the audience has to accept. Though he went to Wisconsin looking for adventure with a certain kind of American girl, his focus narrows to Paige, who's the complete opposite of a bar bimbo. He arranges his schedule around hers and becomes her lab partner in her organic chemistry class. For the first time in his life, he sets about winning the admiration of a woman who has no idea he's a prince. He seems to lose his heart to her completely one night, when he sees her dance to the jukebox as she cleans off tables. Considering how Stiles dances, it must be love, indeed, because even director Martha Coolidge's careful cutting can't disguise the fact that Stiles has all the natural rhythm of Peter Boyle in Young Frankenstein. The Prince & Me is as pleasant to watch as a fairy tale, but it's smarter than a fairy tale. When the story shifts to the royal court in Copenhagen, we see it all through Paige's eyes. At first it's awe-inspiring, and then it's just reality, a mixture of the glorious and the monotonous. The film is realistic about the demands of royalty and the fact that, in a royal context, being a genial, galumphing American isn't always enough, that individualism in a royal can be seen as a form of insolence, or at the very least, childish self-indulgence. The script doesn't ever tell us how we should feel about the royal life, but we get the idea when Coolidge indulges in a little fun, re-creating a set- up from The Godfather. Paige is shown looking from outside into a dark room, where her man is engaged is some business conference of which she knows nothing -- and then the door closes on her. -- Advisory: A fairly chaste film, with only one scene of lust that's interrupted before anything happens.

Drama. Starring Matt Damon, Frances McDormand, John Krasinski and Rosemarie DeWitt. Directed by Gus Van Sant. (R. 120 minutes.) Promised Land is a fine place to start appreciating Matt Damon, who always makes it seem as if everybody else is acting and he's just going through the movie being natural. Damon is the actor who leaves no fingerprints, who never calls attention to himself and never, ever screws up, not once in 20 years. Whether playing Jason Bourne or Mr. Ripley, Damon creates an illusion of the familiar, and that familiarity is put to good use in Promised Land, in which he plays a salesman for a fracking company, trying to talk rural people into leasing their land for natural-gas drilling. He is paired with a fellow salesperson, played by Frances McDormand, who also radiates informality and trustworthiness. Once the contracts are signed, the natural-gas company will come in and everyone will get rich - maybe. Or maybe their livestock will die and flames will come shooting out of the water faucets. Damon and McDormand play nice people with high-pressure jobs and roots in the land they're striving to transform. The question of the movie, a question they themselves must ultimately face, is whether they're helping a farm culture survive or acting as the means of its extinction.  Promised Land is directed by Gus Van Sant, with attention to the performances and real feeling for the environments that rural people inhabit - the open spaces, the quiet, and the tiny downtown with one store that sells everything and one bar where everyone congregates. Even if you've lived in a city your whole life, it's a world that feels like America. Yet despite the high spirits and the proud talk of the residents, it's a culture on life support, with farms undercut by big agriculture, unable to survive without government help. So to some of the residents, fracking looks like the miracle they've been waiting for. In an early scene, Damon sits in a living room and tells someone about the payoff from fracking. You'd be a millionaire. He says it with enough simplicity that it seems true and with enough force that the thought moves from the screen and fills the theater. Imagine someone - someone you instinctively trust and believe - telling you that if you sign something you will become a millionaire. And if you don't sign? The people on either side of you will become millionaires, but your kids won't be able to go to college. Written by Damon and John Krasinski, who plays an environmentalist (from a story by Dave Eggers), Promised Land is a measured, careful movie that doesn't raise its voice and make broad claims, but quietly expresses concerns. One concern, irrespective of the merits or dangers of fracking, is that the rural communities are no match for the natural-gas companies, with assets in the billions, and so their chance of getting unbiased, unfiltered information is doubtful. Thus, the film serves as a modest balance against that state of affairs, as well as a record of the moment in time when these decisions were being made. It's curious to consider how this very topical film will be regarded in 20 years. Promised Land plays out as a kind of campaign between Damon and McDormand on one side and Krasinski on the other, as the folksy environmentalist who rides into town and makes everyone love him. Damon is in his element here, playing someone trying to work things out in his mind, forced into introspection, while feeling pressured on all sides.  In addition to Krasinski and McDormand, who offer playful support, the movie gets boosts from Hal Holbrook, as the town's wise man, and Rosemarie DeWitt, who has never been so appealing - it's a dangerous charm to be able turn it on like that. But in the end this is Damon's movie, in that he's the moral locus, the film's center of meaning. It's about time to consider the possibility that Damon's appearing in so many good movies is no coincidence, that he's a big part of what makes them good.",1
"The Puffy Chair: Comedy-drama. Starring Mark Duplass, Kathryn Aselton and Rhett Wilkins. Directed by Jay Duplass. (R. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) But The Puffy Chair is better than that. Though the characters are aimless, this movie is going somewhere at all times. In every scene, at practically every moment, the screenplay lays down track toward the final minutes, and the fact that it never seems that way is all to the better. Under the cover of what seems like a charmingly slapdash style, the Duplass brothers have created a disarmingly shrewd movie. A man and a woman in their 20s are having an intimate dinner as the film opens. Director Jay Duplass brings us right into the scene, using handheld camera and tight close-ups that create a documentary feel. It helps that the actors seem completely natural. Josh (Mark Duplass) is about to go on a trip to buy a puffy chair, and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) wishes she could come along. Beneath the casual banter, there is tension in the relationship, and it comes to the surface. Josh relents and brings her with him and then, to her disappointment, allows his younger brother, Rhett (Rhett Wilkins) to accompany them as well. Rhett is an obnoxious poseur, a fake hippie whose New Age banter is mask for unrealized hostility, opportunism and selfishness. This further sours the road trip. There's one scene that encapsulates everything that's exceptional about The Puffy Chair. Along the road, Rhett has met a woman (Julie Fischer) and after a whirlwind courtship of about five hours, the two decide to get married. In the midst of a night of drinking, the engaged couple asks Josh to perform a pretend wedding ceremony, and he makes up vows for them off the top of his head. The mock wedding is charged for a number of reasons, including that Emily wants Josh to marry her. Watch Aselton in this scene, and then remember her in this moment later, after the film is over. She's extraordinary, playing several things at once: a reflexive sentimentality at the spectacle of a wedding, a longing to be married, and a perception (visibly at war with her hopes) that Josh's conception of marriage is immature and inadequate. For the Duplass brothers and Aselton, The Puffy Chair looks like the beginning of fine careers. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and sex banter. ",1
"The Pursuit of Happyness: Starring Will Smith, Thandie Newton and Jaden Christopher Syre Smith. Directed by Gabriele Muccino. (PG-13. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle on 'Happyness,' 'Dreamgirls.']The great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me. But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted onscreen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real. Gabriele Muccino (L'Ultimo Bacio) directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise. As in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that The Pursuit of Happyness is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad. In fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away. Having proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, The Pursuit of Happyness puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat. Will Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror. -- Advisory: This movie contains strong language.

"The Savages: Comedy-drama. Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Laura Linney and Philip Bosco. Directed by Tamara Jenkins. (R. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Tamara Jenkins has made a movie about something that lots of people are going through but nobody wants to deal with, not even in life, much less in entertainment. And she's done it fearlessly, with the right mix of humor and horror and with not even a shred of sentimentality.  The Savages is about young middle-aged adults dealing with an elderly parent who is losing his mind and can no longer take care of himself. It is, in a sense, a comedy about having a father who is smearing his feces on the wall, but to say that doesn't quite convey the tone that Jenkins finds here. The movie is not a farce. Farce would be easy - the audience would be invited to turn off its emotions and view the situation as spectacle. Rather, Jenkins grounds The Savages in reality, a brutal, absolute reality that's funny-awful enough to make farce look like an evasion and straight drama look like compromise. The characters' situation reflects the fragmented nature of families today. A brother (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a sister (Laura Linney) live far away from each other on the East Coast, and their father (Philip Bosco) lives on the other side of the country, in Arizona. But when there's a crisis, the kids have to drop what they're doing (somewhat grudgingly) and fly out there, where they learn the distinctions between assisted-living facilities and nursing homes. Suddenly, they have to figure out where the old man should live. Movies about adult siblings are rare, and even when we see them, they're usually about same-sex siblings working out, in adulthood, the competitive stresses of their childhood. The Savages deals with a brother-and-sister relationship, and it gets the details right - the ease of that interaction, the unspoken bond and the complete willingness of both parties to be rude to the other because they know the sibling can't be fooled anyway. Hoffman and Linney suggest a complete history in their conversation and even in their body language. They don't look alike, but they seem like brother and sister. There's only one false element, a tiny one. We're told that Wendy Savage (Linney) is three years younger than Jon Savage (Hoffman). In fact, Linney is three years older than Hoffman, but moreover - and this is the important thing - everything about Linney screams older sister, and in The Savages she treats him like a younger brother, pushing him, cajoling him, abusing him, remembering painful details of his childhood and fretting about everything. And he responds like a younger brother - by ignoring her or mumbling vague replies, and by not being fazed.  Both siblings are involved in theater, but from different angles. Wendy is an unproduced playwright who keeps applying for Guggenheim Fellowships, and Jon has a doctorate in theater studies, teaches in a university and is writing a book on Bertolt Brecht. These are not the arbitrary career designations sometimes found in movies, in which every nice guy is an architect. The protagonists in The Savages had unwelcome drama in their childhood, thanks to an angry and difficult father, and each has chosen a different way of dealing with it. Wendy has chosen to dive into the drama by writing about it, and Jon has chosen to analyze the phenomenon of drama itself and to study an artist whose whole career was founded on the deconstruction of dramatic techniques. Hoffman and Linney are superb, but as the film mainly follows Wendy, it's Linney who has the opportunity to give the standout performance, and she does. She's full throttle and energetic, knows exactly what she's doing at every moment, and she's funny - very funny. As the father, Bosco plays a shell of a man. There's a flash of life every so often, but there's little sense of what he might have been like when well. It's a tribute to writer-director Jenkins' restraint that she never tries to milk the father's situation for an emotional tug. It's a mildly comic motif in The Savages that whenever someone has a television on, the scene onscreen is frantic and emphatic, while the scene in the room is quiet and ambiguous. Jenkins is telling us that, in this movie, she's endeavoring to show life as it's lived on our side of the TV screen. She does.-- Advisory: This film contains strong language.",1
"The Sentinel: Drama. Starring Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland, Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger. Directed by Clark Johnson. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Douglas has been taking it for a long time, and sometimes dishing it out, and in The Sentinel he has his best showcase since Traffic six years ago. A well-constructed and genuinely tense thriller, The Sentinel, based on the novel by Gerald Petievich, takes audiences into an endlessly fascinating environment -- life in and around the White House -- and presents it from the privileged vantage point of a Secret Service agent. This vantage point is reinforced stylistically by the camera work, which subtly lets us into the consciousness of someone always scanning the scene for possible dangers. The Sentinel is the second feature from Clark Johnson, a TV director whose previous film was the disastrous S.W.A.T. His new effort is shot in the current thriller style, with a camera almost always in motion. But the movement here is graceful, not jarring, and Johnson steers clear of the handheld, shaky-camera indulgences that mar other pictures. In fact, style aside, there's almost something classic in this picture's vibe, that of an edgy crime movie from the 1970s, with its sudden violence, air of pessimism and flawed but stalwart hero. Douglas plays Garrison, a veteran Secret Service agent who was shot in the 1981 attempt on President Reagan. Two and a half decades later, he has a somewhat softer job as part of the detail protecting the first lady (Kim Basinger). But he's not only protecting her -- he's having an affair with her. Even worse, they're in love. This opens up possibilities for all kinds of complications, beyond the main action around which the story turns: There are people plotting to kill the president, and their information seems to be coming directly from the Secret Service. In other words, there's a traitor in the agency, and he or she is somewhere in the White House. If The Sentinel has a weakness, it's that we never quite find out why these people are so intent on killing the president, and though all reasons of this kind could conceivably be reduced to They're nuts, the lack of a specific motive robs the movie of some texture and, to that degree, makes the plot seem like a mere exercise. But this is something felt only in retrospect. As the movie unfolds, the conspiracy and everything surrounding it is shrouded in mystery. In the experience of The Sentinel, what the audience feels is mainly dread, anxiety and excitement. The logistical feat required in driving the president and first lady across town is daunting, and once The Sentinel takes us through that process, step by step, it's hard not to look at any cheering crowd as some ravenous organism and all faces in crowds as threatening. Bad enough that things could go wrong, but the worrying and anticipation would in itself be mentally exhausting, and that's how Douglas looks at the beginning of the picture. He looks even more harried, but galvanized, when the agency wrongly concludes that he is the traitor. Of course, that means only one thing: With his own agency on his tail, he has to solve and foil the conspiracy before he's thrown in jail. Kiefer Sutherland has the role of the chief investigator in pursuit, a former friend who now hates our hero's guts, for personal reasons, and can't wait to put him away. If he smiles once in the movie, I missed it. It's a nice portrait of a grim, by the book investigator who thinks he's all business but whose motives are more complicated. Eva Longoria plays his assistant, probably because the screenwriters figured he needed to talk to somebody and the movie needed a pretty girl. She's competent in a relatively bland role. As the president, David Rasche doesn't get to do much other than wear a suit and duck, and it's difficult not to look like a simp when you're the only unarmed person in a shootout. We know nothing about him other than that his wife is cheating on him and that he's probably a Democrat. Without explicitly saying so, the movie raises the intriguing question of whether it would be politically worse for a president to be a philanderer or a cuckold. There's a strong case to be made for either position. -- Advisory: This film contains violence. ",1
"The Sisters: Drama. Starring Maria Bello, Erika Christensen and Mary Stuart Masterson. Directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman. (R. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That's not exactly Chekhov. That's Richard Alfieri, who adapted his play for the screen. What Alfieri takes from Chekhov are the characters, their names and the basic situation. He also takes license to adopt a heightened theatricality, supported in Arthur Allan Seidelman's direction, in which the characters don't talk like people but like characters in a play. Viewers who don't realize this is intentional will be annoyed by the artificiality of the device, but it serves several functions, reminding us of the separateness of this family and their world, and the timelessness of the story. It takes place in a faculty study area of a New York City university, where elder sister Olga (Mary Stuart Masterson) and middle sister Marcia (Maria Bello) are preparing a surprise party for baby sister Irene (Erika Christensen). There for the party are Sokol (Eric McCormack), a compulsive cynic, and David (Chris O'Donnell), an earnest young man, both vying for Irene's attention, as well as a jolly old professor (Rip Torn), whose function in the story is to serve as referee and witness. On the surface, the women are part of an accomplished family and represent all there is to aspire to in terms of learning and civilization, but inside they're roiling with unreleased emotion. Olga is a lesbian, but completely closeted and trying to shut down that aspect of her nature. Irene is in the midst of life-threatening turmoil. And Marcia, the most vivacious, is also the most neurotic and promiscuous. It sometimes works in families that one person takes on the neuroses of all. That's Marcia, which means that Bello has the juiciest role. Marcia is most able to intuit the emotional constraints around her and does her best to break free of them -- with insults, rudeness and ugly behavior. Yet more than any of them, Marcia is boxed in by the family compulsion to overanalyze feelings right out of existence and to question the sincerity of any expression of sensitivity or kindness. This leaves Marcia with only one way to stop doubting and start feeling, and that's to place herself in emotionally shattering situations -- in other words, to obliterate herself beyond her capacity to think at all. An opportunity for emotional shattering presents itself in the form of Vincent (Tony Goldwyn), an old friend who shows up, handsome and unhappily married. Marcia is intrigued and then enthralled once she realizes that he's not put off by her emotional violence but seems to understand her. Bello brings out the full range of the role -- the sadism, the vulnerability, the self-disgust, the playfulness -- by finding the linchpin in Marcia's character, a frustrated longing. By tapping into that current, and having it underlie everything else, Bello takes a seemingly erratic character and forms her into a coherent whole. The ensemble is strong, but particularly worthy of note are Elizabeth Banks as the flashy and trashy (but also shrewd and oddly dignified) fiancee of the sisters' brother (Alessandro Nivola); and Masterson, always a refreshing, thoughtful presence, who really should make more movies. She probably would, if there were more movies like The Sisters: intelligent, observant entertainment designed for an adult audience. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and strong language.

"The Terminal: Comedy-drama. Starring Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) I'm not in love with The Terminal, but I liked every minute in it. Other films are like empty containers; this one's full. It's full of invention, full of moments, full of business, full of the nuances of human interaction, full of feeling. Perhaps it takes a picture about confinement to fully demonstrate how much Spielberg has always been about the journey, not the destination. With mediocre filmmakers, the whole movie is contained in the climax. With great filmmakers, the whole movie is happening every second. Tom Hanks gets his best role in several years as Viktor, a visitor from a small Eastern European nation who arrives at New York's JFK airport only to find out that his passport is invalid, following a sudden coup in his country. He can't go home, but without a valid passport he can't enter the United States, either. To make matters worse, he doesn't understand English, so when his plight is explained to him, he can only nod. He's set loose in the international airport to improvise a life for himself. Descriptions of The Terminal have made it sound gimmicky. What needs to be realized is that despite an undertone of whimsicality and the subtle comedy of Hanks' playing, Viktor's situation carries significant emotional weight. Certainly anyone who has ever been to a foreign country without knowing the language can immediately sympathize with Viktor's self-consciousness and near- panic every time he has to ask anyone for anything. (Likewise, Viktor's wild- eyed freak-out at seeing his country in flames on CNN without being able to understand the newscast brought me right back to my 2001 vacation, finding out about Sept. 11 on Italian television.) It's a feeling of complete dislocation and vulnerability. Yet gradually he gets the hang of it. Think of The Terminal as a less somber, less unintentionally ridiculous and more visually stimulating version of Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away, with Hanks once again figuring out how to eat, where to sleep and how to amuse himself in an inhospitable environment. Along with Spielberg, screenwriters Jeff Nathanson, Sacha Gervasi and Andrew Niccol somehow found a way to create a sense of forward motion, through what easily could have seemed like a succession of disparate incidents. The audience is even able to believe in and track the progress of Viktor's English- language immersion. Viktor meets a lot of people. Most significantly, he meets a flight attendant, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who takes an interest in Viktor, whom she assumes to be another frequent traveler. As played by Jones, who is even more beautiful than usual here, the flight attendant is like the female fantasy from countless 1970s films -- a warm, neurotic, available, troubled woman who, above all, is unaccountably attracted to the humble hero. The romance is appealing, but it also exists on the movie's fault line, the one between truth and fable. It's a strange thing to realize: Spielberg never adequately accounts for why Viktor must stay in that airport for months. Instead, he uses his cinematic fairy dust to make us stop asking the question. As you may have read, there's a fellow in France who has lived in de Gaulle airport for 15 years. In his case, he just refuses to leave. Spielberg eschews that possibility -- that would make Viktor a little nutty. Instead he puts the blame on the authorities, represented in this case by Stanley Tucci, as the frazzled head of airport security. But Spielberg won't go too far with that, either, because he wants to keep everybody within the realm of cuddly. It's something of a problem that Spielberg is uninterested in an honest examination of the very situation he presents. He's not interested in why a guy would live in an airport. Nor is he interested in why another guy would force a guy to live in an airport. You know what Spielberg is interested in? He's interested in making E.T.  all over again, because E.T. is precisely what Viktor turns into -- a wise, kind, benevolent alien who eventually has to go home, but in the meantime is all about sharing the love. Well, so what? E.T. was a good picture, too. Anyway, someone's got to make Spielberg movies, and it might as well be Spielberg. -- Advisory: Some mild ribald humor. ",1
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Horror. Starring Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Eric Balfour and R. Lee Ermey. Directed by Marcus Nispel. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.). What follows is a film that will offend responsible parents, animal lovers, power-tool salesmen, rural sheriffs, meat-packers, Lynyrd Skynyrd fans and even the core admirers of the 1974 Tobe Hooper-directed original Chainsaw. The remaining twisted population that likes this kind of movie will enjoy a horror film that is surprisingly stylish. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre may be an abomination, but it still delivers at least a $5 matinee price worth of scares, gore and homicidal killers who, no matter how many times you hit them, keep coming back. The new Chainsaw, directed by newcomer Marcus Nispel, also takes place in the early 1970s but quickly strays from the plot of the spooky and bizarre low- budget original. Instead of a woman and her friends investigating a grandfather's desecrated burial plot, these five companions (including 7th Heaven star Jessica Biel and Six Feet Under troublemaker Eric Balfour) are headed to a Skynyrd concert. A crazy family, a farmhouse and the human-skin-wearing Leatherface are at the core of the new Chainsaw, which also focuses on a backwoods sheriff played by Full Metal Jacket boot-camp tyrant R. Lee Ermey. But the movie -- produced by the director of Bad Boys II and the creator of television's Are You Hot? -- adds just enough over-the-top cliches from modern horror films to alienate serious fans of the original. Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski enigmatic and creepy in Hooper's movie, has become little more than Jason from Friday the 13th with a higher limit on his Home Depot gift card. And there is, of course, a modern sprinkler system in the family's otherwise run-down meat-packing plant, because that's the easiest way to get Biel's T-shirt wet (apparently backwoods homicidal killers are concerned about fire codes). The biggest stars in the film are production designer Gregory Blair and director of photography Daniel C. Pearl, who was Hooper's cinematographer on the original. Whether it's a graveyard of cars in an overgrown field or a trailer home that hasn't been cleaned in decades, attention to detail does more to create a horrific mood than anything in the script. But unlike movies such as Seven, there isn't enough style in the new The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to justify the bloodbath, and it's riddled with too much been-there-done-that to endure as a classic. Advisory: This film contains graphic violence and sexual situations. -- Peter Hartlaub Drag comedy. Starring Jack Plotnick, Clinton Leupp, Jeffery Roberson. Directed by Richard Day. (R. 79 minutes. At the Lumiere). I thought I was sick of drag, but no -- I was only sick of drag queens, and the sentiment, even reverence, with which they've been treated in movies of the past dozen or so years. Pictures such as Torch Song Trilogy and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert -- morose, laugh-clown-laugh wallows in self- pity and false glory -- could make anyone forget that drag, when done well, is funny. Really funny. Now comes along Girls Will Be Girls to make us remember. In the straight- faced, meticulous and dead-on hilarious tradition of the great Charles Pierce and the Bay Area's late, lamented Sluts a-Go-Go troupe, the film stars men in women's roles. These men don't have to push it. In just observing and accurately reproducing women's facial expressions and physical gestures, the men create a wonderfully absurd spectacle. They are aided by a caustic script that doesn't let in a single ray of light. The movie is about three roommates: Evie (Jack Plotnick), an aging actress with an alcohol problem; Coco (Clinton Leupp), who longs for romance and a child; and Varla (Jeffery Roberson), a plump and perky young thing who arrives in Hollywood and almost immediately becomes a prostitute. The movie follows each of the women, but Evie -- sexually ravenous and repellent, cruelly ambitious but completely past having any kind of career -- is the writer-director Richard Day's best creation. In Evie, we have a character completely without conscience, so that almost everything she says is appalling: Your mother offed herself -- excuse me -- passed herself away. Her drunken ramble through her apartment is a side- splitting spoof of the kind of scene that was a staple of every good Joan Crawford or Susan Hayward film. Equally priceless is her self-advertising infomercial, complete with songs, stories and a laugh track. An undeniable key to the success of Girls Will Be Girls is that the filmmaker knew when to quit. At 79 minutes, the movie is short but sweet. At 99 minutes, it would have been too much of a good thing. Advisory: This film contains sexual references and drug use. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Val Kilmer, Lisa Kudrow, Kate Bosworth, Dylan McDermott and Josh Lucas. Directed by James Cox. Written by James Cox, Captain Mauzner, Todd Samovitz and D. Loriston Scott. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If you ever find yourself idly wondering what life was like in the hard- drug underworld of Los Angeles circa 1981, Wonderland provides an unambiguous answer: as bad as it gets. It was sordid, brutal and depressing, and I'm not just talking about the sideburns on the male characters. Cheap shot, but the movie inspires jokes in spite of itself. The real-life events depicted in Wonderland are anything but funny. They are lurid in the extreme, culminating in bloody multiple murders at a drug den in Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon, a case involving the washed-up and strung-out porno actor John Holmes. Four people were bludgeoned to death at the party house, and a fifth survived horrible injuries. The killings appear to have been retaliation for the robbery and humiliation of Eddie Nash, a Los Angeles nightclub owner and drug dealer. Holmes, the film's central figure, was tried for the murders in 1982, and acquitted. (He died of AIDS-related illness in 1988. Nash eventually served time for the murders.) The film offers conflicting accounts of Holmes' role in the massacre -- was he forced to participate or did he simply tell Nash who had ripped him off? Despite Val Kilmer's game attempt to humanize Holmes, Wonderland never really makes us care about the answer. Kilmer has made a specialty of playing fringe figures dancing on the edge of the abyss (The Doors, of course, and more recently, The Salton Sea). His Holmes certainly lives up to the description provided by another character as a scumbag, stone thief and bad news. Though Holmes was a freebase addict, Kilmer endows him with a sort of boyish charm that would at least partly explain why his wife (played with dignity by Lisa Kudrow) never divorced him and why his girlfriend (Kate Bosworth) put up with his crummy antics, despite her extreme youth. He's a strange mixture of infantile and ruthless. Director James Cox conveys all this through a sickly yellowish haze and employs a range of MTV-style tricks to breathe some life into the stoned milieu. The killings are shown, mercifully, in a very underlit sequence, though they're still nothing for the faint of heart. Cox also lured a fairly remarkable cast of names, including Dylan McDermott playing, unexpectedly, a sleazy biker-type ex-con, Josh Lucas as a ferocious addict-psychopath and Tim Blake Nelson as a party-house habitue and one of the eventual victims. Eric Bogosian is slyly nasty as Nash, and Carrie Fisher pops up as a Christian who tries to help Bosworth's character. A few others (Janeane Garofalo, Christina Applegate) have small roles and are all but unrecognizable. If for some reason you are fascinated by the Wonderland murders, look up the Rolling Stone article of 1989 that brought national attention to the gruesome case. Otherwise, your local cineplex has lots of choices with more redeeming social value.. Advisory: This film contains strong language, frequent drug use and heavy violence. -- Walter Addiego Drama. Starring Chiara Mastroianni, Angela Molina, Lio, Lucia Sanchez, Esther Gorintin and Marilyne Even. Directed and written by Delphine Gleize. (Not rated. 130 minutes. At the Castro Theatre and Rafael Film Center.) There's a genre of film that's ideal for intelligent filmgoers. It's the one that threads multiple stories at once, letting a single incident expose the disparate connections among people who may be strangers. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing epitomizes the genre, as does Amores Perros, and now there's Carnage, a wonderful French offering whose jumping-off point is a bullfight. A TV network is broadcasting from a bull ring in southern Spain, where a young, handsome matador is challenging a ferocious bull. The matador is gored and suffers a life-threatening kidney wound. Watching from her home in northern France is a cute girl, whose parents will ultimately meet (thanks to the dead bull's remains, some of which are used for dog bones) an Italian actress who's struggling with her love life and her self-image. In death, the bull will link other characters in this quixotic drama, including the girl's teacher and mother, a taxidermist and his deaf father, and the matador and his friends. Funny, ironic (in the best sense of the word), dramatic, sweet and metaphorical, Carnage never lets go of its witty mix. The characters who populate Delphine Gleize's first full-length film are all imbued with multidimensionality, including the girl, who has a medical condition that requires her to take Valium, and the bull. Yes, the bull. It turns out that he was blind in one eye -- a revelation that lets one character (a philandering scientist) ruminate about the nature of danger and deceiving appearances. A filmmaker to watch, Gleize (who is French) doesn't need cinematic tricks to create cinematic tension. She uses ambiguity and her characters' hidden agendas to great effect, and she gets inspired performances from an ensemble cast that includes Chiara Mastroianni (the daughter of Catherine Deneuve and Marcello Mastroianni) and Angela Molina (daughter of Antonio Molina). Advisory: This film contains scenes of death. -- Jonathan Curiel Drama. Starring Clara Khoury, Khalifa Natour, Ismael Dabbag and Walid Abed Elsalam. Directed by Hany Abu-Assad. Written by Liana Badr and Ihab Lamey. (Not rated. 90 minutes. In Arabic with English subtitles. At the Roxie.) You're a young Palestinian woman in East Jerusalem, and you're in love with a theater director whom your conservative father loathes. He wants you to marry from his list of men, and he gives you a deadline: Decide by 4 p.m. At that point, he leaves for Egypt, where he'll be unable to give his personal OK to any man you've chosen. Hany Abu-Assad has made a bittersweet film that tells the story of Palestinian life as eloquently as anything ever done. The characters in Rana's Wedding are suffocated by Israeli checkpoints and restrictions, but that doesn't stop them from trying to lead normal lives, including the universal ritual of marriage. Rana (Clara Khoury) isn't some radicalized Hamas supporter; in fact, though her family is Muslim, she seems avowedly secular and prefers to wear form- fitting clothing that might as well be from an L.L. Bean catalog. Like her love, Khalil, Rana is used to following her bliss -- but unlike Khalil (who works in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where roadblocks pose a daily hardship), she lives a relatively sheltered and privileged life in Jerusalem. Her father's ultimatum has the unintended effect of making her more defiant -- and more conscious (as she tries to visit Khalil) of the deep quagmire that defines Israeli-Palestinian relations. It's not giving anything away to say that Rana tries to beat the 4 p.m. deadline. The plan that unfolds features as many emotional detours (including Rana's doubts about Khalil) as physical ones (including shortcuts past checkpoints). Rana's Wedding works so well because Abu-Assad lets the narrative unfold in completely surprising and realistic ways, and he lets Khoury's expressions and exasperations -- not heavy-handed dialogue -- set many scenes. Khoury, who is in nearly every scene, is formidable. A piano motif adds a perfect layer to Rana's Wedding. Rana learned piano as a child (we learn during the opening credits), and Abu-Assad adds evocative music throughout the film to signify Rana's memories and feelings, and to emphasize transitions. The last scene (which incorporates Mahmoud Darwish's poem State of Siege is an unforgettable coda to a film that deserves the acclaim it got previously at Cannes and other international film festivals. Advisory: This film contains scenes of violence.. -- Jonathan Curiel Science fiction. Starring Takeshi Kaneshiro, Anne Suzuki and Goro Kishitani. Directed by Takeshi Yamazaki. (R. 118 minutes. At the Galaxy.) After years of watching Americans churn out blockbusters that recycle the ideas of unsung Japan filmmakers, director Takeshi Yamazaki sets the record straight in a single film. Returner is less a new Japanese movie than a series of scenes from old American ones, most notably The Terminator and ET. Only subtitles and a few borrowed ideas from the Japan-born video game Metal Gear Solid prevent the movie from looking like an American Film Institute clip show. That's not to say the little-girl-goes-back-in-time-tosave-humankind movie is flat-out horrible. With little room for new ideas, the film must rely on the strength of its actors, and they're excellent across the board. Anne Suzuki plays Milly, a young warrior who hops into the time machine from Stargate to prevent an alien force from destroying the human race. Faster than you can say, I'm looking for Sarah Connor, Milly finds loner gunman Miyamoto (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who must work with her to stop a vicious crime lord (Goro Kishitani) and prevent the invasion. American directors make plenty of sophomoric movies with bad special effects (Dungeons & Dragons and Reign of Fire, to name two), but they never get talent as good as Kaneshiro. The long-haired hunk has a serious Han Solo thing going, and is particularly roguish when dealing with Milly, who brings out the best in the brooding anti-hero. Returner would get a stronger recommendation if it weren't for the following paradox: With its Saturday morning cartoon plot and Battlestar Galactica-era special effects, the movie seems aimed at prepubescent boys. But the stark violence, including more than one execution-style killing of innocent civilians, makes it inappropriate for children. That leaves a small demographic for Returner -- 12-year-olds who are skilled at talking adults into buying R-movie tickets. Director Yamazaki was inspired as a youngster by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg films. Returner has the same sense of humor and adventurous pace that make the film's cliches bearable.

"The U.S. vs. John Lennon: Documentary. With Yoko Ono, Walter Cronkite, Mario Cuomo and others. Directed by David Leaf and John Scheinfeld. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Within limits, this is an excellent documentary. Even fans who think they've seen everything will see things here they haven't seen. Sometimes the footage is familiar, but it runs longer here than in other documentaries. The U.S. vs. John Lennon concentrates on Lennon's post-Beatles years, in which he did a lot of great work that's overlooked today, and it's good to have a lot shown on that period. For non-fans, those not familiar with Lennon, particularly young people, the movie might even be a revelation, an introduction to a great talent and one of the most likable and singular personalities of the modern era. The filmmakers' ambition, however, goes beyond this. The documentary is an attempt at a political document, as well, but on that score it's as politically naive as Lennon, and it's also incomplete. It lumps together the entire anti-war and pro-revolution movement, films it through a rosy gauze and then sets up Richard Nixon as the embodiment of all evil. Suffice it to say, the Nixon who went to China and Russia isn't here, and the crooked, bigheaded, sweaty and awkward Nixon is all over the documentary. We also get the Nixon who used the FBI, the INS and Justice Department to get Lennon thrown out of the country, not because he believed that Lennon was a risk to the nation but because he feared Lennon would galvanize the youth movement in favor of the Democrats in the 1972 election. Lennon was wiretapped, followed and harassed and eventually threatened with deportation, because of his high-profile work as an anti-war spokesman. The movie documents his three-year struggle to stay in the country. Though Lennon deliberately presented himself as a clown and a publicity hound, the film makes a strong case for him as a man of character, who could have had an easy life and instead followed his conscience. His work for peace was his way of making sense and use of his fame, a fame so immense by 1969 as to be grotesque. The U.S. vs. John Lennon was clearly made with the intention of pointing out the parallels between our time and the early '70s, the most obvious being an unpopular war. In fact, the contrasts are equally interesting. Bush may be an unpopular president, but Nixon won 49 states in the 1972 election. The repression of dissent was more active circa 1970, but today the government seems to have figured out a way to absorb, deflect and marginalize opposing viewpoints. Nixon had to contend with a probing, skeptical television media. Today, television media is relatively tame, worried about alienating viewers who already know what they think, irrespective of the facts. It's hard to say which era had it worse, but at least they had Lennon. The soundtrack is filled with Lennon songs from albums that people don't buy any more -- such as Plastic Ono Band and Imagine -- and singles such as Instant Karma and Cold Turkey. It's a body of work worthy of rediscovery. -- Advisory: Some harsh language. ",1
"The Valet: Comedy. Starring Daniel Auteuil, Gad Elmaleh, Alice Taglioni and Kristin Scott Thomas. Directed by Francis Veber. (PG-13. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) [Podcast: Movies with Mick LaSalle: OK movies with big problems but Mick likes 'em anyway.]This is not just a matter of wishing the pleasure might have been extended. The comparative shortness is indicative, rather, of the movie's sole flaw: Veber doesn't know how to end his movie. True, he knows how the audience would like the story to resolve, and he does get there. But he doesn't find a mechanically interesting way to do it. After putting this wonderful machinery in place, he more or less just pulls the plug. He ties things up quickly with a couple of pleasant but lackluster scenes and gets out, leaving the movie feeling truncated. Fine. If he couldn't come up with a great ending, at least he didn't belabor it, and along the way The Valet is a total pleasure. Veber sets up a delightful and absurd situation. A nice, nerdy guy (Gad Elmaleh), who works as a parking valet, is walking down the street one day, and just as he's passing two people having an argument, a tabloid photographer snaps a photo. It turns out that those two people are a billionaire businessman (Daniel Auteuil) who is cheating on his wife, and Elena (Alice Taglioni), the most famous supermodel in France. Now the billionaire is in big trouble with his wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), who owns a controlling share in his business. He needs to be rescued from this mess, and his lawyer has an idea: Find that other guy in the photo and have him claim that Elena is his girlfriend. In fact, to make it look really good, pay off Elena so that she's willing to live with the guy. And so, this nice hapless fellow -- who has no money and who is still forlorn that the girl of his dreams (Virginie Ledoyen) won't marry him -- winds up with a supermodel living in his apartment. What's more, to make things look good, they have to sleep in the same bed. From this Veber spins a series of comic situations: Our hero's friends and family are astounded at what they believe is a remarkable turn in his love life.

"The Warrior: Drama. Starring Irfan Khan, Puru Chhibber and Noor Mani. Directed by Asif Kapadia. (R. 88 minutes. In Hindi with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) It takes place about 1,000 years ago, in northern India, and it begins with a domestic scene, of a boy and his father. Lafcadia (Irfan Khan) is about to go off to work, and his son (Puru Chhibber) wants to come with him and learn the ropes of the job. The father, however, puts him off, believing the young man to be too young. At first we imagine that the father, who is strong, decent and concerned, is either being overly cautious or knows his son's weaknesses and wants him to overcome them before he lets the boy take on his trade. It doesn't occur to us, any more than it occurs to the boy, that the father is, in fact, trying to delay his son's entrance into a terrible life -- and from the awful knowledge that Dad is not some normal soldier but a henchman for an evil warlord. Actor Khan is a rugged man with sad eyes. His eyes, in fact, are not unlike Terrence Howard's in Hustle & Flow, those of a potentially decent man who knows he's living an indecent life. We see Lafcadia on a typical day at the office: It's tax day, and villagers are coming from all over to pay tribute to the warlord. An old man from a poor village brings only a partial payment, so the warlord orders Lafcadia to chop the old guy's head off. What can Lafcadia do? He's there. He's on the clock. It's his job. He's being paid. And the boss is already in a testy mood. But it gets worse. The warlord then orders Lafcadia and his men to go to the village, burn it to the ground and kill everybody in it. From the way Lafcadia reacts, we understand that this is a routine order and that carrying out such orders is something that he has done on many occasions. Lafcadia is not really a soldier. He's a professional executioner, thug and assassin. He's living an utterly indefensible life, except for one thing: His affection for his son is real. That's his one hold on human decency, the thin rope from which he might climb out of this moral abyss. People will come away from The Warrior remembering it as measured or slow in pace, but it packs a lot of action into 88 minutes. For the entire first section of the film, the movie follows the boy and his father, and it's unclear, in a good way, who will be the film's focus. There's a languorous, finding-its-way feeling to the movie. The camera takes in the mountain and desert vistas, scenes are allowed to breathe, and the dialogue is sparing -- a major virtue in a subtitled film. Yet anyone who pays attention cannot help but be impressed with how much information and emotion the screenplay is able to put across, often with just a line of dialogue. The truth is, The Warrior is always pushing forward, advancing the story, and it covers a lot of ground, internally and geographically. Long before the end, it takes on the quality of a wise fable and reveals itself as an enriching experience. -- Advisory: This film contains violence. ",1
"The White Countess: Drama. Starring Ralph Fiennes and Natasha Richardson. Directed by James Ivory. (PG-13. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The occasion for this rumination is The White Countess, a film that, with the death of Merchant last year, becomes the last of the Merchant-Ivory collaborations. Measured and meticulous, with small patches of narrative awkwardness that are more than compensated for by rich performances, it's an appropriate finish to the 40-year partnership: a typical, above-average Merchant-Ivory film. Written by Kazuo Ishiguro (The Remains of the Day), the picture takes place in Shanghai, in the year leading up to the 1937 Japanese invasion. The title character is a White Russian countess, Sofia (Natasha Richardson), a refugee of the Communist revolution, living in squalor with her extended family of aristocrats, including her aunt (Richardson's real-life mother, Vanessa Redgrave) and her wicked mother-in-law, Olga (played with relish by Richardson's real-life aunt, Lynn Redgrave). The family contributes nothing to its support and survives entirely on Sofia's income, which she derives by working as a taxi-dancer and occasional prostitute. As played by Richardson, Sofia walks through life in a state of muted pain, with the look of someone who has seen too much of the world even to smile in an unguarded way. Her forced education in human nature has been not only at the hands of the Bolsheviks or her male clients in Shanghai, but at the hands of her family. Though she is their sole means of support, her sister-in-law, Greshenka (Madeleine Potter), and Olga treat her like a pariah. The White Countess is the story of how two very different people, damaged by war, come together in an unlikely professional partnership, on the eve of yet another war. Ralph Fiennes plays Todd Jackson, a former American diplomat who has lost his family and his eyesight to a series of incidents. The violence has cast him adrift, and his blindness has turned him inward, so that he has no plans to leave Shanghai but instead dreams of opening the ideal nightclub -- the platonic ideal of which he claims to see in his head. I have to say that fully half of my pleasure in watching The White Countess was in watching Fiennes. To see him play an American is a little like watching a female impersonator. The simulation is not exact, but through the elements emphasized, one sees things one otherwise might never notice. As the countess, being Russian, reacts to disaster with the fatalistic sense of having her expectations confirmed, the American reacts with perplexity, and even when cynical, he has an ingenuous air. He expects life to be nice. This can be a strength or a weakness, depending on the circumstances, but it's part of the American national character, and Fiennes portrays that. His performance is, in a sense, very much a portrayal, an interpretation funneled through the actor, in which we're meant to notice both the actor and the interpretation. Laurence Olivier gave performances like this all the time -- broad character turns in which half the appeal was the character work and half the fun was seeing Olivier do his stuff. It's a curious pleasure, in that it seems so against what we think we want from actors: that they should disappear inside their roles. We should not be able to see them acting -- we think. And then we see Fiennes in The White Countess acting up a storm, acting every second, acting in a way that we can't help but notice, and doing it all for us, and it's an absolute blast. The movie has a slow start, but Ivory is laying in foundations for later. Sofia and Jackson meet by chance, and she becomes the hostess and centerpiece of the dream bar he opens, The White Countess. Against a convincing backdrop of colorful locations and political turmoil, the movie shows off this friendship deepening. Long before the climax, which is magnificent, the movie has us completely believing in these characters and their histories and marveling at their extraordinary circumstances. This is Merchant-Ivory's kind of showmanship, the unflashy adult variety of movie magic that they made their hallmark. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and some violence. ",1
"The Woodsman: Drama. Starring Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Benjamin Bratt and Mos Def. Directed by Nicole Kassell. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In her feature debut, director Nicole Kassell finds the elusive balance. Particularly impressive (and emblematic of the movie as a whole) is the way in which she conveys exactly what it is that Walter (Kevin Bacon) -- a serial molester, newly released from prison -- likes to do to little girls. The audience needs to know because we need to know whom we're looking at. At the same time, an explicit exposition would be inartistic and unwelcome. And so Kassell finds a way to communicate the information wordlessly and gracefully and yet with a clarity that's unmistakable. That's The Woodsman in a nutshell, tasteful but not compromised. Walter leaves prison after serving a 12-year sentence, and it doesn't take long for us to realize that he has precisely the same sexual impulses that he had a dozen years before. The only question is whether he'll be able to keep those impulses in check, every minute of every day for the rest of his life. It's a daunting challenge. In Bacon's portrayal, Walter chooses to face this challenge by completely locking down emotionally. This makes sense, especially when one considers the primal nature of sex: Suppress every possible expression of that, try to dismantle those feelings from the inside, at the source, and a lot of the personality disappears in the process. The movie shows that Walter has no choice: In one scene, he lets his guard down slightly and asks a demented question that reveals his inner life. He asks a besotted father if he's ever been sexually attracted to his 12-year-old daughter. The downside of a movie featuring a closed-down portrayal of a closed- down protagonist is that the atmosphere of The Woodsman gets dry and chilly. There's no faulting Bacon, who makes an intelligent choice based on the script, and no faulting the film, even if it does get tiring, at times, to watch a fellow who has to think twice before answering every question, usually by saying nothing. The important thing to know is that The Woodsman arrives somewhere. It goes some place memorable. The movie derives considerable vitality from Kyra Sedgwick (Bacon's real- life wife), who plays Vicki, a hard-living woman who works in the same lumberyard as Walter. She looks at Walter and recognizes an essential decency and sensitivity. She can tell that he's wounded, and she intuits that he has a dark secret. She knows he has something bad in his past, though she assumes it's something more socially acceptable, like being an ax murderer. The notion of Sedgwick as a child molester's first grown-up girlfriend is priceless because Sedgwick does not play Vicki as a starter girlfriend, someone young and delicate. Rather she represents a dive off the high board into the deep waters of adult female complexity. With nothing of the girl about her, this is a woman with a complicated past, loads of anger and adult needs that cannot be satisfied with a fistful of candy. The movie provides an arresting collision of characters and -- to their enormous credit -- a satisfying pairing of actors. Husbands and wives rarely work this well together, especially with such dicey material. There's a scene in which Bacon and Sedgwick play two people having sex for the first time. If it's like that every night in the Bacon household, they ought to write a manual. Ultimately, of course, it becomes necessary for The Woodsman to show Walter interacting with a real object of his fantasies, an 11-year-old girl. It's the make-or-break scene, and the film more than delivers. To describe it or even characterize it would risk giving away the nature of it, so a generic it's powerful will have to suffice. Notably, its power doesn't derive just from Bacon but at least equally from the child actress, Hannah Pilkes, who is just remarkable. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, nudity, sex talk and strong language.

"The Worlds Fastest Indian: Drama. Starring Anthony Hopkins. Directed by Roger Donaldson. (PG-13. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Indian of the title refers to the brand of motorcycle he drove, a 1920 Indian that he tinkered with in his garage for many years, turning it into a combination rocket/junk heap/death trap/glory of the age. All this makes The World's Fastest Indian qualify as a kind of sports movie, and to a degree it benefits from the usual sports-movie excitement: The sheer spectacle, the will-he-do-it, the can-he-do-it, the rooting interest, the kick of racing in general. But the movie's real appeal runs deeper than that, just as the narrative approach of Roger Donaldson, who wrote and directed, is more ambitious. Donaldson takes Munro's story and turns it into a whimsical voyage and return saga, the odyssey of a man, pure in heart, across a troubled America. The focus is not so much on Munro's accomplishments as it is on his personality, which is made vivid in Hopkins' performance. He plays Munro as a scattered man, an eccentric not quite in tune with his fellows, isolated somewhat by his own peculiar brilliance and by some hearing loss. (I never saw a film in which a lead character asked, What d'ya say? so often.) He's a fascinating character, seemingly going through life encased in a protective vagueness, yet casually demonstrating a laser-like acuity at select moments. He might be a genius, but to his credit, he doesn't seem to know it. A movie like this can only start in first gear. Burt is an old man who putters in his garage all day, waking up the neighbors, letting his lawn go to seed, collecting junk in his backyard, a likable crank. He seems like a fellow near the finish line. He has angina attacks and has to carry around a bottle of nitroglycerin pills. He has a lifelong dream of going to the Salt Flats and really letting his motorcycle rip, but it doesn't seem realistic. It's not realistic -- they don't make movies about realistic people. As is fitting for a voyage saga, every aspect of Burt's journey from New Zealand to Utah is fraught with trouble. Because of his limited means, his only transportation option is to ride a freighter and serve as the ship's cook. When he arrives in Los Angeles, he gets a nasty cab driver, is propositioned and robbed by a prostitute and ends up staying in a fleabag hotel. But his oblivious good cheer and nonjudgmental nature get him through most situations. His personality cracks through people's reserve. The World's Fastest Indian is as much about the getting there as it is about what Burt does after he arrives. Burt encounters all kinds of people from Los Angeles to Bonneville, and somewhere, midway, the lovely thing happens: The movie takes on a magical quality. In one scene, he stumbles into a romantic interlude with a farmwoman his own age. In another, he walks into bars and strikes up conversation with anyone he sees. Donaldson finds a pleasant, measured rhythm and makes a viewer feel as if it would be quite all right to watch Burt's journey for hours and hours. He is, after all, the only unself-conscious man in America, and we look upon him in the same way as most people do in the movie, with bemusement, at first, then fascination, and then affection. It's wise on Donaldson's part to show that not everyone is susceptible to Burt's eccentric charm. Some people feel threatened by his purity, some are callously amused by it, some are sour and unreachable. Donaldson depicts the America of the mid-1960s as a place of burgeoning anxiety, a stewpot of ugliness and sweetness and leftover innocence. Burt, an instinctive egalitarian who sees everyone as of equal value, serves as a human Rorschach test. People react to him in accordance with their own individual character and degree of mental health, while he remains contented and unchanged. -- Advisory: Sexual situations. ",1
"The abundance of biblical epics over the decades has left behind a minefield of movie cliches. The result is that, with the slightest misstep, the most pious and well-intentioned film can explode into unintended farce. The only hope is to devise a brand-new strategy, and that’s what we find in “Risen,” a movie that’s different, not only in its point of view but also in its presentation of biblical events.The movie’s whole approach is secular. To be sure, the movie is ultimately a critique of secularism, but it’s a shrewd critique, one that begins by persuading us to root for the Romans against a mob of Jewish insurgents. After all, the Jews look like a bunch of scruffy, humorless religious fanatics, while the Romans are efficient, well groomed and ironic. They seem like people who can actually run an empire, and probably should.At the head of the small Roman force is the military tribune, Clavius, played by a sturdy-looking Joseph Fiennes. Clavius is an ambitious guy, just putting in his time in some miserable outpost of the empire. His boss is Pontius Pilate, who has no idea that he has just stepped into history by crucifying Yeshua, a Nazarene religious zealot. Clavius arrives at the scene of the crucifixion in its final minutes, and the sight is squalid and horrible — but also, in the most dispiriting possible way, routine. That would seem to be the end of a very minor chapter in Clavius’ life, but the Jewish high priest Caiaphas shows up, insisting that the Romans guard the tomb. Caiaphas is worried that Yeshua’s associates might steal the body and proclaim his resurrection, and so Clavius gets the job of sealing the tomb and appointing guards to stand watch.You pretty much know what happens from there, but how it’s all perceived, by the characters and by the audience, makes “Risen” a different kind of experience. In every biblical epic of the 1950s, the Romans were effete and had English accents, while the Jews were more or less like the audience. But here, the Romans are like us — modern people, with recognizable worldviews and life plans, living amid a poverty-ridden, backward and superstitious culture. At least a third of the movie is like a detective story, with Clavius and an assistant questioning witnesses, trying to locate a dead body.Here and there are little hints that maybe it’s not so great being a Roman. In a reflective moment, Pilate asks Clavius what the younger man hopes to achieve through worldly success. His reply tells us that all Clavius really wants is to work like a dog in the hope of a little peace at the end of his life. A bit later, Pilate points to a corpse and tells Clavius, “In a few years, that’s us.” The secular life is attractive and recognizable, but a dead end.Every biblical epic treats Jesus’ disciples as either gentle simpletons or wooden idols, but in “Risen” they are just normal men, from various ages and backgrounds, trying to process the miraculous. Bartholomew (Stephen Hagan) is like a proto-hippie, freaking out at the delight of it all, while Peter is a middle-aged no-nonsense fisherman just trying to keep up with events. And Jesus (Cliff Curtis), instead of speaking like an oracle (like, say, Jeffrey Hunter in “King of Kings”), is calm, benevolent and baffling.The difference between “Risen” and other biblical films perhaps can best be described in this way: Here, whenever the miraculous happens, it happens on an otherwise unremarkable day. And so people react as they would — they are transformed, and yet they’re not. They’re astonished, and yet normal reality surrounds them, so that it’s hard to believe their own eyes. At one point, Clavius is sitting with Jesus, expressing his religious doubts, even after all that he has seen. And yet this doesn’t seem at all strange. We understand.Director Kevin Reynolds, who also co-wrote the script, doesn’t strive to lift audiences up into the sky. He keeps one foot on the ground and lets you experience it as the people must have 2,000 years ago. Whatever your religious affiliation, you will come away thinking that if all this did actually happen, it probably happened something like this.",1
"The action scenes in “The Gunman” are expertly handled, and that should come as no surprise, with director Pierre Morel calling the shots here. Morel directed the original and best of the “Taken” series, and though that movie is especially remembered for Liam Neeson’s set of skills, Morel’s mix of propulsion and clarity was a big part of its success.Some action directors seem to shut off their minds when the action starts, figuring if they just shake the camera and cut fast enough, the mere fact of action will hold audiences to their seats. Morel sees action as an opportunity. He has the audience’s attention, and now he’s going to stretch things out, add the frightening and telling detail, and make you suffer in the best way. He puts the viewer in the protagonist’s shoes.This time, the shoes are worn by Sean Penn, which means a different kind of action movie, something with some ideas and a conscience, but not so many ideas or so big a conscience as to slow things down. When we first meet him, he is working in  Congo for a mining company. He has a few overt, benign functions, but we get the feeling that more is going on, and this is soon confirmed when he is assigned to assassinate a politician. Basically, “The Gunman” is a movie that asks audiences to sympathize with the equivalent of Lee Harvey Oswald — that is, an Oswald who definitely did it. Oddly enough, it succeeds, partly because the moral climate it presents seems so confused, but mainly because of Penn’s particular aura of irascible integrity. He’s the most irritated action hero since Harrison Ford. It helps that the poor gunman feels really guilty about his crime. Killing that politician pretty much wrecked his life. It separated him from his fiancee and from his own sense of himself. He already wishes he could take it all back — even before people come out of the woodwork, eight years later, looking to murder him.And that’s pretty much the action of “The Gunman”: Once Jim (Penn) arrives at the disconcerting realization that people want him dead, his mission is to find out who is behind it while fending off attacks from scores of hired assassins. Morel gives the impression that if he ever made a movie with fewer than 50 corpses, he’d have a hard time looking at himself in the mirror.Though the story might have a certain sameness (calm interlude followed by attack; then a shorter calm interlude followed by a bigger attack), the action varies enough and the central mystery is arresting enough that “The Gunman” maintains a sure grip on the viewer. The sequence in which Jim and his former fiancee (Jasmine Trinca) try to escape a besieged country house is a model for that sort of scene — it’s extreme, detailed and not too far-fetched. A later action sequence, at a Spanish bullfight, is equally effective.Just for fun, the story — based on the novel by Jean-Patrick Manchette — gives Jim the added handicap of a traumatic brain injury. It’s the movie’s wild card: Whenever it looks as if he might have the upper hand, the old head pain and blurred vision kick in. Along the way, “The Gunman” conveys a sense of some vast unseen underworld, in which there are people who can always get you a car, or fake papers, or an unregistered gun; and who know how to do things — as in, everything associated with survival. But “The Gunman” is not about the glamour of this kind of existence. Rather, it emphasizes the spiritual cost to life on the fringes. Javier Bardem is particularly good in a supporting role, showing the perverting effects of fear and guilt. As Jim’s once and future girlfriend, Trinca serves an important function, as the movie’s lone civilian. She’s the one who convinces us that Jim could be redeemed, that his life might be worth living. In a way, she’s like the daughter in “Taken.” She tethers him to earth just enough that we care what happens to him.",1
"The best thing about “Ant-Man” is that, for much of its running time, it doesn’t seem like a Marvel Comics superhero movie. The worst thing about it is that it eventually does. Sooner or later, men in skintight suits are shown doing battle, probably to save humanity or something like that. But even then, the action remains close to human scale, or at least closer than usual.So “Ant-Man” is a strange case, a superhero movie that might appeal most to people who would never go see a superhero movie — not for free, not even on an airplane, maybe not even to save wounded fawns and baby rabbits. At the same time, it just might disappoint audiences who see the name Marvel not as some unfortunate movie phase we’ll just have to live through, but as a stamp of cinematic excellence. The first clue that this is going to be a different sort of Marvel movie is that it’s directed by Peyton Reed, whose stock in trade is comedy and whose 2003 movie, “Down With Love,” was one of the shrewdest satires of the previous decade. From the beginning, the rhythms are comic and the tone is arch. And the comedy is not the cheap comedy of veiled references to other movies. It’s grounded in character.The second clue is the casting of Paul Rudd, a comic actor who is refreshingly unheroic, but also not a nerd in need of superhero transformation. He’s normal, only a little funnier than most people. At the start of the movie, he is being released from prison, having used his computer genius to steal money from a huge corporation and divert it to customers. In other words, he is already a Robin Hood. Becoming Ant-Man won’t be a step up, but more like a lateral move.Like a lot of superhero movies, “Ant-Man” attracted some strong talent. Unlike most of them, “Ant-Man” doesn’t leave the actors looking like greedy sellouts leaping on a paycheck. Michael Douglas plays scientist Hank Pym, who, already in 1989, invented the molecule-crunching formula that makes it possible for Ant-Man to exist. He must have been a genius, because 26 years later, his protege (Corey Stoll) is only now catching up, and he plans to do precisely the thing that Hank refused to do — sell the discovery to defense contractors.For a surprising length of screen time, the science fiction is relegated to the periphery, and “Ant-Man” is just the story of Scott Lang (Rudd) and his problems. Released from prison, Scott can’t find a job. He can’t pay child support. His wife (Judy Greer) won’t let him see his daughter, and her new boyfriend (an implacable Bobby Cannavale) is blocking the door. He realizes he may have to turn to crime just to get enough money to survive. This first section doesn’t feel like a prelude, but like the substance of the entire picture. So when “Ant-Man” finally takes a Marvel turn and starts reminding us, at first subtly, that it’s a superhero movie, the first thought is, “Oh no, why did you have to go ruin it?” It was pretty good as it was — the story of a nice guy trying to find his footing after a prison term. Why bring in skintight costumes and saving the world? It’s been done and done, then done to death, then revived and done, then done some more ...That’s the peculiar problem of “Ant-Man.” By being more than a superhero movie, it reminds us of what it’s worse than. Its greatest virtue isn’t that it’s a superior comic book movie, but rather that it comes close to not being that at all. Close, and yet not close enough.By the way, it should be said what Ant-Man is and what he can do. Wearing his special suit, he is capable of shrinking in size and then growing back to normal size in the blink of an eye. This can be useful in a fight. The shifts in size, as well as Ant-Man’s ability to make other objects grow and contract when necessary, make for some clever action sequences and funny moments.Yet one of the best sequences isn’t funny at all. It comes when Scott visits the land of subatomic particles. Something in the rendering of that, with light bending and folding, exploding and re-forming, really does evoke an unseen world, something splendid and terrifying at the heart of things. It’s an unexpected and deepening moment in an otherwise lighthearted movie, and it rounds out the experience. ",1
"The big achievement of “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” is that it does two things simultaneously that would seem to be in contradiction. It presents life as a Western journalist in Afghanistan as horrible in every way — dangerous, ugly and miserable. And it also shows how that life could be attractive, even addictive. Moreover it doesn’t just tell you this, it makes you feel it, so that you end up envying people in one of the worst places on Earth.“Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” is based on “The Taliban Shuffle,” a memoir by Kim Barker, who was the Chicago Tribune’s South Asia bureau chief from 2004 to 2009. The movie changes things a bit. Here Tina Fey plays Kim Baker, who is working as a copywriter for a TV network when she impulsively volunteers for the Afghanistan assignment. This little alteration of fact makes the character more of an innocent abroad, while conveniently making her business less cerebral and more visual.She has a baptism by fire in an early scene. Working as an “embed” with the Marines, she’s part of a convoy that’s attacked by insurgents. With machine gun bullets bouncing off the vehicle, she nervously unbuckles her seat belt, and the first thing we think is that she is about to panic. Instead, she picks up a video camera, jumps out of the truck and starts shooting the battle from inside the thick of it.This is an important moment and in several ways. First, Fey persuades us to believe this woman would actually do that. Second, it’s the moment that we realize that this is the story of an extraordinary person, someone who might seem ordinary in most ways, but has drives and impulses that can only be answered by this kind of mad environment. Third, it signals that “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” is not a comedy as we usually understand it. It’s more like an unblinking presentation of absurdity on a mass scale.Robert Carlock’s screenplay is impressive in what it doesn’t say. No one ever mentions that the appeal of this life is intimately entwined with the possibility of being dead the next minute. It’s just understood. Suddenly this woman is riding helicopters into war zones, and we get it. This is not life as we usually know it, with thoughts stuck in the past and anxieties about the future. This is nothing but now, which makes life in the rickety hotel where Kim lives with other journalists a kind of middle-aged, booze-soaked version of the last days of Pompeii. Like spring break with wrinkles.The story is a journey for Kim Baker, but it’s one the audience has the experience of sharing. So we start, as she does, huddled in the hotel and hearing the sound of distant gunfire, convinced this is a hellhole and wanting to escape. And we end up, very soon, feeling the addict’s dilemma, wondering if today is the day to stop, or if one more high is worth the risk.Margot Robbie plays Tanya, Kim’s best friend and professional rival, and it’s a real asset to have someone with that kind of a star wattage in a supporting role. She’s utterly believable as a TV star, but she fills in the character’s undercurrents as well, suggesting that there is something slightly wrong with her, as though she’s found a semi-healthy channel for a self-destructive impulse. Martin Freeman plays a roguish Scottish photographer, and at first the role seems odd casting for an actor of Freeman’s sensitivity. Then it doesn’t.“Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” is by far Fey’s best movie. It makes use of her comic sense, but also of her watchful wariness and underlying wistfulness. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have complete command of the movie’s tone, and the screenplay never forces Fey into doing anything fake. There are none of the false conflicts and crises that you get in the last third of most comedies. In fact, one of the best things about “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” is that it has no particular climax at all. In place of a story with a classic structure, we get an emotionally honest rendering of a episode, something really interesting that happened in somebody’s life. And so it feels real.",1
"The force of will — not nature, but human will — that we call Tom Cruise gets a serious workout in “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” and it’s an impressive thing to witness. First of all, the man has stopped aging, and no one even thinks that’s weird. He is 53 but seems to have stopped the clock at 35, and if he keeps this up for another five years, it will be time to either call in scientists or start speculating about Lucifer.His acting is also an act of will. Cruise brings a conviction to his scenes here that is  partly the character’s, but mostly it’s as if he keeps repeating, “I am Tom Cruise, and I am going to fill your mind with this very important thing I am about to say.” And everything he says is important. He has a scene with Simon Pegg in which he’s incredibly intense, and one can hardly imagine why. And then Pegg is intense right back at him, not because that makes any sense, but because Pegg has entered Cruise Land, where all the molecules start vibrating because Tom is in the room.Cruise’s  entrance in this fifth installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise is particularly memorable. His colleagues in the Impossible Mission Force are trying to figure out how to ground a terrorist airplane before it takes off bearing enough nerve gas to choke a major city. Suddenly from out of nowhere, Cruise appears — should I really say “Ethan Hunt”? — and he’s running toward the plane. His colleagues didn’t even know he was in town. He just shows up, jumps onto the wing and hangs from the door as the plane takes off. You can write the rest of the scene yourself.The old rule was that action heroes, past the age of 47 or 48, enter a geriatric phase, at which point audiences stop thinking, “This guy sure knows how to fight” and start thinking, “Why does Dad keep on beating up people?” But Cruise is writing his own rules. This time, as always, he leaps from tall buildings, rides a motorcycle like a carnival daredevil and takes numerous punches and falls, without it ever once crossing any viewer’s mind that this might be a strain for him. Of course, Ethan Hunt is straining all over the place, but Tom Cruise has got this.Incidentally, this may be the first “Mission Impossible” movie in which Cruise’s real height (5 feet 7) is a factor in the fight scenes. Usually, the movies try to create the illusion that Cruise is at least two or three inches taller, but in several places here the disparity in size between him and his opponents becomes something else he must overcome. This is Cruise’s only new concession to physical reality, and it’s a refreshing one.This time Ethan Hunt and his team are fighting everybody. A diabolical terrorist syndicate, run by a soft-spoken maniac (Sean Harris), is on the verge of acquiring enough working capital to act as a kind of mobile rogue nation. Meanwhile, the new CIA director (a sneering Alec Baldwin) shuts down the Impossible Mission Force, because he thinks they’re a bunch of cowboys operating without oversight. Which is not exactly untrue.Christopher McQuarrie, who wrote and directed, previously wrote and directed “Jack Reacher,” which wasn’t much. But here McQuarrie devises a film that’s a succession of riveting sequences, filmed in a way that’s active and yet elegant. The camera keeps moving within shots, but not in a subjective, jittery way, but rather like a third-person narrator calmly emphasizing the essential points.Cruise, who produced the film, pairs himself well in “Mission.” For most of the movie, he shares the screen with Pegg, who is appealing as his nervous sidekick. He is also paired or at least contrasted with Harris’ villain, who is as laid-back as Cruise is relentless. That’s the only way a villain has a chance against Cruise: to suggest a judo situation, in which all the hero’s energy will be turned against him. Best of all, Cruise is paired with Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa, an enigmatic mystery woman who might be good and might be bad. Either way, Ferguson’s aura of gravity — the way she seems to read Cruise and take him seriously — prevents us from seeing him as flighty. She is nothing like a Bond girl, yet another thing in this entertaining movie’s favor.",1
"The key to Beginners is its title. The structure is loose, shifting from the present to the recent past and to the distant past in ways that might seem random. Yet, in the experience of it, the movie's flow, feels logical and emotionally right because it's always developing a single idea. Beginners is the story of adults who are beginners at love but who are slowly, scene by scene, moving forward in their journey.Ewan McGregor is Oliver, a sensitive cartoonist who is, nonetheless, stunted in terms of relationships. Blame it on the family: His parents didn't quite connect, and when the mother dies, his 75-year-old father (Christopher Plummer) announces that he is gay and will live a gay life while he still has time.Writer-director Mike Mills gives us the timeline from the opening minutes and thereby injects a note of urgency. The mother dies in 1998, the father in 2003, so he has only five years to make a new life. In a similar way, when we see the mother (Mary Page Keller), as a youngish woman in flashback, we feel the limits of her life and that she will never know the love of her husband. It's through the prism of our godlike knowledge that we watch their scenes and understand their pain.Against this background, Oliver meets Anna (Mélanie Laurent), and he likes her even before he finds out she's French (the first night, she has laryngitis). He has intense desires for intimacy but a history of fleeing women when they get close. She is an actress who travels a lot and has had trouble maintaining connections. If he were more clingy, she would be afraid of him. If she were less elusive, he'd be looking for the exit. Instead, because they're both beginners, they're able to take some steps forward, together. But how far can they go?Laurent, often a cool customer, is as lovely and open here as she was in The Concert. McGregor makes an engaging locus for audience sympathy, as a sweet guy who runs the risk of never knowing love. We worry about him. As for Plummer, I don't know how he does it, but he somehow radiates gayness. It's nothing overt, just some internal shift, but if you saw only 10 seconds of Plummer in this film, you would know he was playing a gay man. You just might not know how  you know it.-- Advisory: Strong language, adult situations. Drama. Starring Ewan McGregor, Mélanie Laurent and Christopher Plummer. Directed by Mike Mills.

"The latest from writer-director Ira Sachs, “Little Men” is small in scale and rich in detail. When it’s over, its area of investigation is clear, that this is a movie about a friendship between teenagers and how conflicts between their parents affect its course. But in the experience of it, “Little Men” feels more like an unusually illuminating and satisfying glimpse into what might otherwise have seemed like a commonplace situation.The specifics are everything, starting with the kids, who are presented as distinct individuals in their own right but who together create a dynamic that is essential to both. Tony, whose mother is a Chilean immigrant, has a strong Brooklyn accent and is confident, warm and loquacious. In the way kids are drawn to each other, he becomes friends with Jake (Theo Taplitz), who is quiet, sardonic and observant. What they have in common is that both hope to be accepted to a high school for young artists — Jake for visual art, and Tony for acting.Soon they have something else in common, and it’s not a good thing: Their parents are heading toward a legal conflict, and the beauty of the screenplay by Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias is that neither side is entirely wrong. If anything, the side the audience expects most to sympathize with turns out to be the least attractive.The subject here is real estate in Brooklyn, a rare and lucrative commodity. As the movie begins, Jake’s father, Brian, becomes part inheritor of a building, left to him by his father. Is Brian a nice guy? He’s played by Greg Kinnear, which tells you all you need to know. Brian is married to a psychotherapist (Jennifer Ehle), who is very sweet and pays most of the family bills, because Brian’s acting career is stuck in that awful gray zone between modest success and actual money.The building has a tenant, a handmade-dress store owned by a dressmaker, but the rent she is paying is too low and can’t cover the building’s costs. Brian and his co-owning sister don’t want to throw the dressmaker out — their father was fond of her — but they don’t want to take a loss on their inheritance, either. So they try to talk to the dressmaker about raising the rent, and soon things start to get ugly.The dressmaker is played by Paulina Garcia, one of the great actresses of Chile, best known to Americans audiences for her vivid, full-bodied performance in “Gloria,” about a middle-aged single woman who loves to party. Here she’s quite strong playing a woman full of power and dignity, but also misdirected anger. The dressmaker is Tony’s mother, and soon the boys realize, to their astonishment and disgust, that their parents are at odds.It’s a virtue of “Little Men” that it stays small scale throughout. There are no gimmicks. It’s not spoiling anything to tell you that at no point in the movie does anyone pick up a gun. You could tell that for yourself within 10 minutes. The movie is as interesting as spying on your neighbors during the most interesting 85 minutes of their lives, as well as a sensitive look at what it’s like to be 15 years old and have no control over anything. It’s a very good movie, and I wish there were more like it.",1
"The surprise is that the idea, on the surface, seemed like the worst kind of arbitrary pop culture retread -- a retread of something that barely justified treading in the first place. George of the Jungle is based on the children's cartoon about a clumsy, Tarzan-like jungle man who swings on vines and keeps crashing into trees. But the predictable crashing motif is about the only weak element of George of the Jungle. The formula for children's films in recent years has been to steer the action to kids, while inserting a handful of sophisticated jokes to keep the adults sane and awake. George transcends that schizophrenic method. It's a lively movie with a playful attitude and a brisk, no-nonsense approach to nonsense. It's fun for everybody throughout the whole movie. Director Sam Weisman guides his cast to vivid comic performances. This goes not just for Brendan Fraser, who is bumbling and sweet as George, but for the supporting players as well. Thomas Haden Church is a scream as Lyle, the fatuous fiancee of Ursula (Leslie Mann), who becomes George's jungle mistress. He is condescending to the African guides, offering them cigars and trying vainly to dazzle them with a Polaroid camera. It's an irresistible takeoff of similar scenes from less aware jungle pictures. George's slow journey to romance begins when he rescues Ursula, a San Francisco heiress, from a lion. Ursula is actually a more competent jungle woman than Tarzan's Jane, who usually needed to be rescued at least once for every 10 minutes of screen time. Here, that one rescue lasts Ursula the whole movie. The jungle scenes have likable, imaginative touches. George's butler and best friend is an ape, whose voice is by John Cleese. George's dog is, in fact, an elephant who, through some sort of special effects magic, behaves just like a dog, twirling and scampering and aiming to please. It's all funnier than it has a right to be, partly because nothing (except for the crashing) is milked. George keeps moving. When the action moves to San Francisco, George of the Jungle finds new ways to be charming. The film becomes something like Splash, in which an innocent creature of nature is turned loose on the city streets. George discovers the biggest rope bridge he's ever seen, the Bay Bridge, and uses his vine-swinging technique to land himself on the six o'clock news. The San Francisco setting also puts George at a black-tie society party and into conflict with Ursula's iron-lady mother. Mrs. Stanhope is another of the film's strong character parts, played to the hilt by Holland Taylor. As Ursula, Mann is ditzy and adorable, and much the same could be said for the film. George of the Jungle is no classic, but given the premise, it's hard to imagine a better picture. ",1
"The title says it all. “The Fate of the Furious.” What is the fate of the furious? Hypertension? The title is deeply stupid, but more than stupid. It’s straight-faced stupid. It’s stupidity as done by people who are consciously aware they’re doing it and who have higher purpose, which is to raise stupidity to such a scale that it becomes epic, bold, glorious and confounding.This series is back. We know it from the first moments: Dominic (Vin Diesel) is ambling around Havana with a big smile on his face — Diesel has become the most smiley action hero since Douglas Fairbanks. He mediates a dispute between his nephew and some local tough guy by proposing that he, Dominic, race the tough guy in cars through the streets of Havana. The screenplay doesn’t even try to make sense of the proposal. It comes out of nowhere, apropos of nothing. But then comes the race, and it’s as good as any you could hope for. The villain is driving a hot rod. Dominic is in a beater, but he has hooked a tank of nitrous oxide to the engine. So the good news is that his car will go fast, and the bad news is that his car will definitely explode. The entire scene is ridiculous and crazy, inventively conceived and impeccably executed, so that even as you’re laughing at it, you’ll probably be on the edge of your seat.This is a major strength of this movie, starting from this scene and continuing through the finish: The action is not just big — big is easy. It’s creative. It’s choreographed. It’s unexpected and delightful. It’s lots of fun and a stark contrast to the previous film, “Furious 7,” which was huge but flat, just commotion without inspiration.The series has also recovered from the self-seriousness of the previous installment, which was probably inevitable given that co-star Paul Walker, who was in the original “The Fast and the Furious” from 2001, died midway through filming. “Furious 7” was rendered maudlin and creepy, as a computer-generated Walker kept turning up in scenes, smiling like he wasn’t really there — because he wasn’t.Now the series can go back to its true, silly nature. We meet Dominic, happy and smiling through life, enjoying a vacation with his wife (Michelle Rodriguez). But then — oh no — Cipher shows up, an international terrorist in the form of Charlize Theron, and she has something on Dominic, some kind of major leverage. We don’t know what it is, but next thing you know, Dominic has turned his back on his crew. He’s doing unexplainable and atypical things, such as stealing the nuclear codes from the Russians.It’s probably best to say it as one blanket statement, so as to not keep repeating it: Nothing makes sense here. Nothing. Cipher is supposed to be a genius, but she forces Dominic into her inner circle, the one man who can tank her operation. The Americans and the Russians are threatened by a dangerous terrorist, and so they leave the fate of the world in the hands of Dominic’s old crew, a bunch of racing enthusiasts. The list could go on and on, but the point has been made.Fortunately, “The Fate of the Furious” shows that absurdity can be a virtue. For example, for the big finish Dominic’s old crew has to be outfitted with new cars. So what does the government do? Supplying them with custom-made cars would be too easy. Instead the crew is taken to a secret warehouse that holds every car ever confiscated from a drug dealer. Yes, in the world of this movie, drug dealers are the ultimate curators of automotive excellence.About 70 minutes in, “The Fate of the Furious” slows down, and it seems as though it might never pull itself out. And then it does. The last half hour is nutty and completely satisfying. To be too specific would spoil things, so let’s just say that it involves a chase between a handful of cars and a submarine. No, you don’t need to read that sentence again. A handful of cars chase a submarine. You heard it here first. One more important point. Not everyone will notice this, because not everyone will recognize the cultural significance, but “The Fate of the Furious” constitutes a breakthrough for bald men. Four of the heroes — Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson — are hair free.And the villains? They have full heads of hair. It’s gross.",1
"The tone of “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” is the best thing about it and the hardest to describe. You might call it skewed, except that what often is called skewed is extreme and outlandish, while this movie is quiet and precise. It remains slightly but consistently twisted throughout, without ever backing off from its tone or slopping over into extremes. Yet every single thing is off. Colin Farrell plays a heart surgeon, but a heart surgeon who smokes. That’s unusual. Then in another scene, he’s still smoking, but he’s smoking another brand. What’s that about? And his anesthesiologist is smoking, too, so it’s not just an odd character detail. And people say odd things. A teenage girl meets a boy around her age, and the first thing she says is: “I just got my period for the first time.”From the sound of this, you might easily think that the goal of director (and co-writer) Yorgos Lanthimos is absurdism for its own sake, or maybe absurdism as some half-baked statement about the upper middle class. In fact, he’s after something a lot more interesting. He is creating a climate in which extreme things can happen and yet seem almost normal, without having to resort to having the soundtrack thunder into an echo chamber. It might even be a day or two after seeing it before it quite sinks in that “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” is a horror movie, and a particularly good one.It begins with soaring choral music underscoring the sight of a heart beating inside an opened-up chest cavity. Lanthimos lingers and lingers on the shot, so that we get through squeamishness and the strangeness of it and arrive at a place where the sight looks beautiful. Seconds later, we’re meeting the heart surgeon, and he’s so much less than the organ he works on, not as pure or perfect, but just a rather stiff fellow talking about wanting to buy a new watch.He meets up with a young man, a teenager named Martin (Barry Keoghan), and they have a conversation that, like all conversations in the movie, is a bit disconnected. We have no idea who Martin is in the surgeon’s life. The surgeon seems like a mentor of some kind, but he also seems anxious to keep Martin at a distance, and Martin seems determined to breach that distance, though his purpose is unclear. In “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” Lanthimos accomplishes something that would seem almost impossible, or at least very difficult. The bizarre disconnection that the surgeon has with the young man, he also has with his wife (Nicole Kidman) and two children, a boy (Sunny Suljic) and a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy). Lanthimos never breaks from this, never gets sentimental. Yet, somehow, he is able to create a sense, within the viewer, of anxiety concerning this family. He presents these cold, odd characters, who never stop being cold and odd, and yet he gets us to care about them.How cold? How odd? Twice the movie takes us into the couple’s bedroom, where their love life consists of her taking off her clothes and lying on the bed, pretending to be under full anesthesia. It’s one of the least appreciated things about Nicole Kidman, her career-long willingness to go to the place of weird.Precisely how “The Killing of the Sacred Deer” qualifies as a horror movie is best discovered in the viewing. But it should be said that Barry Keoghan’s ability to make his blue eyes go completely dead — to seem menacing even as he’s being mild, simply by the subtlest change in his manner of looking — is the acting marvel of this peculiar movie.

"The trailer for 50/50.Comedy-Drama. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen and Anna Kendrick. Directed by Jonathan Levine. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Right now comedy is where everything is happening in movies. Dramas are dramas, and action movies are lost in 3-D hell, but comedy filmmakers are trying new things, expanding the form to include bigger chunks of life, aspects of the human experience seemingly ineligible for comic treatment. And so we get 50/50, about a 27-year-old guy who gets cancer. Inevitably, it follows the usual pattern of Illness Epics: Hey, what's this pain in my back? Oh, it's probably nothing ...  But everything about the handling of the usual scenes is different, made palatable not by glossing over things with jokes but by staying human scale and true to the characters. For the record, I usually loathe illness movies even if they're well made, because who wants to spend two hours watching somebody get sick - unless they're getting something like leprosy or scurvy, which you probably don't have to worry about? But 50/50 will be liked and appreciated even by people who can't imagine wanting to see it.  Some moments are hard to take, such as the one of Joseph Gordon-Levitt waking up in the middle of the night following chemotherapy and throwing up in the bathroom. A few other scenes feel a trifle forced, such as the camaraderie that develops between the young man and two much older guys during their chemotherapy sessions. But for the most part, and to an impressive extent, 50/50 finds ways to be honest about something awful and yet appealing and watchable. In one scene, young Adam (Gordon-Levitt) eats some medical marijuana-laced cookies and then walks through the hospital where he is being treated. It's a chamber of horrors that would be terrifying to any sober person, but because of the filmmakers' strategy of making Adam stoned at this moment, the sequence works in a complicated, sophisticated way. We see what Adam is seeing, but we also see how he is seeing it, and his drugged capacity for distance at this moment becomes funny. Director Jonathan Levine and screenwriter Will Reiser do this throughout - they know what they have to show but figure out how to do so in imaginative and engaging ways.  50/50 is not about a fight for survival. The protagonist is more like a bystander to a fight being fought by his illness on one side and his body and the doctors on the other. He can do nothing but stand there and wait, the one person with everything to lose. Often dark onscreen, Gordon-Levitt has an open-faced probity that grabs the audience's interest and compassion. It's an interesting portrait in innate, unfussy dignity. Just as essential is Seth Rogen, as Adam's best friend. Rogen isn't even 30 yet, but he is already an important actor - not just because he's popular but because he best embodies this particular comic moment. He can be brash, vulgar, absurd, clueless, ridiculous and laughable and in the next minute be warm, unguarded, sensitive, humane and steadfast, without either side of his nature registering as inconsistent or less true. Instead, these contradictions are harmonized within the structure of Rogen's screen personality, which here and elsewhere - but especially here - hardly seems like his personality alone but emblematic of a generation. Anna Kendrick has a nice role as Adam's psychologist, a softening and an elaboration of Kendrick's role as a young careerist in Up in the Air, and Bryce Dallas Howard is Adam's girlfriend, who is not unlike the likable but superficial woman Howard took on in Clint Eastwood's Hereafter. Howard is too good at such roles, and too good for them. If she doesn't want to be playing such women for the rest of her career, she needs to stop now. ",1
"The trailer for Dark ShadowsHorror comedy. Starring Johnny Depp, Eva Green and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Tim Burton. (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It's difficult to pay tribute to something in earnest and yet spoof it at the same time. Err too far on the side of sincerity, and you have something that rings false. Take the satire too far, and you have a movie that's funny for 15 minutes and then meaningless for the next hour and a half.  But in Dark Shadows, Tim Burton and screenwriters Seth Grahame-Smith and John August get the balance right. They don't get it perfect. There are times, not too many, when the movie drags. But when you consider all the pitfalls avoided, and all the laughs and pleasures it provides along the way, Dark Shadows is a satisfying and skillful effort. One graceful touch is that they plow through all the intricate backstory in an entertaining pre-credits sequence that tells how Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) became a vampire. In fact, he deserved what he got: Dark Shadows can be seen as the story of a man whose unaccountable taste in women - he says no to Eva Green, who plays a witch - lands him in a coffin for 200 years.  When he is dug out two centuries later, the year is 1972, but Barnabas still talks as if it were 1770, or like Johnny Depp in half of his movies. He sees a car's headlights and thinks he is seeing the eyes of the devil. He sees a television set and believes that little people are trapped inside. You might think that the fish-out-of-water aspect might get old after two or three jokes, but Dark Shadows successfully taps that vein, so to speak, for the entire movie. Part of the success comes from the fact that 1972 is alien not just to him, but to us. So mixed in there is an early-'70s spoof, of the drugs and the counterculture, and of Wishnick dolls, lava lamps and board games. In one scene, in the midst of a self-pitying rant, Barnabas rests his head on what appears to be a piano. But no, it's an organ, of a type that was popular in that era, and his head triggers one of the device's recorded backbeats. So Dark Shadows works two kinds of comedy - comic dislocation and period satire. But wait, there's more. When Barnabas returns to his ancestral home, the lady of the house, his distant relation (Michelle Pfeiffer), makes him promise not to tell the rest of the household that he's a vampire. And so we get a perfect farce setup, in which the audience knows what's going on but most of the characters are only confused, as Barnabas picks up a fork and blithely remarks, Had this been real silver, my hand would have burst into flame at the slightest touch. All this comedy in constant motion makes it possible for Dark Shadows to concentrate on the plot mechanics only to the extent that they're interesting: Barnabas finds himself in an ongoing battle with Angelique (Green), who, being a witch, is eternally youthful and running half the town. These scenes between the fabulously confident Angelique and the dignified but easily rattled Barnabas are as funny as anything in the film. But this is also where the filmmakers inject a touch, the slightest touch, of seriousness. Angelique really is in love with this guy. She should get her head examined.  Depp has a lot of self-consciousness as an actor, but Barnabas is the most self-conscious of characters, and so the combination works. Green brings dimension to what might have been a one-note villain, and the rest of the cast is up for fun, including Helena Bonham Carter as the family psychiatrist. However, the resolution of the psychiatrist's story line feels extraneous and makes for the picture's one sour note.  The sets and atmospherics are up to Tim Burton's usual high standard - he usually gets those right - and the early '70s music on the soundtrack has never sounded better, even stuff you wouldn't expect, such as the Carpenters' Top of the World. When it came on, I found myself not wanting the song to end, and perhaps Burton felt that way, too, because he doesn't cut it off. He lets it play out.  Somehow the scene needed it. Who would have guessed?",1
"The trailer for Easy Virtue.Comedy. Starring Jessica Biel, Kristin Scott Thomas and Colin Firth. Directed by Stephan Elliott (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jessica Biel gets the 1920s glamour treatment in Easy Virtue, a comedy of manners based on the Noel Coward play. But it's a funny thing about style. Put this actress - acclaimed as one of the beautiful women of Hollywood - into marcelled hair and 1920s clothes, and something peculiar happens. She suddenly looks like Eleanor Roosevelt, with her wide mouth, prominent teeth and diffident air. The diffidence is new for Biel and probably has a lot to do with the company she keeps in Easy Virtue. Acting with heavy-hitters such as Colin Firth and Kristin Scott Thomas, Biel seems cowed. At other times, she overcompensates by flailing, as though finally letting loose to play a 1920s woman as just another strident gal from 2009. Biel never finds the balance between herself and the character, between complete naturalness and period style. Neither does director Stephan Elliott, which probably explains why he couldn't help her. Sometimes he approaches Easy Virtue as a straight adaptation and at other times he seems to be sending it up, observing the characters from a sardonic distance. And yet - and this is what makes this movie different from at least 90 percent of others that get off to a shaky start - Elliott recovers. Despite its director's little lapses in tone and judgment, Easy Virtue gets better as it goes along.  So does Biel, though it might not be anything she herself does. She plays an American widow, Larita, a racecar driver and 1920s adventuress, who marries into a wealthy English family. Her young husband (Ben Barnes), barely out of adolescence, brings her home to the family estate, where the mother (Thomas) instantly reviles her, and the passive father (Firth) immediately recognizes her as the real thing, as a woman of courage and integrity.  Biel owes a huge debt to Firth. With his sorrowful, truthful gaze, Firth eventually persuades us to see Larita as he sees her. It's Firth, far more than Biel, who serves up and explains Larita. He looks into her and sees deep life pain and strength and character, until we start . . . in fact, we never really see this in Biel, but we stop noticing that we don't see it. We believe he sees it. We believe it's there.  Until Easy Virtue deepens in that way, it's likable enough, with Kristin Scott Thomas playing up the comedy of the controlling mother, while keeping her within the bounds of realism and even audience sympathy. Katherine Parkinson and Kimberley Nixon also strike the right comic balance as Larita's cloistered, neurotic sisters-in-law. Only Biel lends the sour note. She blasts out of discomfort by giving into a familiar young actress' reflex, to convey strength through anger and outrage, and the director never tells her to cut it out. Elliott incorporates some of the zaniness of his breakthrough feature, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), into Easy Virtue, but it's an awkward match with Coward. Too often, he lets Marius De Vries' soundtrack comment sarcastically on the action, and in a dinner scene he indulges a too-cute trick of leaving the camera on a single shot for a long stretch, adjusting the focus as each character speaks in turn. Still, when it's time to get serious, Elliott gets there.  He understands the one essential thing: Firth is the movie. That character, a bon vivant who came back from World War I a sad, changed man, is the story's locus of meaning. His desperation is underneath the Jazz Age's surface gaiety. His horror is what's fueling the 1920s' decadelong spree. Horror is why people are doing crazy stunts, like dancing on biplanes. And horror is why Larita is driving fast.  Elliott had a choice in Easy Virtue, to turn away from the horror or face it. He takes his time, but he eventually does face it - and delivers up a good movie. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and female nudity. (No, not Biel. Calm down, this is embarrassing.)",1
"The trailer for Footloose.Musical drama. Starring Kenneth Wormald and Julianne Hough. Directed by Craig Brewer. (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The new Footloose does everything it needs to do. It's a vibrant youth musical that will appeal to audiences who haven't seen the 1984 original. And it has enough charm and life to it to compete with the memory of the earlier version. Director Craig Brewer is attempting a direct translation here, to make a new Footloose that means the same thing to today's audiences that the earlier Footloose meant to 1984. He's not trying to rethink it; he's just trying to replace the old parts, because the truth is, the old vehicle needed a tune-up. If you were to watch the original right now, you'd be surprised at how a movie remembered in its day as a shot of adrenaline is actually rather languorous. And the dance scenes that seemed so exuberant a generation ago? They're just OK. Newcomer Kenneth Wormald is not Kevin Bacon, but he's a better dancer and, like Bacon, he has the good sense not to play young Ren McCormack as the essence of cool. Ren is just a city kid who, following his mother's death, relocates to a small town in Texas to live with his aunt and uncle and finish high school. But because he's more worldly and comes from outside, he represents the fresh air of another perspective.  No sooner does Ren get to town than he gets a ticket for playing his car radio too loud, and he comes up against school authorities who say things like, I don't care what the rap music people say, marijuana is wrong. Half the town is proud to conform to narrow convention; the other half is exhausted at the prospect of fighting it. And Ren is the guy who comes in from out of nowhere and says this is crazy. He speaks for the audience.  In Footloose, the dusty old town has been made even worse by the recession. Gloom hangs over it, part economic in origin, and partly the result of a car accident a few years before that killed students coming back from a dance. In reaction to that, the town passed ordinances enforcing a curfew on minors and outlawing public dancing. Alas, the town's officials and even its pastor - played by Dennis Quaid with nary a twinkle - weren't up on their Genesis, or else they would have realized: As soon as you tell people what they absolutely must not do, that's all they want to do.  As the minister's rebellious daughter, newcomer Julianne Hough is a major asset. This won't come as news to anyone who saw the two-time Dancing With the Stars champion, but the young lady can dance. She also has a quality common to people who go on to big careers: She looks like five other actresses, but none in particular, and it feels as if you've seen her before, even if you haven't. Hough is 23 and plays an 18-year-old as if she were in her early 30s, bringing in notes of gravity, weariness, despairing recklessness and even self-disgust. Somehow it works.  Also not to be overlooked is Miles Teller, so somber as the troubled teenager in Rabbit Hole but here transformed into Ren's good ole boy best buddy. The chemistry between Wormald and Teller - they just look at each other and seem to click, even when their characters are clashing - is as important as that between Wormald and Hough. Every time Teller comes onscreen, the audience is smiling.  That a kid from Boston should seem like a Martian in small-town Texas feels more like 30 years ago than today, and film styles have definitely changed - shorter scenes, quicker shots, and the new Footloose reflects that. But so much has stayed about the same that the transplant from 1984 to 2011 is a breeze. Styles of dance haven't changed much, and Kenny Loggins' title song, which opens and closes the movie, sounds surprisingly alive after 27 years.  Imagine a 1984 movie, set in modern times, opening with a song from 1957. It could have never happened.",1
"The trailer for Il Divo.Drama. Starring Toni Servillo. Directed by Paolo Sorrentino. In Italian with English subtitles. (Not rated. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Giulio Andreotti, who turned 90 earlier this year, has been a fixture in Italian life for well over half a century - three times as prime minister, twice as defense minister and once as foreign minister. Il Divo is a dramatic film that concentrates on the events leading to a series of trials in the early 1990s, in which Andreotti was accused of having Mafia ties.  Andreotti is an enigmatic figure, impassive and cold, but with a penchant for creating sardonic aphorisms, such as Power wears out those who do not have it. Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino approaches his subject in a likewise spirit, recognizing this seminal politician's formidable position in 20th century Italian history, but presenting him almost as a figure of parody. It says something about the depth of Toni Servillo's performance that we very quickly see beyond the exaggerated mask - the stone face, the locked shoulders, the ears that fold down - to see the tormented, limited and potentially dangerous man underneath. As a director, Sorrentino has an affection for shooting from the ground up and for using slow motion to introduce subordinate characters, as though they were rival gunslingers in a Sergio Leone Western. His presentation of a series of Mafia murders best conveys his directorial personality: It's graphic and detailed, but with the suggestion that we're seeing just part of a whole panorama of human folly. One comes away with a sense of Sorrentino's disgust and also his distance, his very Italian dose of fatalism. For American viewers not thoroughly familiar with Andreotti (that's almost everybody), Il Divo is best appreciated as the bizarre character study of an essentially unlovable man who somehow became one of his country's most successful leaders. What did this nation, known throughout the world for its exuberance, see in this emotionless man? A highlight of the film - among several well-done, imagined set pieces - features Andreotti in an explosive confessional monologue, in which he explains why evil is necessary for good.  Other aspects will be lost on American viewers. I suspect, for example, that the cast of characters surrounding Andreotti are as well known to Italians as Haldeman, Erlichman, Mitchell or Dean. The vigorousness of the performers suggests that they're caricatures of people the audience already knows. Still, if Americans can't watch Il Divo with the same understanding as Italians, we can appreciate the film's perceptive dissection of a certain kind of public personality - one who craves the acceptance of people and the power to rule while somehow lacking the fundamental capacity to be a human being. -- Advisory:Graphic, disturbing violence.",1
"The trailer for Julia. Drama. Starring Tilda Swinton. Directed by Eric Zonca. (R. 144 minutes. At the Kabuki.)Tilda Swinton is a raving, out-of-control, promiscuous, pathetic, blackout drunk in Julia, the story of an alcoholic about 2 inches away from hitting bottom. For most movies, that simple setup would have been enough: Create a wild character, cast a top actress in the lead role and let her chew up every bit of scenery that's not nailed down.Swinton, certainly, has the appetite for the task. Her performance in the title role is theatrical and meticulously observed. She changes her talk, her walk, her whole manner of dealing with people, to make herself look and act like a whacked-out, aging party girl who thinks she's brilliant, but isn't, and who thinks she's still sexy, but she's dreaming. All that intelligence-wattage that we normally see in Swinton's face? She brings it down about 20 IQ points. But Julia is not content simply to provide a desperate protagonist and pace her through a series of humiliations on the way to the gutter. No, that would have been too easy. Instead, it weds this dramatic, over-the-top character and performance to a dramatic thriller plot, in which the alcoholic woman gets involved in a demented, get-rich-quick scheme. And the nature of the scheme? It involves packing a gun and kidnapping a child. Thus, a movie that could have been about the midnight of a soul becomes a nightmare involving gangs and ransoms and the drama of a woman, of limited intelligence and diminished faculties, trying to stay ahead of the game. The beauty of it is that Julia, for all its splendid plot machinations, never loses sight of Julia's personal journey. In a sense, it goes to all the places a sensitive character study might have gone, but more dramatically, convincingly and vividly. The film was co-written and directed by Eric Zonca, a name that might not ring a bell in these parts, though his debut film, The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), made a considerable splash on the art house circuit. This French director didn't make a feature until he was in 42, and his previous film was in 1999. Zonca doesn't rush out work, but everything he does is quality, and Julia is no exception. -- Advisory:This film contains nudity, sexual situations, violence and strong language.",1
"The trailer for Julie and Julia. Comedy-drama. Starring Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina. Directed by Nora Ephron. (PG-13. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Few movies are as delightful as Julie & Julia. Everything you've ever liked about Meryl Streep's invention, spontaneity and inspired silliness - and everything you may have ever loved about Julia Child's joy of life and singular eccentricity - come together in Streep's performance as the great American chef. Then there's the food, and the film's celebration of food ... and the sense of fellowship and good times that come with food ... and the lovingly re-created Paris of the 1940s and '50s ... At its best, this is an abundant, irresistible film.Written and directed by Nora Ephron, Julie & Julia gives us the improbable true story of a 40-year-old woman, with no previous experience, who discovered her gift and her passion for cooking - and went on to become the most influential American cook of the 20th century. Along the way, Ephron crafts a rare, detailed cinematic portrait of a happy marriage, in the depiction of Child's relationship with her husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci). In fact, if Julie & Julia focused entirely on the Julia part, it would be, without question, one of the best movies of the year. But there's another side to the movie, the Julie Powell side. Powell is a young New Yorker who gave herself the challenge of making, over the course of a single year, every recipe contained in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. You know, so she could blog about it.The movie intersperses scenes of Julia Child in midcentury Paris with scenes of Julie Powell in modern-day Queens, New York, and after an hour or so, the viewer may feel a tug of reluctance at leaving the Paris scenes and a sense of relief each time one of the New York segments is over. The reason hasn't to do with the atmosphere or location but with the character and personalities of the women. Child is a burst of joy, while Powell, as played by Amy Adams, is a churlish, ambition-driven opportunist.That wouldn't be a problem, except that the movie just assumes that Powell is a sympathetic figure. Then it goes about justifying the juxtaposition of the two women by finding shallow parallels between them. In fact, their differences in moral stature and achievement are staggering: Julia Child passionately applies herself in an effort to do something worthwhile and finally achieves a foothold in success after 13 years of hard work and setbacks. Meanwhile, Julie, piggybacking on the efforts of a great woman, tries to get famous by writing a blog - and succeeds inside a year. On the way to her book and movie deals, she whines, throws tantrums and puts her poor husband (Chris Messina) through utter hell. In one typically discordant moment, Julie Powell throws live lobsters into boiling water - what a charmer - because she's too squeamish to kill them before putting them into a pot. Believe it or not, that scene is played for laughs. Alas, it takes longer to explain the one thing that's off about Julie & Julia than to explain the many things that are right about it. In truth, by the time the movie is over, few people will be talking about the sourness of the Julie scenes, except in passing. They'll repress them. Instead, they'll be talking about Julia Child striding through a Paris open-air market, towering over everyone with her great height and buoyant spirit. (Streep is little more than average height, but every short extra in the world is in this movie.) And they'll be talking about the quiet moments between Julia and her kindly and supportive husband. Tucci is lovely in this. They'll also be talking about the wonderful lunch scene with Streep and Jane Lynch as Julia's sister. What a spectacle: Two expert screen comedians, each topping the other and working in hilarious harmony as they play these cheerful giantesses. This is fun, virtuoso, generous comic acting.And generosity is what Julie & Julia is about: the generosity of the earth and the generosity of effort required to make good food; the generosity of spirit that goes into a good dinner, and the generosity of investment that goes into a life's calling. It's about the recipe for the good life, how one woman finds it and how the other one couldn't, even with a map. -- Advisory: This movie has brief strong language and sensuality.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at afgate.com/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for Man on a Ledge. Drama. Starring Sam Worthington, Elizabeth Banks, Ed Harris and Edward Burns. Directed by Asger Leth. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Man on a Ledge doesn't aim high, but what it aims to do, it does. It grabs the audience's attention, engages its anxieties, stokes its resentments and, at the finish, sends people out saying, That was good. A year from now, no one will care about it or even think about it, but for right now, for this particular moment, this is a movie pressing the right buttons. The hard-to-resist premise would guarantee an audience in any climate: A falsely accused man (Sam Worthington), released from prison on a one-day pass, escapes, takes a room in a high-end New York hotel and steps out onto the ledge, threatening to kill himself. But the suicide threat and the traffic-stopping theatrics are just covers for something else, a high-risk, one-shot-in-hundred plan to exonerate himself before a live TV audience. Fine. Good enough. Sold: Hit thrillers have been made from lesser ideas. But the something extra at work here is the way in which Man on a Ledge plays on the anger the audience is already feeling. Who put our hero behind bars? Of course, it was a big businessman (Ed Harris), covering up his crimes. And who serves as the businessman's henchmen? None other than the government itself, represented here by a phalanx of corrupt police officers who know the truth but don't care - thugs who can murder with impunity. This is no place for a history lesson, but if you go back to the Great Depression, the top movie villains were businessmen and cops. In bad times, the individual - the man alone, on the ledge, with nothing to rely on but courage and the truth - counts for everything, and organized authority is looked upon with fear and suspicion. We're there again. The actors perform their important function of fleshing things out, taking a movie designed as an audience-pleasing machine and turning it into something human. Worthington has the right innate toughness, and he digs down to find the desperation to make sense of the character's actions, and Edward Burns is appealing as an almost jaded cop who still has a soul.  But the performance that lingers is that of Elizabeth Banks, as an officer specializing in talking down hostage takers and would-be jumpers. Banks knows she's playing a professional listener, and so she listens beautifully - watching and reacting with a natural empathy tempered by years of hearing lies. Banks, who was Laura Bush in W., deserves a role tailored to her specifications. In the meantime, she takes whatever they give her and makes it special, whether the role demands the harsh comic antics of Our Idiot Brother or the terror and despair of The Next Three Days. She makes Man on a Ledge feel as if it's her story.  The height effects are done with considerable care. Worthington was certainly never in danger during the making of the film, but the illusion of being high up is complete. It's aided by the fact that Worthington himself never acts like a man who feels safe up there. So we don't, either.",1
"The trailer for Public Enemies. Drama. Starring Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Michael Mann. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If Public Enemies lacks anything, it's something audiences can't legitimately expect to find: a certain extra something.  Public Enemies has everything else. Director Michael Mann has taken the story of John Dillinger, the notorious bank robber and Depression-era folk hero, and has made from it a drama full of dread and atmosphere, a 140-minute film that in no way seems long, that's a succession of compelling scenes, with no dead wood.  He has also rescued Johnny Depp from cliche. This time Depp doesn't play his own legend, or even Dillinger's. Instead, he digs past the surface to find the wellspring of Dillinger's anger and criminal genius.  The only thing Public Enemies lacks is the sense of a story bigger than itself. Mann takes on a great American subject, but with no desire to make a great American statement. A movie about the Great Depression, for example, could have had some special resonance during a bad recession, but the issues Mann explores here are personal to the characters. You remember how Bonnie and Clyde was about Bonnie and Clyde but also seemed, in a haunted way, about America in the 1960s and about the collision between youth and age and freedom versus conformity? Public Enemies is a movie about Dillinger that, days later, is still a movie about Dillinger. Accept that, and you'll be in a better place to appreciate Depp's best performance in years, perhaps in his career. That Depp is onto something special is apparent from the movie's first minutes, as we see Dillinger breaking out of prison on his first day under lockup. Depp gives us a Dillinger of many shadings, whose special talent is his uncanny understanding of human nature. This understanding makes him both impossible to incarcerate and a master of public relations. It also makes him irresistible to women - though looking like Johnny Depp doesn't hurt, either. Beyond that, Depp suggests that there's a part of Dillinger that Dillinger himself can never know - some deep place of longing that propels (but can never be fulfilled by) his criminal existence. Depp conveys this wordlessly, taking what might simply have been a good performance and raising it to an exalted level.  It's 1932, a time of bank failures and mortgage foreclosures. To a nation in panic, a fellow who goes around robbing banks seems more enterprising than criminal, and so Dillinger, the most wanted man in America, is able to hide among the people. But Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), head of the FBI's Chicago office, is closing in on America's public enemies. And J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) needs to resolve the Dillinger case in order to cement his status in Washington. Public Enemies can be watched as the story of three neurotic men. Dillinger has a screw loose, of course, but then so does Purvis, who, as played by Bale, is strangely bottled up and angry. And Hoover is the worst, talking and moving like a robot, a rigid and thoroughly inauthentic figure. What a shame it would be for a woman to get caught in that crossfire - and then one does: Billie Frechette, the hatcheck girl who becomes Dillinger's girlfriend.  Michael Mann is known as a tough guy director, but Public Enemies is more along the order of Mann's Last of the Mohicans, with a male-female relationship at its emotional center. French actress Marion Cotillard (La Vie en Rose), in her first major role in an English-language feature, loses nothing in the translation. She emerges as a powerhouse in the classic Hollywood tradition, with looks like Olivia de Havilland's and the attitude of Bette Davis. Pay close attention to the scene in which FBI interrogators beat up Billie. Cotillard, ferocious and vulnerable, has the complexity and transparency of a big star. Public Enemies deglamorizes Dillinger and his life as a public enemy. Though Dillinger is no villain, like the off-his-rocker Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham), he's no hero, and his life looks like a miserable series of near escapes and disappointing scores. This ennui threatens to infect the audience's experience, but then comes a genuinely great sequence, in and around the Biograph Theater in Chicago.  Most people who see Public Enemies will know exactly what happened there on July 22, 1934. Other films have portrayed that day, but Mann does something special with it: He uses the movie Dillinger went to see that night, Manhattan Melodrama, as an integral part of the sequence. Dillinger watches the story of a noble crook who meets a bad end. And Depp watches Clark Gable. Meanwhile, the law, untouched by splendor or imagination, waits outside. There are meanings here that transcend a prose description. Until that point, Public Enemies has been merely competent - strenuously, intelligently competent, but earthbound, all the same. But in the Biograph scene, Mann achieves poetry.More poetry would have been nice. Audiences, like Dillinger, always want more. But Public Enemies, better than about 90 percent of the movies that get released, is enough to keep all but the most greedy of us satisfied.  -- Advisory: Strong language, a sexual interlude and lots of graphic violence.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgte.com/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for Star Trek. Science fiction. Starring Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Leonard Nimoy, Eric Bana, Zoe Saldana and Karl Urban. Directed by J.J. Abrams. (PG-13. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)At this point, Capt. Kirk and Spock might as well have been real people. The emotions they incite are as strong as the ones associated with the most beloved historical figures, and the great thing about the new Star Trek movie is that the filmmakers know it. They knew it before the audience did.  So go in thinking Show me, and within five minutes your arms may be covered in goose bumps from watching the drama surrounding the birth of James T. Kirk. What, you don't care? That's what I thought. But watching Star Trek is like seeing the baby pictures of loved ones - or like being magically transported into the past to meet your parents when they were young and cuddly. In going back to tell the Enterprise story from the beginning, Star Trek presses collective emotional buttons people didn't even know they had. At its best, the effect is like seeing life panoramically, past and future, simultaneous and magnificent. Star Trek can't (or at least doesn't) maintain that level throughout. The pace drops, ironically, when director J.J. Abrams tries to pump up the energy, particularly in an extended sequence in which the young Kirk (Chris Pine) is chased by wild animals on a snow-covered planet. These creatures, like all computer-graphic monsters these days, have multiple mouths - that is, mouths inside of mouths, each with a row of teeth. That's one variety of animal that should be allowed to go extinct. But Star Trek always recovers itself, sometimes abruptly. It plays with our knowledge of the future Star Trek crew with sly introductions of the young Spock, McCoy, Chekov, Uhura, Scotty and Sulu. Only in retrospect does it even cross the mind that such introductions could have been cloying or dutiful. The movie takes pains to conceive the youthful incarnations of these characters with freedom and imagination.  So the young Kirk is a wise guy. Of course he is. He's still a wise guy today, doing commercials for Priceline - but wait, that's William Shatner, not Kirk. It all gets mixed together in the mind. As Kirk, Chris Pine doesn't imitate Shatner, but he evokes his confidence and breezy, jolly narcissism. At 10 years old, the young Kirk is taking the family car out for a joy ride, and as a young man, he's getting into bar fights. He has brains and nerve to spare, but he's going nowhere on Earth. Space is the answer.The Federation's headquarters for new recruits, incidentally, is in San Francisco. The skyline is entirely new, except for the Transamerica Pyramid, but the Golden Gate Bridge is still in operation. Cars fly in the 23rd century, so a bridge is superfluous, but this city cares about its landmarks.  Spock (Zachary Quinto) is a young man coping with his dual Vulcan-earthling heritage, trying to decide which side of himself to identify with. He goes in the direction of his ears. Karl Urban gets some of the movie's best laughs as Dr. McCoy, who is already an old man in spirit, complaining about everything and announcing, I am a doctor! every chance he gets.  The story of Star Trek involves a rogue Romulan, known as Nero (Eric Bana, made to look ugly), who has a plan: to destroy every Federation planet. He's the ideal Star Trek villain, in that he provides the Enterprise with plenty to do, but he never becomes the main focus of the movie's attention. In one particularly inventive turn of plot, the writers figure out a clever way to maintain these iconic characters for future sequels, while giving themselves license to diverge from accepted Enterprise history.Leonard Nimoy shows up as the old Spock, and he's not just there for a perfunctory blessing. He serves both a story function and an emotional function. At 78 (and looking not a day older than 79), Nimoy, just standing there, is a reminder of the passage of time and the glory of it all. He gives this new series a kickoff that it just might deserve.-- Advisory: Scenes of peril.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at afgate.com/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for Taking Woodstock. Comedy-drama. Starring Demetri Martin, Imelda Staunton, Jonathan Groff and Liev Shreiber. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Anyone familiar with the Woodstock documentary might recall several people saying, over the course of the three-day festival, that the concert has become a city. That impression, though spoken, was never quite conveyed in the documentary, but director Ang Lee captures it in Taking Woodstock, a true story based on the memoirs of Elliot Tiber, the man who found a home for the concert in Bethel, N.Y.In Taking Woodstock, the concert is so big that it's impossible to stand above it and grasp it all. You can only get a piece of it. It is, as one character puts it, the center of the universe, exerting an influence and a gravitational pull on everything surrounding it. The concert isn't one story but a million stories, and if you've ever wondered what it would be like to be there - to actually be there, man - this movie gets it. Or maybe it just gets the dream, but that's even better. Taking Woodstock has the appeal of an inside story told from an especially good angle. But beyond that, the movie is a celebration of the way this event has gone into memory and of the meaning it has acquired. Lee acknowledges this - that he's filming the memory, not the reality - by borrowing cinematic techniques directly from Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock documentary, such as the use of split screen and a certain predilection for Crosby, Stills and Nash on the soundtrack. Here and there, Lee makes use of a grainy film stock to give shots a rough-and-ready documentary feel. At one point, he shows the Woodstock cameramen filming the iconic shot of nuns walking into the concert, and he re-creates the famous scene of people sliding in the mud. In the process, he turns something that previously looked sloppy and drug-induced into something joyous. Throughout, Lee aims for a feeling - that specific sense that sometimes comes over us when we're young, of moving through a golden moment and knowing it. And so the scene in which our hero, Elliot (Demetri Martin), takes LSD in a van with a hippie couple, seems neither squalid nor dangerous, but rather like some warm and cozy rite of passage.Turns out, all this magic descended on a very unlikely place. At the start of the story, Elliot is working in his parents' disgusting, rundown motel in upstate New York. His parents are Russian Jewish immigrants - his father (Henry Goodman), passive to the point of inertia; his mother (Imelda Staunton), bitter, angry and greedy. Elliot is a beleaguered fellow, a dutiful son, but he has one claim to local fame: He's the guy in Bethel who has the right to issue permits. Nobody else wanted the job.So when he reads that the Woodstock festival has lost its permit in a nearby town, he contacts the promoters and invites them to Bethel. Overnight, his life transforms. Michael Lang (the guy with the big hair in the Woodstock movie, played here by Jonathan Groff) shows up with an entourage and bags of cash. Elliot's parents' horrible motel becomes the festival's base of operation, and into his life comes a series of vivid and free-spirited characters - including Liev Schreiber as an ex-Marine drag queen - who show him a bigger world. In real life, Elliot already knew he was gay and lived a gay life, but the movie - emphasizing the liberating effect of Woodstock - leaves Elliot's past experience vague. Much of the movie shows Elliot navigating between the old world and the new, dealing with the townspeople who resent the hippie invasion, and the hippies who are younger and freer than Elliot is. At times, the story feels a bit rote, and the movie suffers a bit from having such a passive protagonist, although Martin is an engaging actor. Fortunately, the movie grows as it goes along.There are two acting surprises in Taking Woodstock. The first is that it contains the first bad performance by Emile Hirsch. He plays a Vietnam veteran, and I believed him about as much as I'd believe my cat in the role. And the second is Eugene Levy, who excels in a relatively straight role as Max Yasgur, on whose farm the concert took place.-- Advisory: Nudity, sexual situations, lots of drug use.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for The Hangover.The Hangover Comedy. Starring Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha. Directed by Todd Phillips. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Hangover is the latest from Todd Phillips, a director who knows what men are really like. Other comedies present men in ways that are too crude or too sentimental, but Phillips - both in previous pictures (Old School, Starsky & Hutch) and this new one - has an instinctive feel for the truth. His honesty is what makes Phillips' movies hilarious, even when they're not consistently successful, and what makes The Hangover the funniest movie so far this year. Here's the truth about men: They are often prone to lewd, absurd, demented behavior, particularly when traveling in packs; and yet at the exact same time, men can be wildly romantic, in ways that are absolutely juvenile, yet weirdly soul nourishing. Another truth: Sometimes men, even married men (maybe especially married men), need to be around other men.  This is the latent subject and the wellspring of comedy in The Hangover, about four friends who go off to Las Vegas for a bachelor party ... and wake up the next morning with no recollection of what they did the night before. But there's a tiger in the bathroom and chickens are walking around the hotel suite, so something went haywire somewhere. An early scene carries the message: We meet Stu (Ed Helms), a thoroughly domesticated dentist, who is living with a woman (Rachael Harris) he plans to marry. She's a total shrew, angry and withholding, yet only a faint exaggeration of a type found in life. She thinks it's disgusting that he's going away with his friends - even though she thinks they're only heading up to Napa for an evening of wine tasting! The girlfriend's attitude is that men are just uncouth versions of women and need to behave. But obviously what poor Stu really needs is a weekend with the guys. What follows are two of the worst days imaginable that also look like two of the best days imaginable. Mild-mannered Stu meets up with his three friends. There's Doug (Justin Bartha), who is about to be married and doesn't want anything bad to happen to the Mercedes he borrowed from his father-in-law. (Uh-oh.) There's Phil (Bradley Cooper), a smooth operator, who feels trapped by domesticity. And finally, there's Alan, with Zach Galifianakis comically inventive as the mentally skewed brother of the bride, who was invited only as a courtesy. The Hangover is very funny from its first moments, funny not only in its situations, but in its dialogue. Phillips and screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore go for broke, with coarse humor and sight gags (one of the guys throws up during breakfast), all of it nicely grounded in character. These are average guys, not particularly cool or well-off, who are trying to have fun but have forgotten how, who are a few years past their last wild time. Then they wake up and Stu has a missing front tooth, Phil has a hospital bracelet around his wrist and Doug is missing. They had their fun ... and now comes the hangover. The search for the missing friend gives the guys a reason to stay in Vegas and gives the story the forward motion it needs. From there, the movie provides an escalating series of calamities and realizations, as the contours of a crazy night come into focus. Alas, some of the surprise of The Hangover has been undercut (not ruined, but dented) by the very funny coming attractions trailer that has played everywhere for months. If you haven't seen the trailer, avoid it; and your experience of The Hangover will be that much brighter.This comedy, though hysterically funny for over an hour, loses some steam in its last act. But it never comes close to derailing and never does the fatal thing of becoming dishonest and sappy, as so many comedies (and all sitcoms) do. Maybe the audience gets exhausted from laughing.  Throughout, the filmmakers resist the temptation to go too far, either into flat-out tastelessness or into perilous plot turns. Just when they seem they might, they always pull back, and that's good. After all, The Hangover is not about anything truly horrible, but rather about the kind of seemingly horrible time that makes for great memories. -- Advisory: Nudity and coarse language.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts",1
"The trailer for The Ides of March.Drama. Starring Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Evan Rachel Wood. Directed by George Clooney. (R. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)There is no point in discounting smart, engrossing entertainment like The Ides of March, though it's hard not to notice when a film that could have been great falls short. This latest from George Clooney - he co-stars, co-wrote and directed the picture - is almost a political drama of the caliber of Gore Vidal's The Best Man, but it's not quite. However, it is the movie to recommend to adults looking for something that's topical and intelligent and that will keep them guessing. Based on the play by Beau Willimon, who worked in political campaigns, it tells a story of politics as seen from the inside. The Ohio Democratic primary is a week away, and the nomination has come down to two candidates, one of whom is a liberal governor played by Clooney. He has two men leading his staff, a sort of Carville-Stephanopoulos combo - a midcareer war horse (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a young brainiac (Ryan Gosling).  Gosling is at the center of the movie, a sleek, tailored, self-assured young man, clearly shrewd and capable enough to handle anything, from logistics to strategy to media relations. Gosling has all that coming through the door, and it's an asset to the role.  But there is one aspect to the character that Gosling can't quite nail down, that might simply be outside his sphere, which is idealism. He may just be too cool a customer. Thus, a character that should have been, in part, a true believer comes off as a cynic from his first moments. Interestingly, Hoffman somehow conveys a strain of sincere passion underneath all the layers of disillusionment and disappointment.  Perhaps Gosling's coolness in the role was Clooney's idea, as director. If it was, it wasn't a good one. But then Clooney had his own role to worry about, and once again there's something fuzzy and conflicting in the presentation. His governor seems weak, but weak in an ambiguous way, in that he looks flimsy when Stephen (Gosling) is most impressed by him. Even when the movie is over, you can't be sure if this was Clooney's intention or if he just couldn't get his politician act down.  The Ides of March has an effective opening, sags in the middle, then comes back strong in the last half hour. The shifts and turns of the film have all to do with the various political machinations of the characters - including Paul Giamatti at his feral best as the opposing candidate's manager - but there's no point in revealing any of that here. Suffice it to say that the story is exceptionally well plotted, and just its unraveling is a pleasure to watch. One element that should be mentioned, however, is the romance between Stephen and a 20-year-old intern (Evan Rachel Wood). Again, we find a missed opportunity, in that both characters are so distant that their interactions seem to mean nothing, even though that relationship is expected to pack emotional heft later in the film.  So that's the odd thing about The Ides of March: Without changing a word in the script, but by merely tweaking the performances in the direction of drama, the movie could have had considerably more impact. Really, it should have been easy: Have Gosling play it like he cares. Have Clooney look like he'd make a good president. Have Gosling and Wood look like they love each other.  Perhaps Clooney never quite realized that he had an old-fashioned story on his hands. The Ides of March has a statement that is modern, but its dramatic structure is that of an old chestnut, and it needed to be directed accordingly, with the emotions jacked up. As it stands, the movie works in a Yeah, that was good sort of way. There was more in that script to be had. ",1
"The trailer for The Orphan. Thriller. Starring Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard and Isabelle Fuhrman. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. (R. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)So sloppy, so lowdown, so shameless and so entertaining, Orphan provides everything you might expect in a psycho-child thriller, but with such excess and exuberance that it still has the power to surprise. From the opening scene - a stillbirth that looks like a bloody homage to David Cronenberg - to its protracted, violent, demented climax, Orphan is a two-hour nervous breakdown. Even when it's laughable, even when it's illogical and even when it's predictable, it's still unsettling. Its impact comes from the sense, communicated early on, that Orphan is willing to take the audience a little further than it expects to go, or even wants to go. In one corner of the ring, we have two hapless yuppies in a shaky marriage. Mom (Vera Farmiga) is coming off a drinking problem, with less than a year of sobriety, and Dad (Peter Sarsgaard) is clueless and inert, with an eye for other women. Still not recovered from a stillbirth, and with two young children - a snotty young son and an adorable deaf daughter - they somehow settle into the delusion that they're stable enough to adopt an older child from Russia.In the opposite corner, we have Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), little Miss Perfect in a dress, who is mature, well-spoken and artistically inclined. Just going in, the adoption looks like a bad idea. Even without being evil, Esther is smarter than both her adoptive parents combined, so we know this is a terrible mismatch. But Esther is evil. How evil? Remember the little girl in The Bad Seed? Nice kid, come to think of it.  As in House of Wax, director Jaume Collet-Serra had to take a formulaic story in a familiar genre and deliver a compelling, amusing movie. That's not easy. As in the earlier film, Collet-Serra succeeds in Orphan not through any extraordinary visual gift but through an instinct for audience psychology. He builds sequences with care, lavishes time on the characters and makes absolutely sure that viewers don't just mildly dislike Esther but want to rip her to shreds. Mom's not crazy about her, either. Farmiga (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas) once again explores the outer reaches of maternal extremity as the family Cassandra, a mother who knows, just knows, that there's something seriously wrong with her adopted daughter. But no one will take her seriously, including her useless therapist and her even-more-useless husband. Farmiga thrives in the role of audience surrogate.  Sarsgaard, though, has trouble. His familiar tired-voice-of-reason persona is an odd choice for the playing of an untrustworthy husband who has bad judgment and complete conviction. Sarsgaard would have done better to channel his inner William Shatner to play a man who is, in essence, a charming, confident empty suit. As it stands, his character exists in a bland gray zone between sympathetic and ridiculous, and Orphan is no movie for gray zones. In any case, Isabelle Fuhrman, as Esther, steals the show. The more we learn of Esther, the more we realize how much this child actress brings to the character's moment-to-moment responses and interactions. Esther is not just a piece of work, but a detailed piece of work. Fuhrman injects nuance into this portrayal, as well as an arch spirit. Pay attention, for example, to how Esther's Russian accent slides from imperceptible to thick and menacing over the course of the movie.  There's no reason for that, except to do something fun. The same could be said for making - and going to see - Orphan. -- Advisory:Strong language, sexual situations, blood and violence.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3.Suspense drama. Starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta. Directed by Tony Scott. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Every movie involves two realities, the one onscreen and the one in the theater, and the interplay between the two is sometimes dynamic. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 has all the usual virtues of a good action suspense drama, but it lacks that extra something - that context, that vital interchange - that made the original The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 such a memorable experience in 1974. So, an evil mastermind decides to hijack a subway train and hold up the city of New York for an enormous ransom. Today, we watch and think, sure, that could happen. There are bad people in the world, and anybody could become the victim of some random, senseless act of violence.  But in 1974, this premise was received in a much different way, not as an outlandish scenario that could happen but as a variety of madness that probably would happen, sooner or later, because everything was falling apart. You know the litany: Vietnam. Then Watergate. New York City was going broke. Just getting into a subway car was dangerous, even without kidnappers or hostage takers. Back then, civilization seemed to be heading off a cliff, and New York, always on the cutting edge of fashion, looked destined to hit bottom first. Thus, The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 was more than a suspense drama in 1974; it was a vision of urban apocalypse.  Today we have our own visions of the apocalypse - terrorism, civic catastrophe, economic collapse - and this new Pelham might have gotten some extra juice had it tapped into those. But the remake eschews the social context that made the original so compelling. Instead of a terrorist for a villain, or someone equally mysterious, the movie gives us a lone nut and his small band of thugs.  (Pelham even guesses wrong: When a character tries to manipulate the stock market, we look at his laptop to find the Dow Jones at 12,000. It can't be scary if our own apocalypse is bigger than their apocalypse.)  Still, despite some odd choices on the part of the filmmakers, this remake works out better than one might expect. For example, picture John Travolta playing a mentally unbalanced, emotionally erratic homicidal maniac. Then go to Pelham and be surprised. Travolta does not go into his charming bag of tricks. He doesn't smile or laugh (or even scowl like the guy in Pulp Fiction). In fact, on three occasions, I had to remind myself that this was Travolta. He takes a baseline pretty-good movie and, through sheer conviction, makes it a little better than that. So does Denzel Washington. He plays the transit officer manning the controls for that sector of the New York subway system, who's the first to make contact with the hijacker (Travolta). Washington lends the character a specifically New York type of working man's diffidence - he's a regular guy way over his head, forced to improvise - and we watch him grow, not in confidence but in moral authority. This is strong, convincing character work.  Credit some of that to Tony Scott. He's a director known for his bombast, and rightly so, but unlike the overbearing generation of Tony Scott imitators that have taken root in the past 20 years, this director never forgets the human element. He grounds his action in personality and builds action sequences skillfully, without relying on that shaking-the-camera idiocy that wrecks half the action movies we see each year.  Screenwriter Brian Helgeland had the concept to turn Pelham into an elaborate two-person dance between the hijacker and the transit worker, with the idea being that these guys, despite their differences, aren't so far apart. Helgeland's idea of hero and villain both inhabiting a moral gray area seems like a relic from the relativist 1990s, and isn't an ideal match for this material. Yet there's no denying that this is a good writer, working with a good director and two inspired charismatic actors, and together they come up with something interesting and compelling, on its own terms.  Pelham might even be cause for enthusiasm if there weren't a better movie, with that exact same title, already available everywhere.-- Advisory:Strong language and very harsh, nasty violence.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for The Time Traveler's Wife. Romantic drama. Starring Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams. Directed by Robert Schwentke. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)It would really help to get into the right frame of mind before seeing The Time Traveler's Wife, because viewed from some angles - maybe most angles - the movie is ridiculous.As a time-travel movie, it's a bust, because our hero only gets to visit a small span of history (about 40 years), has no ability to alter events and has no particular interest in any of the places he sees. As a movie dealing with a scientific phenomenon, it's disappointing, in that it violates its own logic in a number of places. And simply as a spectacle, the movie flirts with becoming unintentionally funny: The gimmick is that each time our hero (Eric Bana) gets zapped to another time and place, he arrives naked.Take those elements and add in something else - a tone of absolute, mournful super-seriousness - and you have a ripe target for satire. Still, anything earnest risks being mocked, and the reflexive irony of our time is nothing to brag about. The truth is, The Time Traveler's Wife, in its clumsy way, does something significant. It takes, as its subjects, the sadness and grandeur of life and the mystery of time, and it offers a full experience to those who find its wavelength. Time travel is a natural topic for movies. Take a moving picture camera and point it at anything, absolutely anything. Then wait a year or two, or 50 or 100. Eventually, those images will become heartbreaking to somebody. It's the nature of the medium. In the same way, The Time Traveler's Wife makes us aware of the ephemerality and preciousness of all things. So a boy is in a car with his mother in the opening scene, and they're talking about nothing in particular - always a bad sign. It means, you guessed it, a fatal car crash is on the way. Mom is killed, and the boy survives. He's on the street moments later, shocked and grief stricken, when Eric Bana suddenly materializes. He tells the boy that he is him, as an adult, and that everything is going to be all right. So in a matter of 30 seconds, the boy loses his mother but finds out that he'll eventually look like Eric Bana. Call that breaking even.For Henry (Bana), time travel is an affliction. Like everyone else, he moves through life one moment to the next, but every few days or weeks he is involuntarily detoured, sent catapulting back to an earlier or later period. This is the given, and the strength of the movie is how much emotion it can wring from that simple premise. There's a scene, for example, in which Henry finds himself on a Chicago subway train some time in the early 1970s. He looks over and sees his mother (Michelle Nolden) sitting there reading the paper - on some random commute on some forgotten day. The scene that follows is simple but beautiful. Most of The Time Traveler's Wife deals with the relationship between Henry and the woman he marries, Claire, who's played by Rachel McAdams. Based on the novel by Audrey Niffenegger, the film is less interested in the specifics of time travel than the effect time travel might have on a marriage. McAdams undergoes the biggest transformation, calibrating Claire's journey from hopeful girlhood, to romantic young womanhood to middle-aged doubt, fear and disappointment.But it's Bana who carries the film's emotion. He's aided enormously by Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay - the author of Ghost and Jacob's Ladder is a natural for this material - and by a director, Robert Schwentke, who knows when to put the camera on Bana's face and leave it there. I used to assume that Bana was just a handsome guy, which is reason enough that he should be in movies. But two weeks ago, Funny People proved he had something more going on, and now The Time Traveler's Wife defines what that something is. Just look at him in those close-ups in which he lies: He knows the truth, he knows the future, but he decides not to burden the other person with this terrible knowledge. In those moments, he doesn't move a muscle, but his eyes just ... change. They darken, literally.This is not an intellectual talent, and this is no acting trick. This is a guy who has an ability to open up, to be unguarded, to feel something without getting in his own way. Among actors, this ability is uncommon. Among male heartthrobs, it's almost unheard of.-- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and violence.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for Year One. Comedy. Starring Jack Black and Michael Cera. Directed by Harold Ramis. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Dawn-of-time music thunders portentously from the soundtrack as a band of primitive hunters track down a wild boar. For about 30 seconds of Year One, we could be watching a drama - or something even more ridiculously straight-faced and somber, such as a historical re-enactment in a TV documentary. And then one of the hunters screws up, badly, and we meet Jack Black as Zed, an overly confident, loudmouth caveman who somehow can't find his place in prehistoric culture.  Year One has one joke, but it's a good one, played for many variations over the course of an often very funny comedy: It's the contrast between the modern sensibility embodied by Black and Michael Cera and that of a brutal, early period of history. The comedy turns on the spectacle of a pair of modern-seeming people who keep finding that their best attributes - wit, sensitivity, loquaciousness, inventiveness - are completely useless in a world in which courtship consists of hitting a girl over the head with a club and dragging her back to the hut. Black and Cera's comic styles are quite different. Onscreen, Black's persona tends to be self-promoting and easily exasperated, a character in constant collision with his environment, who acts before he thinks and tries to get by on bluff. Cera, by contrast, is watchful and paranoid, sardonic and full of dread, and thinks hard before he commits himself in any direction. These contrasts make them a superb comic duo, and so does their one similarity: They both operate under the implicit assumption that the world is a threatening place that must be mastered, either by forceful action (Black) or careful thought (Cera).  Actually, Black and Cera have something else in common: They are both very skilled, very precise comedians. In the case of Black, this is well known, and in the case of Cera, it's no surprise, considering his performance in Superbad. Still, it's a striking thing to find a 21-year-old actor with such self-assurance, such innate timing and such a thorough understanding of himself as a screen entity. Even Buster Keaton and Chaplin didn't really get under way until they were about 25. Director Harold Ramis, who wrote the story and co-wrote the screenplay, never lets Year One settle. He keeps the plot moving, introducing new elements and finding new opportunities for comedy. He mines each environment for laughs and moves onto another, and he doesn't worry about anachronisms. And so the two cavemen, presumably living about 20,000 years ago, come down from the mountains and run into the farmers, Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd). Soon we find ourselves in early biblical times, with Zed and Oh (Cera) running into Abraham (circa 2000 B.C.) at a crucial moment. We are the Hebrews, Abraham announces, righteous people, but not very good at sports.  Abraham tells them about Sodom and Gomorrah, which he describes as horrible cities in which people drink and celebrate all day, and where the women are so licentious that sex is given freely, to anyone, just for the asking. Watch Black's face as he hears this description. His eyes practically roll up into his head as he tries to figure out how to politely ask for directions.  Year One is not always laugh-out-loud funny, but it's always lively. After 30 years of writing and sometimes directing some very fine comedies (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, Animal House, Stripes), Ramis knows exactly what it takes to hold an audience's attention in comedy. Every character is made vivid and absurd, from the breezy but wicked Cain, to the righteous but oblivious Abraham (who thinks everybody should want to be circumcised), to the flamboyant (and hirsute) high priest of Sodom (Oliver Platt).  Ramis never lets his guard down, never gives the audience a chance to relax, even if it means hanging a lead character upside down and making him urinate on his own face. There's no vulgar or not vulgar here, just funny or not funny. Year One shows what has been true since the beginning of time: that it's anything for a laugh.-- Advisory: Sexual situations and crude humor.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate/podcasts.",1
"The trailer for the film Up. Animation. Starring the voices of Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai. Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson. (PG. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are scenes in Up of such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments - and this is already apparent today, on the morning of the film's release. As was the case with WALL-E, Up shows that, for Pixar, progress is not just a technological matter. It is moving forward in artistry, cultivating realms of wordless splendor that evoke the best of the silent days. Yet Up also contains boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction that test the ability of any adult to stay conscious. WALL-E was like that, too, and like WALL-E, Up has a moving opening and a satisfying finish, but too much dull stuff in the middle. The movie more than survives - it even thrives - but that extra padding, there as a concession to kid-movie formula, should have been tightened up or thrown out altogether.  So Up finds Pixar at a fascinating juncture, still testing the deep waters of profound content while keeping a toe in the wading pool of children's entertainment. From a commercial standpoint, this might be an ideal combination, and from a critical angle, the reflexive approbation that Pixar receives hardly leaves room to consider that it might go beyond past achievements. Then again, these people are artists, and, as artists, they have to be able to tell that the first 15 minutes of Up are at masterpiece level - and that some of the middle scenes, involving chases and talking dogs, are just marking time. Those first glorious minutes begin some time around 1940. A shy boy, Carl, meets a rambunctious tomboy who dreams of adventure. She's bursting with life force, and for a few minutes, we think that the film might stay in this earlier period. But then in a sequence that's just breathtaking, the decades fly by. The boy and girl grow up. They marry. They move into a house. They get middle-aged. We see her tightening his tie, and then - in a lovely touch that any silent master would have envied - we see a succession of ties, in varying styles, one blending into the other, indicating the passage of years.  By the end of the sequence, Carl is alone, cranky and arthritic, riding down his staircase in an automated chair - an old man with a wonderful love story in his past that no one wants to hear about or would even guess at. Ed Asner is the voice of Carl, an ideal choice. Asner's grumpiness has never been truly grumpy, just the protective stance of a private, sensitive person. He lends that quality to Carl. The story kicks in when Carl, feeling the world closing in, attaches thousands of helium balloons to his house and takes off, still inside, for South America. A chubby young Boy Scout (voice of Jordan Nagai) comes along for the ride, and soon after their arrival, they meet a great old explorer (Christopher Plummer), once Carl's childhood hero. Up flags in this midsection, becoming stuffed with riffs involving the explorer's pack of talking dogs. The movie loses propulsion, probably because the character of Carl, for most of the movie, lacks a particular drive.  Still, to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout: The armchairs where Carl and his wife once sat every night, the wife's childhood scrapbook and even the house itself - these all become powerful images. Directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson are not simply animators on the cutting edge, but filmmakers working within an artistic tradition that goes way beyond Disney to include names like Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Ernst Lubitsch. At their best, they're a lot more than good. The ideal Pixar film would consist of nothing but the very best moments - it would be filled wall-to-wall with genius. I know, that's so easy to say. But fine, say it's impossible for any Pixar film to maintain that exalted level for an entire 96 minutes. Would it be so terrible to release a near-perfect 40-, 50- or 60-minute film, in combination with other Pixar shorts?  Pixar has the attention and goodwill of the world, after all. It doesn't have to worry about standard feature length but can take this art form any place it wants. -- Advisory:Wholesome family entertainment.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgste.com/podcasts.",1
"The way it usually works with screen comedies is that they get a funny guy and a straight guy and pair them off, but “Get Hard” breaks the pattern. It matches up two comic actors and instead of clashing or canceling each other out, they bring in the best possible result: A comedy with twice the laughs. “Get Hard” is funny — funny as in, if you’re eating something in the theater, be courteous and try not to spray the people in the seats in front of you. Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, comedians of vastly different sizes and speeds, somehow find their way into each others’ rhythms, and the result is a memorable collaboration. As for the movie itself, it’s a laugh machine, nothing more than that, but that’s enough. All laugh machines should work this well.The comic gimmick, the initial premise, is surefire going in, and then the filmmakers modify it and make it better: James (Ferrell), a white stock trader about to go to prison for white-collar crime, hires Darnell (Hart), a black ex-con, to toughen him up so he can survive prison. But not exactly. Darnell isn’t really an ex-con. James is so racially oblivious he just assumes that he is, and Darnell needs the money and is willing to help.The filmmakers make a series of smart decisions. James is, of course, desperate, which is ideal — extreme emotions are always good for comedy — but Darnell also cares. He’s not taking the money and running. Rather he sees this poor guy just days away from guaranteed annihilation, and he wants to do something to give him a fighting chance. Subtly, not in a way anyone would notice without looking for it, the movie switches back and forth, giving each comedian a chance to be the funny one and the other to lend support. For example, when Hart has an extended comic bit when he acts out what James should expect in the prison yard, Ferrell plays along. In another scene, James practices trash talk, so he’ll know how to tell people off while in the big house. But his variety of cursing is so bizarre that Darnell just sits there stunned, not knowing how to react.Like most comedies these days, “Get Hard” is harsh and goes to the edge of the R rating with moments that are close to shocking. At one point, Darnell, despairing of being able to help James, decides that James’ only chance of surviving prison is to learn how to perform fellatio. So he takes him to a gay hangout, and what follows is a men’s room scene that goes about as far as a comedy can go. The movie plays with racial and sexual stereotypes in a knowing way. The days of the PG comedy, in which the audience is ahead of the filmmakers, are over, at least for now. There’s a scene with white supremacists — James needs their protection before he goes to prison — and another in which James almost joins a black gang. Ferrell and Hart are good actors in addition to being funny, so neither is uncomfortable holding still while the other gets the laugh. They listen to each other. They play off each other. They ground everything they do in terms of character, and the laughs proceed from there. At times, it seems as though they might be improvising. There’s something vital in their creative chemistry, like they know they have to bring their best game, or is it that they’re just pleased to be working with an equal?“Get Hard” is probably a one-off, in that the story makes it difficult to imagine a sequel. But someone ought to figure out a way for Hart and Ferrell to keep working together.",1
"The world is always present in the films of Sally Potter, waiting outside, guiding and influencing the lives of people within her specific and intense gaze. And so it is in “The Party,” her confident and economical chamber piece, a full and satisfying experience that clocks in at only 71 minutes.The occasion for celebration is the election of Janet (Kristin Scott Thomas), who has become a minister of Parliament and the shadow minister of health. That is, she will be the health minister if her political party comes into power. As Thomas can often seem, she is a study in competence, integrating visitors and congratulatory phone calls into a steady stream, while chopping onions and preparing dinner.But something doesn’t feel right. Although the party should be a happy one, an aura of defeat and disappointment hangs over the house. Her closest friends — played by Patricia Clarkson and Cherry Jones — can’t conceal a certain ambivalence about Janet’s elevation. Meanwhile, Janet’s husband, Bill (Timothy Spall) sits in the living room with a zombie-like expression, as if stricken by the realization that he’s about to become Margaret Thatcher’s husband.As you can tell already, Potter (“Orlando,” “Ginger & Rosa”) has attracted a strong cast, and that strength extends to all the roles. Emily Mortimer plays Jones’ pregnant lover, who announces triumphantly that she is having triplets — and expects this to be greeted as good news. Cillian Murphy is an Irish investment banker, who looks swell in his expensive suit, but keeps running into the bathroom to snort cocaine. And best of all, there’s Bruno Ganz as Gottfried, looking as loony-radiant as Timothy Leary as he spouts new-age bromides.The untold story we've all been waiting for is almost here.Shot in a glossy, appealing black-and-white and filmed in a single location, “The Party” generates a pressure-cooker atmosphere. The characters’ clashing grievances bespeak an underlying middle-aged and late-middle-age despair, the sense of people carrying on despite an uneasy sense that there is no point. Considering that the characters are all professional altruists, this encroaching nihilism suggests a larger significance. There’s something wrong, not just in the room, but outside.This feeling is not easy to explain or define. If it were, there might have been no need for Potter to express it through art. But its overall sense is that something is giving way, that the civility with which these people live their lives and the reality that they have assumed are simply not adequate to the challenges outside their doorstep. The world is caving in, and the strain of pretending otherwise is starting to show.",1
"The writing was never a problem in Rebecca Miller’s movies, but it has taken a while for her to become a director. Her earlier films, such as “The Ballad of Jack and Rose,” had many good scenes, but they didn’t cohere or land with any accumulated impact. “The Private Lives of Pippa Lee” (2009) was a strong step forward for Miller, but her new film, “Maggie’s Plan,” is a step beyond that. She’s a genuine director now, not just a writer who directs, and it’s officially time to start looking forward to Rebecca Miller movies.Her achievement in “Maggie’s Plan” has many aspects to it, but they boil down to two — how smooth and easy it all is, and how messy and wrong it might have been.It’s a story with several shifts in time and mood, with characters whose ambitions, affections and motives change, almost without warning. But at no point does the viewer ever feel lost, left behind or pushed into some unearned perception. The film could have seemed clumsy, and it’s anything but. There’s also a lightness in the tone that yet allows for real emotion and impressive performances. “Maggie’s Plan” doesn’t quite transcend the limits of the romantic comedy genre, but it pushes at them.At the center of it all is Greta Gerwig, who radiates niceness and authenticity, even as she is playing a character that could be easily misperceived as a control freak. At the start of the film, Maggie has given up on the idea of finding a lifelong partner, but she knows she wants a baby. She also knows the sperm donor she wants — a mathematician turned pickle entrepreneur (Travis Fimmel). Even as she is planning that, she is trying to fix the life of a professor at the New School, a ficto-critical anthropologist who aspires to be a novelist. John (Ethan Hawke) is a married man, with a high-powered academic (Julianne Moore) for a wife, and Maggie becomes his chief reader and cheerleader. It would be so easy, and so wrong, to think of Gerwig as merely a charming personality, someone quirky and appealing, who just stands in front of the camera and acts like herself. Actually, she’s brilliant. Take a look at the long close-up during which Maggie talks to John about her parents. Gerwig seems to be acting five things at once, experiencing sadness, humor, a desire to connect, regret and conflicting impulses to reveal and conceal. But what she’s really doing is getting out of her own way and experiencing all the richness of the moment, and letting us see it, in all its complicated emotionality. Not everyone can do that, nor can they build, from what might have seemed a character of erratic impulses, a portrait of emotional courage. Gerwig — and no doubt, Miller — makes Maggie into someone with an uncomplicated yet sophisticated capacity to know what she feels, to admit what she feels and to act on her feelings. This makes her a little like a child, but wise.It also makes Maggie someone who maybe should be planning other people’s lives. Over the course of “Maggie’s Plan,” Maggie improvises her own course and those of others, and as the movie goes on, the filmmaker’s relationship with the whole notion of planning isn’t simple. While the characters onscreen keep insisting that some things can’t be planned, the movie seems to be arguing something else — that making a grand design for your life is possible, but only if you’re able to face what you want and accept the consequences.

"There are lot of bigger and shinier packages under the movie Christmas tree, but The Gambler doesn't deserve to get lost under there. Most of those packages don't amount to much, anyway, while The Gambler is quite a good movie - not exactly Christmassy, not exactly with a feeling of event about it, but definitely something to look for come Dec. 26 and 27.The film is a remake of the 1974 Karel Reisz movie of the same name, remembered today as the first produced screenplay by James Toback. Toback has been remade before. His classic, Fingers (1978) became an over-praised French film, The Beat My Heart Skipped (2005), that just didn't have a Toback feeling. The Gambler does. Michael Monahan's screenplay changes a lot - personalities, story details, relationships - but the essential thing, of an intelligent man playing Russian roulette at the gambling table, is the same. And Monahan locks into a Toback vibe, creating flashy characters, as smart as they are sleazy.Mark Wahlberg plays Jim, a literature professor at Columbia, not the first person you might imagine on the faculty of an Ivy League college, but then he's not the usual professor. In the movie's first minutes, he walks into a gambling joint and runs up $10,000 into $80,000 at the blackjack table. Then he starts losing and ends up more than $200,000 in the hole. Jim is in the grip of something he can't control, but what makes him an unexpected character is that he's intelligent enough to know why he's doing what he's doing. No one can tell him anything about himself that he hasn't already thought of.Watching from the outside, the audience can recognize that what Jim really wants is to gamble with his existence - one shot, up or down. But as the movie presents it, reaching the point where it's life or death can take a while. Mobsters won't kill a guy over a gambling debt, for example, until they're really sure they're never going to get their money back.Wahlberg is good in this and much different from James Caan, who in 1974 was warmer and more mercurial. Wahlberg's take on the role is to give Jim a lot of self-loathing and a lot of contempt for everyone else. Over the years, Wahlberg has acquired enough gravitas to make us believe that he's smarter than everybody - and that he knows it's doing him no good. Jessica Lange plays his hard, wealthy mother, and Monahan gives the actors just enough for them to create a wealth of subtext behind the mother-son interaction, none of it positive or loving.Actually, Mom is the essential difference between Wahlberg and Caan. Caan has the glow of mother love on him. Wahlberg plays Jim as having made the adjustment to a lack of love, but in a twisted way. He's gambling now to see if the universe loves him.'The Gambler'Rated R: for language throughout, and for some sexuality/nudityRunning time: 111 minutesxxxxMichael Kenneth Williams and John Goodman play underworld figures to whom Jim owes money, and when you owe someone money, you have to listen to them, which means they get more than their share of the movie's colorful dialogue.",1
"There are times when watching David Oyelowo in “Selma” that it’s really easy to believe you’re looking at Martin Luther King Jr. Aside from the accidents of age, size and appearance, Oyelowo has studied King’s gestures, not only his public manner — his dramatic use of his arms and hands — but his more private side, the weary yet determined quality he had in one-on-one interviews. In the movie’s more private moments, Oyelowo even sounds like King. What he can’t match — probably no one could — is King’s powerful oratorical voice. Still, this is a remarkable performance, remarkable not only in its force, but in its strength and precision. Oyelowo is reason alone to see “Selma,” and if you need another reason, there’s Carmen Ejogo, as a lovely, strong and haunted Coretta Scott King.No, “Selma” is not a great movie. But it’s a very good movie on a great subject, the events leading up to King’s 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery and to the passing of the Voting Rights Act. In the best sense, it’s a movie about politics, specifically about how things get done, and much of the drama involves the maneuvering between King and President Lyndon Johnson, who has his own agenda and timetable and won’t move unless pushed. And Johnson was not an easy man to push.To make “Selma” not just function but soar, this movie needed a Johnson as compelling as its King. But Tom Wilkinson as Johnson is all wrong, even aside from the fact that he’s 10 years too old and looks like Richard Nixon. Wilkinson flails in the role. Sometimes he has a Texas accent. Sometimes he doesn’t. Worst of all, Wilkinson’s Johnson isn’t frightening, and he needed to be, in order to make those scenes with King really pop. By all accounts, Johnson was a terrifying figure in person, huge and relentless, and with a look in his eyes that was just a little bit crazy. Imagine going into the office of that man, the most powerful in the world, and telling him what to do. King did that, and we should feel it. But we don’t quite, because Wilkinson plays Johnson as reasonable and fretting. You can blame the actor, but when some of the best scenes in a movie don’t land with the right force, the director must get some of the blame. Director Ava DuVernay handles the two-person scenes between King and Coretta Scott King impeccably, with a real feeling for the unstated communication between couples. But a climactic scene, such as Johnson’s “We shall overcome” speech before a joint session of Congress, is tossed away.Throughout there are little inexactitudes, some important, some merely nagging. Tim Roth plays George Wallace, but he’s older than Wallace and lacks that nasty bantam rooster quality Wallace had. At one point King calls the great gospel singer Mahalia Jackson and has her sing to him. Jackson had a magnificent contralto voice. The Jackson here is a mezzo. And why is Dylan Baker playing mean old J. Edgar Hoover (albeit in a single scene)? Until they said Hoover’s name, I thought somehow Robert McNamara was entering the story.Still, DuVernay gets most of the big things right, including the most important thing, all the activism scenes. The marches and street demonstrations are conveyed with a respect for historical accuracy and a you-are-there sense of the dangers faced. To see this is to remember that King’s success was by no means assured. Easily, people could have been beaten up and killed without anything being changed.History has a way of seeming inevitable, but only after it happens. The value of “Selma” is it shows how things could have gone another way. It’s a testament to Martin Luther King’s vision and to the courage it took to pursue that vision. But it does something else, too. It shows the awfulness of being in possession of that vision, the terrible responsibility of it.  Oyelowo captures two looks that King sometimes had. One look was of seeing into the absolute abyss of the human soul and history. And the other was of seeing something better in the distance that he wasn’t going to get to. To see “Selma” is to feel and appreciate anew the burden of greatness.",1
"There are two ways of watching “Batkid Begins,” and they are equally rewarding. You can watch it as a heartwarming document of the time when a hard-boiled city stopped everything to make a little guy’s wish come true. Or you can look at it as a cautionary tale about how, even with the best intentions, a good idea can get too big and defeat its initial purpose. Director Dana Nachman includes enough information to support either interpretation, and even to allow the viewer to shift points of view, back and forth, as the movie goes along. In either case, the film is a fascinating look at how a true event can become a media event — and how courting the media can have good and bad results so mixed up that it’s hard to know where the good influence stops and the corrupting influence starts. “Batkid Begins” details the events leading up to Nov. 15, 2013, when the Make-A-Wish Foundation granted a request by Miles Scott, a 5-year-old leukemia survivor from a small town in Northern California, to become Batkid. An itinerary was created, in which San Francisco became Gotham City. Volunteers started getting involved; the story took off over the Internet, and soon film composer Hans Zimmer was writing a “Batkid” theme. By the time the day arrived, police were braced for an influx of tens of thousands of people who’d come to witness the event — some having traveled by airplane over many miles. At one point, there were thousands standing in Union Square, cheering when Miles appeared, looking down from the window of a restaurant. The event culminated outside City Hall, with Miles, in his Batkid suit, getting the key to the city from Mayor Ed Lee.It sounds great ... it even was great. Yet, having seen the film, there is one thing that’s hard to get around: The little fellow didn’t seem to be having that good a time. He liked some of it, but by the middle of the day, he was ready to pack it in. He had dispatched the Riddler and gone to lunch — that was enough. It’s only when his father agreed to ride with him in the Batmobile that Miles decided to go on with the rest of the day.The people who did seem to be having fun were the adults, who enjoyed taking time out to play and savored the idea of doing something for a nice kid who’d been through a tough stretch. Many of them got very caught up in the great time they thought Miles ought to be having. Fortunately, Nick and Natalie Scott, Miles’ parents — despite pressures all around them and a media onslaught that had to have been intimidating — remained entirely focused on Miles and his reactions.Actually, at one point in the film, Miles does seem to be genuinely having fun, and that’s on the night before the big media event. His parents bring him to a gymnasium, where he meets Eric Johnston, who’d be playing Batman the next day. Johnston teaches Miles some gymnastic moves — how to bounce and tumble — and he also lets him swing on a flying trapeze. That’s a wish in itself and wonderful for a kid, in that it’s personal, interactive and human scale. But riding in a fancy car, getting cheered by crowds and getting a key to the city for just being you? Those are corrupt adult fantasies, with nothing to do with childhood.So there are two morals to the story of “Batkid,” and you can choose either one or both. The first is that human beings are capable of beautiful, selfless acts of kindness. The second is that, if you’re giving somebody a gift, give something that will actually please that person, even if it’s not what you’d want, even if it’s just not flashy.",1
"There are wars, plagues and famine, acts of random cruelty and injustices in the world so extreme and irrevocable as to confuse the mind and deaden the spirit. Yet for months last year, Conan O'Brien somehow became this country's most conspicuous victim, when his Tonight Show tenure was canceled after lousy ratings and something of a public shafting by Jay Leno and NBC.Conan O'Brien Can't Stop shows O'Brien in the aftermath of the debacle, as he organizes and then embarks on a comedy tour throughout the United States. The value of the documentary is that it doesn't buy into O'Brien's sense of himself as a latter-day Anne Frank (he actually compares himself to her at one point). Nor is it a hit piece. Rather it shows the peculiar compression and exaggeration of the performer's world.We see O'Brien, probably not at his worst, but as bad as he'll allow himself to be with a camera breathing down his neck, sniping at hapless subordinates, taunting them with the possibility of dismissal. He prepares jokes - but every one of them is either lame, bitter or both. He asks for feedback, then lashes out at the slightest hint of criticism. When a staffer suggests tossing out a witless musical number, he compares him to someone willing to trash the Mona Lisa.On the other hand, we see O'Brien giving and giving, constantly putting out for fans and anybody else who happens by. At one point the William Morris agency schedules O'Brien to host a party before he has to do a show, which means expending an exhausting amount of energy before he has to go and put out more. Seeing his life from the inside, the impulse to judge him fades. You would not want to trade places.-- Advisory: Strong language. Documentary. Starring Conan O'Brien. Directed by Rodman Flender.

"There have been many movies about cops working undercover, but “The Infiltrator” is different. It shows the difficulty of it, the almost-second-by-second stress involved in having to be yourself without being yourself, and having to seem relaxed without ever relaxing. It’s possible to get nervous just thinking about this movie. At the center of it is Bryan Cranston, an actor very good at conveying pressure. It’s not enough to say that he makes us understand what he’s feeling. He makes us feel what he’s feeling. There are many moments, too many to count, when an abyss threatens to open up at his feet, and he has to do some quick thinking, all the while maintaining a facade of composure. Another actor doing the same might seem like a cool customer, but Cranston gives us more than the surface. With just a dark flicker crossing his eyes, he somehow gives us his heart rate and his blood pressure. It’s a wonder how anyone could do undercover work, but to do it in 1985, the year in which the movie is set, must have been close to suicidal. Cranston, playing Robert Mazur, a real-life federal agent who infiltrated Pablo Escobar’s Colombian drug cartel, goes through the movie holding a tan suitcase. The suitcase’s false top drops down to reveal a big reel-to-reel tape recorder — very dangerous technology that looks like something out of “Get Smart.” The real Mazur was in his 30s when he took this case. Cranston is older, and so the movie rolls out a familiar and reliable device. Here Mazur has just passed retirement age, but he decides to go on one last job, this time posing as a coat-and-tie mobster with an offer to the drug cartels: He can launder their money, millions of it, without leaving a trace. Cranston’s maturity makes it a slightly different movie, and a more effective one. He doesn’t seem like a thrill-seeker but like someone too old to be enjoying anything about this. For him, the work is nothing but difficult, and he seems vulnerable.As the money launderer, he is introduced to a group of drug dealers by a  fellow cop (John Leguizamo), and from there he has to work his way to people of higher influence. Each person he meets is like a new study in moral perversity. These are individuals who have been skewed by their own evil actions — they’ve gone off the existential edge — and yet he has to fit in with them and gain their trust. Director Brad Furman does a nice job of suggesting this weird moral universe in subtle ways. The people Mazur deals with tend to smile at the sight of pain and look puzzled at the slightest hint of tender feeling.Yul Vazquez is particularly memorable as a dapper, gay mid-level operator. He speaks gently, but every word suggests a threat and even something worse than that, a kind of ghastly, enveloping darkness. Through Vazquez’s performance, we understand that Mazur’s mission is winner-take-all. Either he puts all these people in prison, or he and his entire family are going to be killed, and they’ll probably be tortured first.It’s a dangerous mission, and to make things even more stressful, the people who are working undercover with Mazur don’t seem nervous at all. His partner on the inside (Leguizamo) is naturally blithe, an adrenaline junkie who likes to improvise. And Kathy, the federal agent posing as Mazur’s fiancee, is on her first undercover assignment.As played by Diane Kruger, Kathy is an interesting character who makes an unexpected decision going in. Instead of sitting there and smiling, she decides to be an extrovert, which means seeming open and authentic, the furthest thing from a person who’s hiding something. It’s a great idea, but every time she opens her mouth, the entire audience braces for a mistake. In most movies, cops come to like being undercover. Sometimes they go native and like it too much. The genuine success of “The Infiltrator” comes from the fact that Cranston seems to hate it, that his every second is full of dread and terror, and he can’t wait for it to be over. And so he makes everyone in the audience a nervous wreck.",1
"There’s a feeling of contrivance about “Laggies,” with characters thrown together who wouldn’t be thrown together, and events stringing along that would never be allowed to happen. But Keira Knightley holds the whole contraption together with a performance of spontaneity and offhand inspiration.To think of the making of this movie is to envy director Lynn Shelton. It must be a wonderful thing to look through a camera or stare at a monitor and watch an actress save your whole movie. Knightley, scene by scene, makes something rich out of something plain, and something human out of something mechanical. What’s there to do but keep the focus on her and get out of her way?Seeing Knightley here, it’s hard to believe this is the same actress who was so embarrassing in “A Dangerous Method” and who made audiences root for the train in “Anna Karenina.” Is it possible — just tossing this out — that Knightley has been the victim of her English accent? It has caused her to be cast in stuffy period films, not to mention those awful “Pirates” movies, when she might ideally belong in the contemporary world. If this movie and last summer’s “Begin Again” are any indication, she might really be a comic actress.The term “laggies” refers to people lagging behind in early adulthood — people whose real lives haven’t really started yet. In the case of Megan (Knightley), who has an advanced degree but no career, and who has an affectionate yet oddly stale relationship with her live-in boyfriend, life hasn’t started because she doesn’t want it to start. That is, she knows, if only unconsciously, that if she makes the most obvious moves available to her, she will be permanently miserable.There’s an insightful scene early in the movie, in which the sweet-natured boyfriend (Mark Webber) attempts to propose to her at friend’s wedding. He’s trying to get down on one knee, and she’s pulling him up, but what makes the scene not only funny is the panic — the specificity of the panic — on Knightley’s face. The panic is not that the proposed marriage must not happen but that the proposal itself must be stopped at all costs.This is soon followed by another proposal scene, a private one, in which Knightley’s utter command of the character is first evident. In a way, it’s a scene you’ve seen a thousand times: A woman reacts to a proposal she doesn’t want. But Knightley lands her response in a multitude of conflicted emotions, which have nothing to do with the usual comic disdain for the boyfriend. When she says yes, we can see the reluctance, but its source is elusive, a whole tangle of thoughts and feelings ranging from the serious to the trivial.Much of “Laggies” involves an unexpected friendship that develops between twentysomething Megan and a teenage girl (Chloë Grace Moretz). The girl needs a mother figure, and Megan needs the comfort of being around someone years away from the big life decisions — in other words, someone who doesn’t see her standing still as a crime. Sam Rockwell plays the girl’s lawyer father, with a veneer of cynicism and a hint of something tender that he’s protecting.If you look back on “Laggies” after seeing it, you’ll have the pleasure of understanding just how Knightley put together her performance. You’ll see that all of Megan’s actions have proceeded from a fear of facing one specific reality. At the same time, within this frame, her performance is so loose that it just seems as if it’s being made up on the spot. And of course, the director gets some of the credit for that. So here’s the case of a movie that is, in every way, nothing special — except for the way it’s made and how it’s done.",1
"There’s a moment in “The Florida Project” in which a little girl, no more than 7  or 8, stands under an overhang staring at the rain. The shot goes on for maybe five seconds, but it’s just enough to remind us how disappointing — how borderline calamitous — a rainy day seemed at that age, when you had big plans to spend the day running around outside. “The Florida Project” is a very strong movie about what it’s like to be a little kid, the exuberance and freedom, the sense of excitement around every corner, and the vastness of single days. Childhood is the movie’s subject, in general terms. In specific terms, it’s about what it’s like to live in a motel in a rundown section of Orlando, close to the Magic Kingdom that is Disney, and to that other magical kingdom known as the American dream, and yet to be permanently and hopelessly outside of it.This motel living is an aspect of American life that most of us know nothing about. In “The Florida Project,” young Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) lives with her mother — a heavily tattooed young woman named Halley (Bria Vinaite) — but mostly spends her time as the ringleader of a group of other kids, who engage in spitting contests and adventures to other motels and abandoned buildings in the area. The kids always seem to be having a good time.The motel manager has less fun. Played by Willem Dafoe — the only famous face in the movie — the manager spends his days dealing with difficult and angry tenants, bedbugs, safety violations, the police, and with his own awareness that, for most of his residents, he is the bottom rung on the ladder. If he throws them out, or if they get themselves evicted through criminal activity, there’s nothing left but the street.Director Sean Baker (“Tangerine”) makes fine use of Dafoe’s gruff-saint quality, and the actor responds with a moving and complicated performance. The rest of the performances in “The Florida Project” don’t seem like performances at all, but like artfully captured reality. Downright remarkable is first-time actress Vinaite, who really isn’t a single mother living in a motel in Orlando. That would seem obvious but actually comes as a surprise to those who’ve seen the film. As Halley, she is that raw and convincing, playing the character, not only with no judgment, but with the kind of abandon and misplaced vanity that a non-actor might have when playing herself.Halley is the character we can’t stop thinking about, because we can’t come to a settled opinion (or perhaps judgment) of her. She is, in many ways, a person out of control and a disaster as a mother — except in the one way that would make her truly a disaster. She’s not unkind. Her son and daughter really like being around her. She’s fun and accepting, and though she lets them get away with a lot, she’s not without a sense of moral responsibility. Vinaite makes all of this clear, without seeming to be trying to do anything. Like a fly-on-the-wall documentary, “The Florida Project” has a loose structure: It has a well-planned beginning and end, but a muddled middle. This results in an experience that is smooth sailing for the first 45 minutes, but then hits a slog that goes on for another 40, before the movie revives again in its last half hour. Obviously, a film can’t be great if you spend 40 minutes wishing the thing would end already. At 95 minutes, “The Florida Project” could have been a masterpiece.As it stands, there’s a greatness in it, but also stretches of emptiness. Still, this is an original piece of work, and no one who sees it will forget it.",1
"There’s a mood, a feeling about life, that pervades “Nocturnal Animals,” one that’s expressed in visual terms. There is surface beauty, but the kind of beauty that suggests frigidity and alienation. A shot of a cityscape conveys no sense of interconnection, of people being a part of something, but rather of mechanical movement, observed by a mind standing on the outside, unable to engage.  This is the world as seen through the eyes of Susan (Amy Adams), a highly successful art dealer in Los Angeles, who rightly believes that the art she sells is junk. Writer-director Tom Ford presents Susan and her environment through a palette of deeply saturated color, bordering on over-exposure. Everything is beautiful, but it’s definitely not real. Based on the novel “Tony and Susan” by Austin Wright, “Nocturnal Animals” takes place in three separate times and places. At the center is Susan, who is having a midlife crisis, as well as the dawning realization that her relationship with her handsome younger husband (Armie Hammer) is dead and empty. One day, she receives a novel in the mail, written by her first husband, a man she brutally left years before. As she reads it, the story of the novel fills the screen. The novel is not what you might expect. It doesn’t depict a moody relationship drama. Rather it presents a tale of violent crime and revenge, in which a husband (Jake Gyllenhaal), his wife and teenage daughter are forced off the highway by a gang of crazy thugs. That Isla Fischer — who looks a lot like Amy Adams — plays the wife tells us that the woman in the novel and the real-life ex-wife are somehow related in the author’s mind. The novel makes up approximately 40 percent or perhaps as much as half of the screen action, and it’s nasty and gripping, working in all the ways that a thriller might. Its story doesn’t spool out all at once, but in bursts, as Susan reads it in her modernist and austere palatial home. Often the novel’s scenes are so tense that it comes as a relief to go sharply back into the quiet of Susan in her room. Ford seems to have an instinct for when things are becoming too much. The movie also dips into flashbacks of Susan’s courtship and relationship with the then-aspiring novelist, who is also played by Gyllenhaal. What we sense, from very early on, is that Susan has made a mistake in her life. The mistake might have been that first marriage, and it might have been that divorce, but something isn’t right. Adams plays Susan in her 20s and in her 40s and conveys a different turn of mind for each, a journey from baseless confidence to doubt. But even more impressive is the way Adams subtly shows how elements of Susan’s character remain consistent from one era to the other, a certain pessimism and a lack of courage.Gyllenhaal goes to extremes of emotion in not one but two roles, and by now we just take for granted that Gyllenhaal can go through emotional hell on screen without raising a flicker of doubt in the viewer’s mind. A few years ago, the emergence of Matthew McConaughey as a serious actor was a topic of conversation. What’s deserving of notice now is that Gyllenhaal, in recent films such as “Southpaw,” “Nightcrawler” and now “Nocturnal Animals,” has emerged as one of our best screen actors. “Nocturnal Animals” is not a great film, in that for all its virtues of atmosphere, mood and performance, it doesn’t support a wider vision. If there’s an ultimate point to the three stories, it’s a rather simple one. The film lacks a certain grandeur or complexity, but so do most movies, and the very fact that we end up looking for the grander elements as the film wears on, tells you how strong it is in every other way.  In the end, there are complexities within “Nocturnal Animals,” not in terms of overall conception, but in the nuances of character and in the details of sound and visuals. When you look back on the film, it won’t be on moments, but on a feeling of place, like being in the midst of holograph. Ford creates a world that is almost as repellent as it is seductive, but it is seductive all the same, and in that way, it haunts the mind. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic.

"There’s a tension at the heart of “The Imitation Game” that’s never completely reconciled. On one side, we have the story of Alan Turing’s work during World War II, of his breaking the Nazi’s Enigma code, an achievement that none other than Winston Churchill said was key to winning the war. On the other side, there is the filmmakers’ understandable desire to frame the movie as a personal story about Turing himself.The code-breaking story has tremendous urgency. Britain is losing the war, and the one man with the prospect of breaking the code, Turing, is so strange and off-putting that he alienates everyone in power. In his first starring role in a major film, Cumberbatch brilliantly enacts a variation on his familiar role, the cold, tormented genius, a close cousin of his modern-day Sherlock Holmes and his Dr. Frankenstein, which he played at London’s National Theatre.Turing’s personal story is also worthy of attention, but considerably less urgent. He was probably obsessive-compulsive and may have had Asperger’s syndrome. He was also homosexual at a time when that was still a crime in Britain, and his 1952 arrest for “gross indecency” was the calamity that ruined his life. These elements must be a part of any film about Turing, but simply as drama, they’re less compelling than the salvation of civilization. They’re also at cross-purposes in terms of genre — a historical thriller versus a tragedy.Of course, none of this would matter were the story told chronologically. But Graham Moore, in his first produced screenplay, mixes it all up. So we go from scenes of Alan as an odd schoolboy, getting hazed by his classmates; to scenes of him in the 1950s, being questioned by police; to scenes during the war, trying to break Enigma. Flashing back and forward is always a challenge, because audiences usually prefer to stay where they are. But it’s especially difficult when one section is simply better than the other two. The result is that “The Imitation Game” never quite builds up a head of steam. Invariably, just as things are getting really interesting, we’re jolted back into the past or forward into Turing’s future. It’s a tribute to the inherent fascination of the subject, the sterling performances by the actors and the direction of Morten Tyldum that “The Imitation Game” always maintains its hold on the viewer. But the raw material was here for a great film, and they came back with only a good one.Still, good is good. Cumberbatch has a way of enlisting an audience’s complicity, even as he seems positively freakish to everyone else onscreen. Moreover, he gets us on his side with no special pleading, without ever indulging in a private moment to let us know he’s really a sweet, sensitive soul. When Alan presents himself to the government, as the war is starting, as the country’s greatest mathematician, we believe him — we would even if we didn’t know the history. Cumberbatch has a lot of truth about him. We know he can’t be wrong and that he wouldn’t lie.The Enigma story, which remained a secret for decades, is extraordinary. The Nazis used an encryption machine that had 159 trillion possible settings and would change their encryption codes every night at midnight. To go through all those variations would take a human being 20 million years. It was Turing’s insight that what was needed was a machine that could rip through those combinations at lightning speed. So while his colleagues were working with a pen and paper, Turing set out to invent a computer. “The Imitation Game” translates Turing and his team’s achievement for a lay audience, while dramatizing the personal, scientific and bureaucratic obstacles they faced. Keira Knightley supplies the film’s warmth as Joan Clarke, the only woman on the Enigma team, who became Turing’s friend. The story of Turing’s persecution was also worth telling, and it’s too bad the screenplay arranged it so that it had to compete with the Enigma story. In a season of movies that are almost uniformly too long — by as much as an hour, in some cases — “The Imitation Game” is the one film that might have been better off longer. Starting the story in 1938 and just going through Turing’s life chronologically might have taken an extra 20 or 30 minutes, but it would have been worth it. ",1
"There’s nothing like a cappella, especially when accompanied by musical instruments. That’s the case in “Pitch Perfect 2,” and although  that makes the a cappella not exactly authentic, the movie compensates with a fullness of sound as well as spirit, plus an off-kilter sense of humor that keeps the laughs coming. As of today, this is the most delightful movie out there.A sequel to the 2012 original, about a college group of a cappella singers that wins a national championship, the new film shows the group’s ambitions widen to include the whole world, but with some very funny setbacks along the way. The movie’s only weakness, a small one but it has to be mentioned, is a slight sag about two-thirds in, when the women go away to camp. For about seven or eight minutes, this otherwise energetic movie stands still, but sitting through a tiny dead spot is a small price to pay.“Pitch Perfect 2” gets off to a flashy start, with the ladies performing in Washington, D.C., before an audience of bigwigs that includes the president and first lady. As the first couple watches from the balcony, the singer known as Fat Amy (played by the shrewd Australian comedian Rebel Wilson) has an epic wardrobe malfunction. This is captured on live television, and the group finds itself disgraced, with only one path to redemption left — winning the international championship in Copenhagen.This sequel was directed by Elizabeth Banks, who in recent years has shaded her screen personality into something distinct — zany but contained, eccentric but not oblivious, someone funny, unconventional and aware. “Pitch Perfect 2” is a little like that, like what Banks has been bringing to the screen lately, only this time she is coming at you from all sides, through all the characters. Banks herself appears as the snippy, diva-ish co-host of an a cappella podcast, which gives her a chance to comment on the action.In “Pitch Perfect 2,” the women are seniors, experiencing anxiety about leaving the college nest, as well as nostalgia in advance for all they’re leaving behind. Actually, that’s the one scene in the camp sequence worth salvaging, the one in which the women sit in a circle and start missing each other, even though they’re all still there. The nostalgia of middle age has got nothing on the nostalgia of youth, which is very intense and forms half the basis of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s stories.Already, these women are starting to go in different directions. Beca (Anna Kendrick), the leader of the group, is moonlighting as an intern at a recording studio. The group has admitted an up-and-comer into their ranks, a freshman named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld). Come to think of it, the audition scene in which Emily is admitted is a bit odd. She doesn’t do much, and yet they welcome her. Maybe their ears are more trained than the audience’s. Or maybe that was the best Steinfeld could do. Along the way, almost incidentally and not in any painful sense, “Pitch Perfect 2” is a musical. (It’s a little like “Glee,” but without the sappy earnestness, a difference that makes all the difference.) There’s a terrific scene in a private nightclub, in which several a cappella groups — including the Green Bay Packers! — compete against each other. And the production numbers are great to watch, including those of the competition, a scary German group that does hip-hop inflected a cappella with cold, Teutonic precision.Better still, the ending of “Pitch Perfect 2” arrives five minutes before it’s expected, about one minute before it’s desired.",1
"There’s something to be said for staying perfectly still and saying nothing, and allowing the other person to discover his or her true feelings. In essence, that’s what happens in “The Big Sick,” a romantic comedy about a relationship that finally goes into overdrive when one of the lovers falls into a coma.Written by Kumail Nanjiani (“Silicon Valley”) and his wife, Emily V. Gordon, the movie is pretty much their real-life story, and the fact that it’s based on truth probably accounts for much of what’s original and unexpected about it. No one here has a fancy job, and everyone dresses like a slob. The settings are tiny apartments, with roommates right outside the bedroom door, and a dive comedy club where Kumail (Nanjiani) works as a regular. Later, when Emily gets suddenly and alarmingly ill, a lot of time is spent in the hospital.Of course, knowing that Kumail and Emily are married gives away two plot points: (1) Emily doesn’t die; and (2) The lovers end up together. But it’s a romantic comedy, so you’d know that anyway. The key thing is that “The Big Sick,” with ease and seeming effortlessness, makes us care a lot of about these people, together and separately. And their journey is odd enough to be interesting.Kumail meets Emily (Zoe Kazan) in the comedy club. She’s in the audience and whoops it up during one of his jokes, which leads to a conversation at the bar and then to sex just a few hours later. Afterward, since they really don’t know each other, they try to be cool and tell each other how much they’re not really interested in a relationship. And from there they start spending several days a week with each other. Soon, they’re close enough that she tells her parents all about him, but he says nothing about her to his parents, because they’re religious Muslims from Pakistan. His parents assume that they will arrange Kumail’s marriage for him. To that end, they keep inviting single Muslim women to drop by the house every time Kumail comes for a visit. For the audience, this becomes a source for more than humor: It’s a window into a culture.There’s one scene in “The Big Sick,” and only one, that rings entirely false: Emily realizes that Kumail, because of his family background, will never marry her, and he agrees. He lets her walk out of his life. But nothing in the movie leads us to believe that Kumail’s ties to his family are quite that strong. In fact, as it turns out, Nanjiani says this is the film’s only major plot turn that’s entirely fictional. In real life, Kumail and Emily did not break up before Emily’s sickness.Still, though the breakup scene may be awkward and hard to believe, that one little plot turn serves up the rest of the movie. Kumail not only has to worry that Emily is sick, but also that he got her sick. He ends up spending time with her parents (Holly Hunter and Ray Romano), who fly in to be at her bedside, but because of the breakup, there’s tension in the air. Hunter and Romano couldn’t be better. They enter the film not as caricatures or even characters but as complete people, carrying the backstory of a 30-year marriage with them. They’re both up to the demands of comedy, but it’s Romano’s dramatic ability that comes as a surprise. He lets us feel the weight of having a daughter hovering between life and death. The veneer is dignified, but the inner life is panicked.Nanjiani is engaging throughout, though the scenes of his standup routine are a little confusing. He’s not funny, not even slightly. Is he supposed to be? That’s not clear. As for Kazan, she spends most of the movie unconscious, but she makes a strong impression in her awake incarnation. To be specific, the audience is already in love with her long before Kumail gets there. ",1
"There’s such a thing as sheer luck, and “Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House” benefits from it. It’s the story of a career FBI officer, the second in line behind J. Edgar Hoover, whose covert leaks to the Washington Post — as “Deep Throat” — led to the end of Richard Nixon’s presidency. Written and directed by Peter Landesman, this film has been in development for more than a decade. It was cast in 2015 and began filming in the spring of 2016. Were it released a year or two or 10 ago, it would have been regarded as a competent, reasonably engrossing but intermittently dull glimpse of a historical event as experienced from a revealing new angle. To be sure, “Mark Felt” is precisely that. But watched today, in light of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump administration, it has an extra intensity, as a possible preview of coming attractions.The movie fairly highlights the crucial importance of this one man’s action. There’s a tendency, for example, to compare the situation today with that which existed in the early 1970s and to conclude, for example, that Trump is much safer than Nixon ever was, because Nixon had to deal with a Democratic Congress. What we don’t fully appreciate is that Nixon’s ironclad control of the executive branch, with cronies installed within the FBI and at the head of the Department of Justice, almost killed the Watergate investigation in the crib.The story begins in 1972, with Felt (Liam Neeson) as a 59-year-old G-man, having spent half his life at the FBI. With the death of director Hoover in April, Felt expects to be elevated to the top spot, but Nixon wants his own guy in there, L. Patrick Gray (Marton Csokas). When the Watergate scandal breaks, Felt has to watch as evidence is suppressed and investigations are curtailed. He sees his own director and the attorney general mischaracterize findings and make false statements. And he is outraged. As played by Neeson, Felt is a forbidding figure, stern and austere almost to the point of creepy, not a campus radical but the opposite type of Nixon enemy — a rigid straight shooter. Felt just doesn’t like crime, and so, in the pursuit of justice, he does something that would seem almost impossible for someone with a long career in secrecy. He starts leaking to the press. He’s so desperate to get the story out that he’s willing to feed his information to a 29-year-old novice, one who, as luck would have it, just happens to be Bob Woodward at the start of a great career in journalism. With “All the President’s Men” forever emblazoned in our collective consciousness, it’s fun, or at least illuminating, to see some of these same scenes from Deep Throat’s point of view. Given his position, Felt was privy to highly classified information. Every time he fed something to Woodward, his bosses (including Nixon himself) knew that only a handful of people had access to that information. Felt’s task was to feed Woodward just enough to keep the investigation alive, while never revealing his own hand. Interestingly, the movie suggests that Felt may have been hoping, through his leaks, to prevent Nixon’s re-election. Instead, Nixon won in a 49-state landslide.All the Watergate material in “Mark Felt” is gripping, and one wishes it were the movie’s entire focus. Instead, Landesman spends time on Felt’s relationship with his tempestuous wife (Diane Lane) and with his sadness over a missing daughter who ran off to join a hippie commune. Landesman and the actors do their best, but they can’t make Felt’s private life as interesting as his covert life. No one could.Still, there’s enough about Watergate here to make slogging through the personal stuff worth it. In the end, “Mark Felt” is reassuring, because it suggests that the American system is so brilliantly constructed that, no matter how strenuous and persuasive is the lying, and how powerful the liars, one person in possession of the truth can bring down a corrupt administration.

Thriller. Starring Jude Law, Rooney Mara, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Channing Tatum. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (R. 105 minutes.)Probably nobody besides Steven Soderbergh really believes he's retiring from making feature films, but if it's true, Side Effects isn't a bad way to go out. It's a gripping, maddening and thoroughly satisfying thriller, made with artfulness and integrity. Soderbergh sees things in his actors and gets things from them that other directors don't.  Written by Scott Z. Burns (Contagion), the movie starts as an expose of the pharmaceutical industry, about the culture surrounding mood-altering drugs and the monetary incentive that psychiatrists have to prescribe them. But slowly, the film takes other forms, acquiring velocity as it sets out in other directions. Ultimately, Side Effects is no serious exploration of prescription drugs in modern life, but rather a seriously entertaining movie that uses prescription drugs as a backdrop. But that's more than good enough. In a way it's the first important showcase for Rooney Mara, in that she was fairly unrecognizable in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and her role there was based on a prototype. Here, looking dainty and fragile, she plays a young woman who has been through a four-year trial: Married to her dream man (Channing Tatum) and whisked into a life of luxury, she saw her world cave in when he was arrested for insider trading. Now that he is back after a prison sentence, Emily (Mara) finds herself suffering from a suicidal depression. So she goes to a psychiatrist, who prescribes drugs to stabilize her moods. If Jude Law, who plays the psychiatrist, loses any more hair in front, he runs the risk of being recognized as a great actor. Soderbergh seems to have caught on to that already. As he did in Contagion, he brings out Law's inner goofball, as well as his neediness, his latent gentleness and his easily aroused capacity for panic. Or to put it another way, Soderbergh was the first director to figure out that Law is not cool, that he not only can lose his composure, but that nobody bugs out better. He gets plenty of opportunity to bug out - and explain himself to people who won't listen - and talk loud and be ignored - all of which is hell on the psychiatrist but is acting nirvana for Law, who is exactly in his element. But let's forget plot details, which are best discovered in the moment, and talk about Soderbergh's approach to the thriller genre. In Side Effects, Soderbergh is always doing two things at once, pumping the story forward, while creating the illusion of languor. Scenes are underscored with dreamy music, suggestive of people lost in a fog. The shots are longer than average. The camera movement is measured. At times, the style is a visual analogue to being in a depressed state. At other times, the seeming slowness creates a hint of entrapment, as if from the point of view of characters locked into circumstances, unable to free themselves no matter how hard they flail.  Yet this sense of crawl and sprawl is deceptive, because not only is there always something going on, but everything is happening quickly. Side Effects is a movie constructed of jolts and reverses, of scenes that end a line or two early, with information skipped and implied. Corners are cut, shortcuts are found, and other scenes are invested in, to the benefit of the actors and the audience.  It's not just Law who thrives, but after this, it's difficult to imagine Mara not having a long and productive career. And who would have thought of Catherine Zeta-Jones for the supporting role of a cold, austere therapist? Soderbergh is today's answer to Howard Hawks, totally different in style and yet with Hawks' feel for actors, story rhythms and genres, and with that Hawksian understanding that boring an audience is just not an option. Is this really Soderbergh's last film? It's probably important to him that he believe it, so he can recharge his batteries, but few people who are this good at something ever really quit, if only because they never find something else they're equally good at. Thomas Hardy stopped writing novels and wrote poetry for the last third of his life. That's a notable exception. Let's hope Soderbergh isn't another.",1

The cover was drawn by InHyuk Lee. As people gear up for the Black Panther movie, acclaimed author Ta-Nehisi Coates wants them to check out the original source, Marvel's Black Panther comic book, where he's booting up a massive outer space adventure for the king of Wakanda.This image provided by Marvel Comics shows the variant cover of Black Panther #1 written by Ta-Nehisi Coates on sale in May 2018 featuring his new storyline The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. The cover was“Black Panther” is grand-scale. It’s serious. And it represents a jumble of modern ideas and hopes that make it very much of this moment.There have been black superhero movies before — “Hancock,” “Meteor Man” and “Blade,” to name a few — but something feels different this time around. This one is coming from a deep place, and this time the whole world is interested.We usually see this kind of movie in May, a superhero blockbuster from Marvel Studios, except it’s better than most of those. These days action movies almost always begin with a bang. This one eases in slowly. For the first 20 minutes, one might even call “Black Panther” slow, but that wouldn’t be the right word. It’s measured. It takes its time and sets up a big story.In “Black Panther,” we are told of a small African nation that has the entire world fooled. Everyone thinks Wakanda is a Third World country, agrarian and self-sufficient, but impoverished. In fact, it secretly holds inexhaustible supplies of a metal called Vibranium, which is not only the ideal lining for a superhero costume, it can also be used to build high-speed rail systems and cure spinal injuries. Wakanda is the most advanced civilization and culture in the world, but it has an understandable distrust of other countries. If another nation were to gain control of the Vibranium, it could use it to enslave the world.FOX 32's Bill Zwecker sits down with Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman.These anxieties make Black Panther into a different kind of superhero. He is not like Spider-Man or Batman, always looking for trouble. Black Panther — in real life, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), Wakanda’s crown prince — wants as little conflict as possible. Even when he gets into conflict, it’s to avoid conflict, to keep a tight lid on things, so his country can continue to live as the envy of the world ... without having to suffer the consequences of the world’s envy.When T’Challa becomes king, he inherits his father’s isolationist, anti-immigrant policy. And immediately, there’s a new crisis: A British career criminal, Klaue (Andy Serkis), has teamed up with an Oakland-born man, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), to use the small amount of Vibranium they’ve been able to salvage in order to power their way into Wakanda and take the country over.Klaue is a chaos agent, a cackling sadist and, as played by Serkis, wonderfully and exuberantly repulsive, someone without a conscience. But Erik is a more complicated figure, driven by rage. He lost his father while still a young boy, grew up on the streets and has intellectualized his anger into an anarchist philosophy, a determination to supply the world’s dissidents with invincible weaponry.Erik’s position is extreme, but his point of view provides an interesting point of tension for viewers. Wakanda is a beautiful country, with violet electric-looking sunsets, lakes and mountains, and a skyline that makes Shanghai’s look antiquated. The rest of the world is dying of diseases and injuries that the Wakandans already know how to cure. Are they obligated to share this knowledge, which they’ve gained through their own industry, stable governance and unusual civic sanity?The script, co-written by director Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole, does something that is almost unique. It expresses the filmmakers’ sentiments through the villain. Or at least it makes the villain into someone not entirely wrong. At the same time, everything that the movie shows us about Wakanda (as opposed to telling us through dialogue) pulls the audience in the other direction, making us wish these people might be able to hold onto what they have in pristine privacy. These are tensions not only within the movie, but within the audience, and they’re traditionally American. Immigrants came to America, after all, just so they wouldn’t be bothered.If Coogler were less of a filmmaker, he would have softened Erik at the expense of the movie’s rooting interest and drama. Instead he lets the movie’s ideas take care of themselves and stays focused on T’Challa’s decency and heroism and on Erik as a moral monster — or, as T’Challa puts it, a “monster of our making.”But who is “our” here? Is T’Challa talking about Wakanda exclusively, or is he speaking for the filmmakers and referencing the United States?In any case, Boseman commands every moment of this film, radiating probity and purpose, and it’s only later on that you realize that, with another actor, this wouldn’t have been a sure thing. The Black Panther is a superhero with lots of uncertainty. He has to grow into his stature, and we see it happen.Lupita Nyong’o brings force and energy to the role of Nakia, T’Challa’s warrior girlfriend, and the British actor Martin Freeman successfully goes American, playing a CIA agent.And, oh yes, the action: How nice to see an action movie that has lots of other things to talk about. The action is fine. The action is good. There are a number of exciting sequences, particularly a chase scene about a half-hour into the film. But there’s probably less action in this superhero movie than any other of recent vintage, or at least it seems that way. For sure, there are no stand-alone set pieces. The action is integrated into the movie’s flow, and it’s just better that way.",1
"This is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood. Parker's choice of angles and shots are consistently right psychologically. His choices are informed by a real understanding of Melville's story, and the result is that, even though the movie is set in modern times, its heart comes through. Bartleby is not so much about Bartleby as it is about the journey of Bartleby's boss, played by David Paymer. He runs a small office that verifies public records for the city, and when we first meet him, he's a man running on autopilot, doing his job, going home, going to bed, feeling nothing. But coming into contact with Bartleby, who, after a promising beginning, suddenly refuses to work -- I prefer not to, he says -- ultimately forces him to locate his own pain and sense of loss. Paymer, as always, gives a sensitive performance, but so does Glover, operating within the constraints of an emotionally locked-down role and with little to say but I prefer not to over and over. We might never penetrate Bartleby's mystery, but watching Glover we believe he has one. The movie, which was shot in Marin County, benefits from good actors in the supporting roles: Glenne Headly as the secretary, the office sex bomb; Maury Chaykin as a perpetually flummoxed nervous wreck; and Seymour Cassel as the office's contact with city government. In the end, the movie leaves a viewer with a wistful sense of two things -- the loftiness of human aspiration and the mundane quality of daily life. In Bartleby, the disconnect between the two is the source of much quiet suffering. - This film contains adult humor and sexual innuendo. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Mariam Parris, David Ackert, Shaun Toub, Shohreh Aghdashloo and Maziyar Jobrani. Directed and written by Ramin Serry. (No MPAA rating. 87 minutes. At the Opera Plaza and Towne in San Jose.) . Forget the sometimes stilted acting. Forget the occasional scenes that are borderline cliched. Instead, focus on the message and the raw emotion that resonate throughout Maryam, one of the few American feature films to accurately chronicle the experiences of immigrants from the Middle East. It's 1979, and Iranian Americans are treated with suspicion and hatred because -- 7,000 miles away -- militants inspired by the Ayatollah Khomeini have stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and taken more than 50 people hostage. Maryam focuses on an Iranian American teen named Maryam (Mariam Parris) and her parents, who are secular Muslims living in a New Jersey suburb surrounded by trimmed lawns and rich, successful neighbors. When the family's more religious cousin Ali (David Ackert) comes from Iran to live with them, and the hostage crisis prompts hatred of Persian Americans, Maryam's once-pristine life is shattered. Ali, meanwhile, finds himself caught up in his own hatred: of Maryam's father, whom he blames for causing a death back in Iran; and of Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, Iran's former ruler who is being treated for cancer in a New York hospital. Revenge (Ali's and Americans') is a central theme in Maryam, but so too are Maryam's yearnings to fit in, pursue her love for a blond-haired classmate and better understand her family's history. Much of what happens to Maryam and her family could apply to a post-Sept. 11 United States, where immediately after the attacks on New York and Washington many Muslim Americans (who were trying to go about their daily lives) suffered hostility in a country that theoretically stands for tolerance and religious freedom. Maryam, the directorial debut of Ramin Serry, was made before Sept. 11. It's a low-budget film with high ideals, and it is enthralling and evocative, despite some flaws. Maryam introduces us to a family that wants to live the American dream but discovers there's no escape from world events that reverberate in unforeseen ways. Parris is an actress to watch, and Serry is a young director with a filmmaking voice that is original and timely. - This film contains scenes of some violence. -- Jonathan Curiel ",1
"This is probably sad, but somehow it doesn’t feel sad: The most consistently satisfying thing in the American cinema right now is the Liam Neeson action movie. With “Taken,” released in January 2009, the right formula met the right actor, and ever since, it has been a delight watching Neeson play downtrodden, fundamentally decent men who realize themselves by becoming homicidal maniacs.Now we have “Run All Night,” directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who has previously directed two of the better Neeson thrillers, “Unknown” (2012) and “Non-Stop” (2014). Collet-Serra understands the essential truth of these Neeson films, that they are thinly disguised rags-to-riches tales, in which a worthy person starts off low and ends up high.The lower he starts off, the better. In “Taken,” Neeson began as a former CIA agent, emasculated by domesticity. In “Non-Stop,” he was an alcoholic air marshal, boozing it up before a trans-Atlantic flight. In “Run All Night,” he’s really a mess: a drunken, conscience-ridden former hit man, reduced to begging for handouts from his friend and former boss (Ed Harris).How bad does it get? In an early scene, he has to tank up on booze in order to play Santa Claus at the boss’ Christmas party. The kids complain that he smells bad, and he makes lewd remarks to the wives. Clearly, this is a man without hope. He may have a particular set of skills, but they’re not in demand ... until they are.Jimmy (Neeson) also has a grown son, Michael, who hates him (of course), but that doesn’t stop Jimmy from saving his life. On the big night, Jimmy kills the man who is about to kill Michael. Unfortunately, the dead man is the son of the mob boss, which means that Jimmy and Michael have to ... run all night.The sheer perversity of Neeson’s thrillers is a big part of their delight. “Taken,” for example, was all about a father who gains the love of his teenage daughter by shooting, choking, stabbing and electrocuting scores of people. (Then in “Taken 2,” he bonded with the daughter by teaching her to throw hand grenades.) In “Run All Night,” Neeson is redeemed as a family man by going on a shooting spree. This is sick, but it’s a variety of sick that is strangely appealing. The closest precedent for Neeson’s thrillers is the “Death Wish” series of the 1970s, with Charles Bronson as a mild-mannered man who becomes a vigilante. But Bronson’s rampages were random and done out of hate, while Neeson is always motivated by love. This makes his films more twisted, while paradoxically making Neeson more lovable and cuddly.In fact, in “Run All Night” Neeson is so loving, he doesn’t just love his son. He also loves the mob boss who’s trying to kill his son. Watching the film, you can see that Collet-Serra worked with his actors, Neeson and Ed Harris, to make that relationship feel lived in and full of unspoken affection and a shared past. Every time they get together, they tell stories about the old days, and for once the stories sound like real stories about things that might actually have been enjoyable. Sometimes two old buddies have nothing in common but the past, but if they’re each other’s link to some lost, cherished part of themselves, that can be enough.After devising a sturdy frame for Neeson’s special brand of sorrowful mayhem, the filmmakers expertly fill in “Run All Night” with a series of charged action scenes, including a rare one in which Neeson chases after a cop car, instead of the other way around. The stakes are high, and the odds aren’t good. He’s such a decent person, and he’s clearly the underdog. He’s just doing what anybody would do under the circumstances. Yes, even when you’re smirking, Neeson makes you care.",1
"This is something that may come as a surprise to most people. It certainly surprised me: For years after World War II, most people in Germany didn’t know about the Nazi death camps. The vast majority, including intelligent and otherwise informed people, had never heard of Auschwitz and didn’t know what happened there. This state of ignorance persisted, not just for a year or two, but up until the early 1960s.“Labyrinth of Lies” is a German film about how the truth became public. It tells the story from the point of view of a young prosecutor who gets an inkling that something bad happened at the camps and starts investigating individual crimes. He discovers what  everyone now knows, that Nazi barbarism and cruelty wasn’t isolated, but systematized, and that there were thousands upon thousands of murderers and ghoulish sadists walking around Germany, free to go about their lives.The young prosecutor, Radmann (Alexander  Fehling), is a fictional character (this is disappointing to discover), an apparent conflation of the two young prosecutors who headed the investigation. But the general direction of Radmann’s journey seems to be historically based, and the character of the boss, the lead prosecutor, was real and is played by the late, great Gert Voss in his last screen performance. Radmann at first thinks that he has a methodical but straightforward task: He must gather evidence and then start arresting and charging Nazis. But he soon finds that no one in the West German hierarchy (except his boss) is interested in uncovering such shameful, horrifying unpleasantness. They’d prefer to let the Nuremberg Trials stand as the first and last statement on German culpability. He also discovers that many of the old Nazis have connections in the government. They’re protected.The film presents what is, in many ways, a generational tug-of-war. The young prosecutor has no connection with the past, while his older colleagues — even the ones just 10 years older — want to sweep the war under the rug. The movie dramatizes the struggles involved in the investigation and then devises some personal crises for Radmann, who must deal with appalling and life-changing knowledge. It’s only understandable that he might start looking around him and seeing every man over 40 as a murderer.“Labyrinth of Lies” is a fascinating lesson in the events leading up to the Frankfurt trials. Fehling is excellent as a rigid do-gooder who thinks he understands everything and then comes up against crimes that shake his sense of the universe. His fresh fierceness is nicely balanced by Voss, who says little but radiates wisdom. A little too much screen time is wasted on the efforts of the commission to find and prosecute Dr. Josef Mengele. If you know anything about Mengele, you know that he was never caught, and so it’s a little frustrating to see the protagonists trying to do something that we know can’t happen. But that’s the difference between European cinema and American. They sometimes make movies about losing efforts.",1
"This is turning into a very good year for Gugu Mbatha-Raw. The intimations of stardom that were evident in “Belle” come into full blossom in “Beyond the Lights.” As a work of art, the movie is merely on the bright side of OK. But as a vehicle for an emerging star, as a platform to show one actress in a variety of modes and moods, within a sympathetic and glamorous context, it couldn’t be better.Another way of saying this is that Mbatha-Raw is the whole picture. Those who invest in her and her journey might end up loving “Beyond the Lights,” even against their will. Those who resist her and watch the movie at a remove will inevitably be put off by the hamfisted manipulations of character and story — including that worst of all faults of the movie romance, the fake argument that occurs 20 minutes before the finish.Mbatha-Raw plays a newly minted pop star from Britain, with Rihanna-like hair extenders and a sexed-up persona. Driven by a fierce stage mother (Minnie Driver), she is on the brink of becoming a huge stateside sensation — when she gets drunk one night and tries to jump off the hotel balcony. She is saved by a handsome young police officer, and ... well, if you know Point A, you sort of know Point Z. The pleasure is in witnessing all the stages in between.Over the course of the film, Mbatha-Raw does many things, all of them quite well. There’s a moment, early in the film, when a fan says, “I love you,” and she looks disturbed, as though wondering how that could even be possible. In her dealings with people, she has a curious double thing going on, a misery laced with pride. She knows she’s not happy, but she knows she has something others want, or think they want. She exudes power without joy.As a singer, Mbatha-Raw must deliver the goods as a pop star, which she does. Then, adopting another style, she sings Nina Simone’s “Blackbird” with an emotional commitment that’s riveting. And all the while, we are tracing her character’s up-and-down journey toward finding her own truth, as an artist and as a person.Nate Parker has the role of Kaz, the heroic police officer, and he stays afloat, despite a plot that pushes him into behaviors and attitudes that aren’t consistent and don’t quite make sense. As the stage mother, riding the gravy train to the right side of the tracks, Minnie Driver has an aggression bordering on cruelty — at least until she and director Gina Prince-Blythewood pull back and look for the human being underneath. Sometimes surfaces are more interesting.There are many little things to complain about, if anyone wants to complain. The events that send the pop star’s career up and down wouldn’t really wreak such strong effects. There’s a stage of fame in which any publicity is either good or doesn’t much matter. But these flaws and exaggerations, though impossible not to notice, are easy enough to ignore, when you have Mbatha-Raw onscreen, giving it everything she’s got.",1
"This romance between Edward Burns and New York is obviously real. He sets his movies in Queens and Long Island and sometimes Manhattan, and he populates his movies with the same kinds of people -- working-class folks from Long Island or the boroughs. Even his worst movies have a sense of place, and his better movies have strong characters. Good stories often elude him. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald, he seems to start with a feeling, and from there, he sees what happens. Sometimes something happens, sometimes nothing. The Groomsmen is not outside the pattern. Once again, we're in the same world -- this time it's middle-class Long Island -- and it's about the same sorts of guys, nonprofessionals who do OK, who have small businesses or decent jobs. Burns is drawn to ensembles, to a succession of scenes that combine different sets of characters. He likes to let them talk, and so they talk. Really, in every way, this is like any other Edward Burns film, except for one thing. It's unmistakably better. This is the movie I believe Burns has been trying to make since The Brothers McMullen, 11 years ago. He does a few very smart things up front. First he compresses the time element. It's about the lead up to a wedding, and so there's the feeling of a story even if there isn't much of one -- everything's heading toward that wedding. Second, he comes up with characters who are all in interesting places in their lives. And third, he complicates their relationships: One has an old grievance. Another hates the other's girlfriend, etc. And so, from the first minutes, he makes the audience look forward to the confrontations. Burns, as usual, casts himself as the voice of reason and moderation. This time he's Paulie, an easygoing journalist who is days away from marrying his pregnant girlfriend, played by Brittany Murphy. It looks like a love match, but the pregnancy is forcing the issue, and the prospect of fatherhood is filling him with anxiety. His fiancee is also turning into Bridezilla in preparation for the wedding, and she resents the time he's spending with his friends -- even though this is the first time these guys have had a chance to all hang out together for eight years. The juicier acting roles go to the other cast members. As Paulie's older brother Jimbo, Donal Logue presents a portrait of complete middle-life implosion. He's fat, looks unhealthy, hates his job, hates his brother's fiancee and is reflexively nasty to his wife and everyone around him. He also lacks -- and this is an observant detail on Burns' part -- the intelligence and emotional introspection to rescue himself. Really, this is a portrait of a man almost beyond redemption, a middle-aged married guy who sits in strip joints in the afternoon. It's a portrait of hopelessness, though Burns' vision is so upbeat by nature that he can't let that stand. John Leguizamo plays the prodigal who returns after eight years. He has lived in Manhattan, estranged from his family and cut off from his friends, but now he's back with interesting things to say for himself. His former best friend, played by Jay Mohr, meanwhile, has never left his father's house and keeps showing up at the door of an ex-girlfriend who wants nothing to do with him. His life is stalled. The most settled and happy of the group is Dez, played by Matthew Lillard, who is usually cast as a bug-eyed idiot, but here gets to play a sensitive father and a loyal friend. He does it well. In fact, the casting is strong throughout. The wives are the kinds of wives these fellows would have, and even the minor roles are cast with an eye for truth. Not everyone cares about this sort of thing, but for those few who are interested in what average folks are like in Long Island and in the boroughs outside Manhattan, The Groomsmen is the movie to see. World Trade Center gets the working-class accents right, and yet the sounds ring false because the actors don't get the attitudes and rhythms behind the accents -- the defensiveness, diffidence, combativeness and provinciality. Burns does, and he makes sure his actors do. That's Burns' world, urban provincial. He never forgets the truth about New York, that it's really just a lot of small towns. -- Advisory: Strong language, nudity, sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle 'How to Eat Fried Worms' Comedy. Directed by Bob Dolman. With Luke Benward, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Thomas Cavanagh and Kimberly Williams. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Decades before Fear Factor enriched all of our lives, kids had to feed their gross-out urges by reading Thomas Rockwell's How to Eat Fried Worms over and over. The film version by family-friendly Walden Media captures the less palatable parts of the book with squirmy detail, but the plot points between the worm parts don't add up to much. It's a pleasant and well-intentioned end of summer diversion that doesn't possess the imagination-stoking qualities of a premier children's movie. Rockwell's novel has a few elements that are dated now -- no 10-year-old would be allowed near the motorbike that the worm-eating Billy desires in the book. But the movie features even more changes, to play up the bullying elements and give more for Billy's parents (Thomas Cavanagh and Kimberly Williams) to do. In the Worms movie, Billy (Luke Benward) has just moved to a new town, which seems to be filled with the most evil schoolkids this side of Children of the Corn. After a confrontation where the meanest kids put worms in his Thermos, Billy gets caught up in a bet to eat 10 worms in a day. Each worm gets cooked a different way, ramping up the stomach-churning fun. But the other scenes are slow and often random, including a meaningless subplot where Billy's parents play doubles tennis. Like a lot of books turned into movies, Worms never gets into a really good groove. The kids are fine in the film -- especially Austin Rogers and Alexander Gould (so good in Showtime's Weeds) as two members of the pack -- but the exchanges between the children are too scripted, which is probably the director's fault. The child actors also seem to talk more like kids from the 1970s, and ride bikes from that era (without helmets!), even though the movie takes place in the present. Although young readers may gripe about the changes from the book, parents should be relieved that the PG content seems tailored for classroom discussions about meeting new people, sticking up for your friends and especially bullying. How to Eat Fried Worms goes the extra mile with the last topic, even showing a little sympathy for the meanest boy, who is picked on relentlessly by his older brother. There's also a pleasant side story about a girl who towers above the boys and is made an outcast, played by Hallie Kate Eisenberg -- that little girl from the Pepsi commercials. Our streets are safer when child actors from the 1990s are getting work, instead of crashing their Saturns into mailboxes. -- Advisory: Worm consumption scenes may be disturbing to people who haven't been exposed to the bug-eating immunity challenges on Survivor. -- Peter Hartlaub 'Lunacy' Drama. Directed by Jan Svankmajer. In Czech with English subtitles. With Pavel Liska and Jan Triska. (Not rated. 118 minutes. At the Opera Plaza and the Shattuck.) It would be lunacy to suggest that a Czech film of that title is going to have a huge following or even that it should. But fans of movies about inmates who take over an asylum -- King of Hearts and Marat/Sade are prime examples -- will be amused by this surrealistic take on the subject punctuated by animated interludes featuring, of all things, dancing meat. The stop-motion animation is so realistic it may make your stomach turn. A carcass is vivisected and its innards come waltzing out. Later, they perform in a puppet show. Director Jan Svankmajer is somewhat of a legend, a pioneer animator in his native Czech Republic whose bizarre use of claymation influenced Tim Burton. Svankmajer moved into live action a couple of decades ago, and Lunacy is his attempt to combine both forms. It's based on two Edgar Allan Poe short stories and inspired by the work of the Marquis de Sade, so you know you're in for a kinky fright. The whole film has a Twilight Zone feel. It opens with a nightmare, a recurrent one for a 19th century Frenchman named Jean (Pavel Liska) in which two corpulent attendants with demented grins come to take him away in a straitjacket. His frightened screams awaken everyone in his boarding house. It's a safe guess that this dream is a harbinger of Jean's fate. How he winds up institutionalized involves a chance meeting with a marquis (Jan Triska) who looks like Steve Buscemi. Like the big bad wolf, he beckons Jean to join him. Adding to the sense you've arrived in the Twilight Zone, the marquis travels in a horse and buggy alongside a freeway with cars racing by and gory accidents piled up on the side of the road. At the marquis' castle, Jean witnesses an orgy as preposterous as anything in Eyes Wide Shut. After all this, the scenes in the asylum -- where the marquis brings Jean ostensibly to help him get over his fear of winding up in one -- are a bit anticlimactic. Jean is led to believe that the doctors are actually patients who have locked up the attending staff so they can have the run of the place. Those locked up in the furthest recesses of the institution have been tarred and feathered first. This leads to an animated sequence of a piece of meat being tarred and feathered. While dinner and a movie is in theory a great idea, I'd avoid eating before taking in Lunacy. -- Advisory: Bizarre sexual situations and violent images. -- Ruthe Stein 'Gabrielle' Drama. Directed by Patrice Chereau. With Isabelle Huppert and Pascal Greggory. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Isabelle Huppert is at it again, torturing men, in Gabrielle, a meticulously directed film by Patrice Chereau. Based on The Return, a short story by Joseph Conrad, it's a chamber piece about the implosion of a marriage, with echoes of Ingmar Bergman. It's very much like Bergman in that it's mainly composed of a series of honest and uncompromising conversations between a husband and wife over the issue of infidelity. It investigates various shadings of emotions, showing us both what the characters understand about themselves and what they can't possibly see. However, it's different than Bergman in that ... well, in that Chereau is French. In Bergman, everything is an epic moral transgression, an affront to a God who might be watching -- or an expression of despair because the characters believe he's not watching. But Chereau, like most French directors, is not interested in morals or judgment. He's interested in the mechanisms of human emotion and behavior. Set at the turn of the last century, the film begins with a scene that looks straight out of a Lumiere film, with the husband (Pascal Greggory) walking home from a train station, reflecting on his settled and secure life. That doesn't last long. He comes home to a note from his wife, saying she has left him. And just as he's dropping bottles and accidentally breaking glasses, doubling over and cutting himself and wandering in a daze, the wife (Huppert) walks back in. She couldn't go through with leaving him. The film's impact has a lot to do with Fabio Vacchi's original score, which is both plaintive and coldly modernist, with echoes of Charles Ives. It's the sound of a new century, as the film, in a sense, depicts people caught between the propriety and the restraint of the 19th century and the introspection and Freudian quest for fulfillment characteristic of the 20th. Though every eye is on Huppert, and although Gabrielle's emotional and moral natures seem to be at the center of the film, the journey depicted is really that of the husband. Gabrielle is about a man who thinks he's a 19th century man but finds out that he's in fact a man of the 20th. Or to be less vague, it's about a man who, shaken out of materialism and complacency, comes to realize his need for love over security and social acceptance. Greggory is up to that journey, revealing the character in his various colors, and Huppert is at her usual best, subtle, emotionally full, focused and honest. The film contains one classic Huppert moment: She sits silently, as her husband lectures her, and when he finally comes to his conclusion -- I forgive you -- she bursts into hysterical laughter. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
"Those of us old enough to remember Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court of the United States remember him as a stern, heavy presence. So what a surprise to meet him again in “Marshall” and to find out that, as a young man, he was a very cool guy — fearless and charismatic, and not just brilliant but up for a good time.“Marshall” is a historical drama that will introduce many Americans to the life and career of one of the 20th century’s most important lawyers. But if the filmmakers feel any responsibility to that fact, they wear it lightly — and well. “Marshall” is a serious movie, but it’s not preachy or didactic. Rather, it tells its 20th century story by reviving a surefire 20th century form, the courtroom drama. The year is 1941, and Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) is a lawyer for the NAACP. In fact, he’s the lawyer for the NAACP, so he travels constantly, providing legal counsel to black Americans wrongly accused of serious crimes. Unlike other criminal defense lawyers, it’s his policy to defend only innocent people. It’s hard, uphill work, and in addition to the rigors of the court, he has to deal with racists and threats of physical violence.The story of “Marshall” centers on a court case in Connecticut. A rich white woman (Kate Hudson) claims that her black chauffeur raped her twice and tried to kill her by throwing her off a bridge. Meanwhile, the chauffeur (Sterling K. Brown) insists that he had no contact with her, that the claims are entirely false. In the woman’s favor is not only that she’s white and rich, but the obvious question: Why would she lie? And working against the man is not only his race, but also that he has a dishonorable discharge from the military and a history of stealing from his previous employer. So Marshall and his partner on this project, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), have all that to deal with, plus a hostile judge (James Cromwell) and an enraged community that just assumes the chauffeur is guilty.“Marshall” revisits such serious history that it feels almost disrespectful to talk about it as a fun movie, but it is. The court case has many sides to it and is like a puzzle for the audience, as well as the characters, to work out. There are no dull scenes. And as played by Boseman and Gad, Marshall and Friedman are a complementary pair, like something you’d see in a buddy movie — one fit and one fat, one black and one white, one tall and one short, one calm and one stressed, but both Americans working together in a just cause. Like its title character, “Marshall” remains breezy and engaging, while never losing focus on its higher purpose. The movie reminds us that, though much of American life is ruled, as it should be, by majority opinion, juries must reach their decisions, not through gut feeling or uninformed impulse, but by the application of the laws and the evidence. In this way, the courts have been central, not only to the preservation of American freedom, but also to its expansion.“Marshall” is yet another case of a movie that was made in 2015 and early 2016 but that feels tailored to the specific concerns of our particular moment. That’s the uncanny way good movies have of knowing what’s coming before it happens, and of knowing what to say and what people need to hear. ",1
"Though clocking in at only 92 minutes, “A Ghost Story” is a bit of an endurance test. It’s slow, with long unbroken shots, as if it’s trying to depict an eternal state by seeming as though the movie itself might never end. But it’s also an original piece of work, beautifully conceived and shot, full of feelings and ideas about the essential issues in life. For those willing to take the journey, writer-director David Lowery offers an experience that will be hard to forget.“A Ghost Story” doesn’t look like other films. It’s shot in a 4:3 ratio, the frame used in very old movies. In addition, the four corners of the frame are rounded off, so that the screen looks like an old photograph from the 1970s. The color palette consists mostly of whites, yellows and browns, and cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo often uses some kind of soft focus, creating an almost sepia effect or a faded quality, as if everything is either a memory or slipping into the swamp of time. Individual shots are lovely to behold, and because the movie lingers on them, we have time not only to appreciate them but also to register that what we’re seeing is photography, not real life. The effect of this isn’t distancing in the emotional sense. It has rather a heightening effect, as if these characters — a young husband and wife, played by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck — have been selected for some special destiny.That destiny turns out to be a cruel one, as the husband, after a brief introduction, is killed in a car crash. After being identified by the widow and covered in a sheet, he wakes up in the morgue and starts walking around, looking like Casper the Friendly Ghost, a white sheet with dark oval eye holes. A bright light opens in front of him, but he doesn’t walk into it. He chooses to go home.The last hour of the movie is almost entirely free of dialogue. The ghost watches, his posture resonating quiet misery and helplessness, as time spools out. A neighbor leaves a pie for the wife. The wife comes home and eats the pie. First she eats it standing up. Then she eats it sitting down, and the eating goes on for minutes. The eating is in itself interesting, eating reduced to a physical process, and at some point we realize that Mara is crying as she’s eating. “A Ghost Story” is not without touches of humor and irony, and yet it’s a deeply sad film, an exploration of loss from the ghost’s standpoint. The impression we get, without it ever being spelled out, is one of utter despair and disorientation, with perhaps just a hint of hope to make the ghost’s hopelessness more painful. Gradually, a sense even emerges as to the nature of the universe, with Lowery perhaps making the suggestion that an attachment to the world is a painful form of spiritual error.In any case, the film is impressive. It’s not for everybody, and even those who appreciate it may, at times, become impatient with it. Yet there is something to be said for a director using cinema to such serious purpose, and for the act of faith that that required. David Lowery has made a movie that is as outside the pattern of our current popular filmmaking as can be possibly imagined. That takes more than vision alone. It takes courage. ",1
"Thriller. Starring Eric Bana, Rebecca Hall and Ciaran Hinds. Directed by John Crowley. (R. 105 minutes.) The cloud of dystopian despair that we've come to take for granted in our movies has drifted all the way to Britain, as can be seen in the thriller Closed Circuit. It depicts a world of evil terrorists warring against almost-as-evil British government officials, in which friends aren't trustworthy, old verities are defunct and nobody is safe except the stupid. Nice to know our British cousins aren't feeling too optimistic these days, either. Eric Bana plays an English barrister who is appointed to defend a terrorist, for a crime that is something like a combination of 9/11 and Oklahoma City: al Qaeda, a car bomb, lots of casualties. Martin (Bana) gets the job because the previous barrister committed suicide. (Or ... did he? Hmm.) It's a high-profile case that will be good for his career, so long as he does a very poor job of defending his client. Closed Circuit is steeped in the details of English law, and rather than being obscure or arcane, these details ground the film and give it an authentic air. Apparently, in such cases, there is the main defense barrister, but then there is another barrister charged with conducting the investigation. And the peculiar thing is that the two barristers can't be in contact with each other while the investigation is taking place. This becomes a matter of some importance over the course of the movie.  In essence, the two lawyers must collaborate in the dark, which might be tricky under normal circumstances, but in Closed Circuit is downright alarming, as both start getting separate pieces of a complicated and frightening puzzle. No surprise, there are also personal complications: Martin and Claudia (Rebecca Hall), the investigator, used to be lovers, etc. Actually, the personal details, in the hands of these actors, seem more than perfunctory, and Martin's characterization as a ladies' man with a messy home life makes for a colorful touch of weakness. Neither protagonist is a heroic type. He is crusty, impatient, slightly superior, and she is a humorless stickler. But they find themselves thrown into a situation in which they have to be either much better than they are or much worse. It's an uncomfortable choice. We'll avoid going into plot specifics here. But to speak generally, Closed Circuit is about two lawyers whose lives become endangered as they get closer and closer to a secret that powerful entities would like to keep under wraps. What's peculiar about the movie - both a flaw and a virtue - is that neither is trying to do anything of tangible importance. That is, they're not trying to prevent some terrible event from taking place. They're really only trying to hold up concepts, but important ones, like honesty and the rule of law. And they're trying to survive. So on one side you have people fighting for something nebulous and right, and on the other side you have elements within the government fighting something tangible (terrorism) but doing it in ways that are immoral, illegal and murderous. This makes the barristers' struggle less than completely riveting, in that they might be working to uphold something that no longer exists. For all their worldliness and cynicism, they may be children in a world of adults, fighting a lost cause. This makes for less drama, but in the end might be the point. In addition to Bana and Hall, Jim Broadbent is outstanding in a couple of scenes, as a government official, watching from the sidelines and offering warnings and advice. Broadbent is somehow menacing, pathetic and persuasive all at the same time.",1
"Thriller. Starring Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin. Directed by Brad Anderson. R. 96 minutes. There are thrillers and then there are thrillers. And then there's The Call, which, if it were any more intense would require a complete physical and medical clearance for admission into the theater. I saw this film with a packed audience of about 300 people having 300 nervous breakdowns, people jumping out of their skin or compressing into the seat in an agony of tension. At one point in the movie, a woman tries to crawl through a narrow space, and I found myself moving forward in my seat as though, by moving, I could help her out of there. That's how complete is this movie's ability to put you in the predicament of its characters. The Call might not be a classic for the ages, but for a Friday night? For a movie to take people out of themselves? And to make them marvel at the viewing experience that just happened to them? This one is hard to beat. It's so simple. It's an idea that has been lying on a table forever, and someone finally picked it up. Halle Berry plays Jordan, a 911 dispatcher, in a phone center the Los Angeles police call the Hive. It is a high-stress job, because every single bad thing that happens in Los Angeles is first heard about in this room - and lots and lots of bad things happen in Los Angeles.  One night Jordan takes a call from a teenage girl reporting a lunatic trying to break into her home. Jordan gives the girl good advice, at first; then she makes a crucial mistake. This mistake haunts her for six months, so that when she finds herself talking to another girl in another crisis, she is determined to do everything she can to make sure the girl survives. Aside from a brief introduction, The Call takes place entirely over the course of just a few hours. Abigail Breslin plays a teenager who wakes up in the trunk of a car speeding down the freeway, with a serial killer behind the wheel. She happens to have a cell phone and calls 911 - i.e., Halle Berry - but it's one of those disposable cell phones that can't be traced. It seems hopeless. It's an enormous city, and all the girl knows is that she is in a red car. The dispatcher has to figure out a way to help her escape, but without much time and next to no options. The script finds ways to spin this out into a succession of riveting incidents that are believable enough and brutally nerve-racking. Berry and Breslin are everything the script demands of them - controlled, abandoned, frantic, hysterical, enraged. They and director Brad Anderson bring us into their world. But let's spare some love for Michael Eklund, too. He plays the serial killer, and he's so convincingly vile, pathetic and repellent that audiences may forget he's acting. Indeed, it's a risk to be so good at playing someone so awful. Let's hope Eklund isn't rewarded for his efforts by having to play serial killers for the next 10 years. In any case, by the time The Call is over, viewers are muttering to themselves, strangers are talking to each other, and people are planning where they're going to have a drink to calm down. It's one of those movies, that rare thing - a thriller that actually thrills.",1
"Thriller. Starring Rachel Weisz, Monica Bellucci and Vanessa Redgrave. Directed by Larysa Kondraki. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The difficult thing about true stories is that they're not neat and tidy. In the opening minutes of The Whistleblower, we meet a dedicated police officer (Rachel Weisz) whose huge problem is that she lives far from her daughter and can't seem to get a transfer. But then, the movie pivots, and in a way too obvious to land with any emotional force, this Nebraska cop sublimates her maternal longings into an investigation of sex trafficking rings in Bosnia - what in more quaint and less correct times was known as white slavery. This all feels pulled in two directions, forced into a pattern and just not quite right, and so The Whistleblower - the true story of Kathryn Bolkovac, who in 1999 joined a private security company doing peacekeeping in Bosnia - is clumsy and ineffective in its first half hour. But gradually, as her investigation deepens, and we see the true hideousness of what she is uncovering, the movie achieves urgency and clarity of purpose. The feature film debut of director Larysa Kondraki, it's designed to make you think and to make you outraged, and it will do both. Seemingly within days of arriving in Bosnia, Bolkovac discovers women who have been raped and abused. But none of her colleagues or superiors is interested in prosecuting or even investigating these crimes. Methodically, just by doing her work as a cop, she starts pulling on the line and soon finds that the fish she is pursuing is getting bigger and bigger . . . and scarier and scarier. It might devour her.  In The Whistleblower, the crimes are just the logical extension of the institutional sexism rampant in the private security company, which Bolkovac thinks is going to be a consortium of elite police officers but which turns out to be more like the foreign legion - the scum of the earth with guns and diplomatic immunity. Kondraki gives the film a grainy, oversaturated look that accentuates a sense of something overripe and ugly.  Vanessa Redgrave mostly listens as Bolkovac's bureaucratic advocate, but no one listens better. And Weisz gives a psychologically astute performance as a woman who can't leave things alone; it's not in her nature. If it were merely a drama, The Whistleblower would be so-so. But the good thing about true stories is that knowing they're true makes them better.",1
"To say that “Sicario” is about the drug war along the Mexican border makes it sound like a dozen other movies: A young FBI agent with a score to settle joins up on a secret mission to undermine a drug kingpin. But in the handling of that story, in the places it goes and the ways in which it’s filmed, “Sicario” is impressive from beginning to end.It has a screenplay of freshness and audacity that’s brought to life by a director who understands its every psychological undercurrent. We might hope this kind of thing would happen all the time, but it’s rare. Denis Villeneuve knows what to emphasize, and he knows how to create a mood simply through camera placement and movement. No scene in “Sicario” is merely functional. Nothing is tossed off. Within minutes, maybe seconds, the world of this film envelops you, and there’s no escaping it.The first hint that “Sicario” is something exceptional comes in the first sequence, in which the FBI agent, Kate (Emily Blunt), leads her team on a drug bust in Arizona. The sights and the perspectives are unexpected: They don’t come through the door. They make their entrance by bulldozing through a wall. And then the scene resolves in the discovery of horrors best left undescribed here.Director Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan are in harmony on the film’s essential point, that the horrors depicted in “Sicario” are also horrors of the spirit. This is not good guys and bad guys warring over their conflicting interests. This about the outer reaches of human depravity and iniquity, and how just witnessing the fruits of it can erode the soul. And the brilliance of “Sicario” is that it presents unspeakable things in a workaday way, with no elevation to make sense of it all. Following the Arizona bust, the young agent volunteers for a secret mission, alongside a CIA operative (Josh Brolin) and a Mexican mystery man (Benicio Del Toro). But she is treated like a junior partner and isn’t told anything. If you see the film, notice how the placement of the camera emphasizes Kate’s perspective. She sits in the back of a room at a briefing, and Villeneuve never brings the camera in for a close-up of the man conducting it. Villeneuve stays in the back with Kate, who can barely follow along.Later, she is on a private plane with Del Toro, but Villeneuve never really gives us an establishing shot of the plane’s interior so that we feel at home in it. Instead, he cuts from close-ups of Del Toro to close-ups of Blunt, so that we feel Kate’s isolation and the close confinement of the small jet. From there, there’s a sequence in Juarez, which mostly consists of the three main characters driving around with a fourth operative, played by Jeffrey Donovan. Notice that Donovan  never gets a close-up, and we barely see his face, because he’s sitting in the front seat of the car, and Kate is sitting in back. And notice also how that makes Donovan’s  character more strange and compelling. The whole Juarez sequence — a simple thing; they have to move a prisoner across the border to a U.S. facility — is brilliant, a study in compressed tension.If at any point in “Sicario,” you feel lost, don’t worry about it. The movie is all about being lost and, in any case, all becomes clear, eventually. The filmmakers take the conventional genre of a drug thriller to make an unconventional point — or a feeling more than a point. The intention seems less to say something about the drug war than it is to show what people are capable of, and to capture an emotional and psychological condition. If you get the feeling, you’ve understood the movie.As for the actors, they are everything they need to be, but this one was the director’s show all the way. They must have felt in very good hands.

"To see “Chappie” is to feel as if you’re looking inside a mind infested by everything wrong with today’s movies. Writer-director Neill Blomkamp (“District 9”) is in love with action. He’s in love with CGI characters, computers in general, and the dystopian future that is always two or three or five years away and always horrible. Yet “Chappie” is invested with such humanity, such a seemingly effortless delicacy of feeling, that it makes one suspect that, even if movies continue in this machine direction, they’ll never fully give way to machines. When you get to the level of art, there’s a human strain that’s irreducible, that has to be there, or else there’s nothing.And Blomkamp is definitely an artist. It’s hard to say how much he’s doing consciously and how much he’s doing through intuition, but he’s doing really interesting things in “Chappie,” and right from the beginning. For example, he starts the movie with the soundtrack as a heavy presence, as he introduces various plot elements. It’s as if everything you’re seeing is part of some overarching symphony of meaning. But then, once he’s grounded us in his world, he eases up on the music, and the characters become specific, no longer emblematic. Soon we’re embroiled in the struggles of three sets of characters. There’s Dev Patel as Deon, a scientist working in the field of artificial intelligence. Specifically, he is working for a company that is providing the city of Johannesburg with a robotic police force, but in his off hours, he has come up with a way to give robots consciousness.Then there’s Ninja and Yolandi, played by the South African rappers Ninja and Yo-landi Visser, respectively. The two want to pull off a big heist, but the mechanical cops are an insurmountable obstacle. So they get the idea of kidnapping Deon, the chief engineer, figuring he can devise a way to switch the robots off. And finally, there’s Hugh Jackman as a rival robot maker, consumed with jealousy and frustration at what Deon has achieved.The character of Chappie enters the picture when the kidnapped Deon brings him to life at Ninja and Yolandi’s hideout. Unlike the usual robot, he comes into the world with the mind of a child, knowing nothing, but with an infinite capacity to learn quickly. The movie becomes, at one level, a struggle for Chappie’s soul between the good parent, Deon, and the bad parent, Ninja, with Yo-landi as the surprisingly affectionate mother figure, somewhere in the middle. This is probably as good a place as any to say that Yo-landi, in her feature debut, is a real find, with a childlike voice and appearance, but with a whole atmosphere of corruption about her. Imagine Giulietta Masina from the Fellini films, only alarming and futuristic. Most of “Chappie” involves Ninja’s efforts to push the naive and pliable Chappie into crime, and Deon’s to move him toward good. One of the film’s marvels is how well Chappie is developed as an endearing character. He’s a digital creation, but Sharlto Copley, in a motion-capture suit, created his movements and also gave him a voice. There’s something alive here — about childhood, about coming into the world innocent, about parenting, about unconditional love ... “Chappie” has an unconscious life to it. Unlike most modern sci-fi films, which deal entirely in external movements, there’s an internal quality about this. There’s a tangle of feelings, impulses and ideas at work here that can’t completely be untied or explained but that identifies the story as something coming from a real place within the filmmaker, a place beyond intention. Indeed, the fact that you can’t quite say exactly what “Chappie” means, but you know and feel that it means something, tells you that it’s operating on a level beyond consciousness. It’s what makes it a work of art. So it’s fitting that, even on a plot level, Blomkamp is too smart to settle for pat answers. For example, if Chappie is virtuous, then he shouldn’t be a criminal, but Blomkamp doesn’t go the other way and say he should be a robot policeman. He’s operating from a broader and more humane point of view.And it’s a good sci-fi action movie, too. Far be it from me to give this movie the kiss of death by making it seem too serious for its core audience. “Chappie” is everything it has to be — but it’s everything it should be, too.",1
"To talk about the story of “Wind River” doesn’t tell you much about why it’s a superior movie. The story deals with a murder on an Indian reservation and an FBI investigation by an agent from out of town, and if you’ve made it this far into the sentence, I congratulate you, because I might have stopped either at the Indian reservation or the part about the FBI. “Wind River” sounds like the usual thing, but it’s not.Yes, the story here performs its function. It’s interesting and at times even exciting and suspenseful, but its emotional effect has much to do with the characters and our investment in them. Taylor Sheridan, who wrote screenplays for “Sicario” and “Hell and High Water,” wrote and directed this with an unmistakable commitment to the place and the people he was depicting. He takes us somewhere. We learn the customs, and the world, and the weary philosophy that everyone seems to share, and come away almost feeling as if we’ve been there, or that these people and places have somehow become part of our interior landscape.The movie is set in Wyoming, on an Indian reservation during the winter, at a time when everything isn’t just covered in snow, but practically buried in it. Everyone is slowed down. Going outside requires preparation and proper clothing. Walking is difficult. Driving is dangerous and complicated. So what looks peaceful from a distance actually is perilous, and everything awful in human nature that you might expect to be suppressed by the temperature and the landscape is just bottled up and looking for ways to explode.A young woman’s body is found in the snow, miles from shelter. Her feet are bare and frostbitten, and she has died from something most of us have never heard of, a process by which the lungs crystallize and hemorrhage from the cold. An autopsy reveals that she was raped, so she was running from something. Jeremy Renner plays the hunter and tracker who finds her body, and it turns out that he knew her. She was a friend of his daughter, who died two years earlier and in pretty much the same way.If this sounds like a crazy coincidence, a contrivance of the plot, it actually speaks to something far worse. Native American women have the highest rates of rape and assault in the country. So it’s not far-fetched that two girls who knew each other might suffer the same horrible fate.Graham Greene plays the local police chief, but he has only a handful of officers tasked with policing an area the size of Rhode Island. So the FBI is brought in, but, inevitably, it’s just one agent, young and practically in training wheels, who knows nothing about Indian reservations or even cold weather. But as played by Elizabeth Olsen, she’s tough and wants to do a good job.Most of the movie deals with the tracker and the agent and their collaboration to find the person responsible. The plot gives the story propulsion, and there is never a sense of things slowing down, and yet Sheridan finds time to expand into the characters’ lives. Renner’s performance isn’t so much about presenting a certain kind of professional or illustrating a certain kind of person within a certain kind of environment as it is about presenting a portrait in grief. Better still, it’s a portrait in living with grief and having it transform, in the words of Aeschylus, into “wisdom, through the awful grace of God.”Renner is moving in this, and Olsen has a nice contained ferocity, which is a good and unsentimental choice for the character. But in some of the supporting and featured roles, there are stray moments that are hit too hard, that take “Wind River” into the realm of melodrama and almost past it, into absurdity. This is probably just a consequence of Taylor’s directing his own material and having no buffer between his impulses and what appears on screen.All the same, “Wind River” is an impressive effort and an impressive result that opens up a world that most of us have never thought about and renders it with sorrow and vividness.

"To those who weren’t around at the time, it’s hard to convey the excitement of the first “Jurassic Park” in 1993. The characters onscreen were seeing dinosaurs for the first time, but it really felt as though the audience was seeing them, too. It was as though all the picture books that you’d ever seen when you were 8 years old had come to life.By the series’ second installment, we were used to dinosaurs, and by the third, they were old hat. But the true intelligence of “Jurassic World” is that it acknowledges that and doesn’t do the obvious, stupid thing in response. It doesn’t double down on the violence. It doesn’t follow the usual summer movie pattern of wall-to-wall action, split-second cutting, and trembling, shaking camera work. Instead, “Jurassic World” matches the wit and pace of a 1990s monster movie with the attitudes and anxieties of 2015, and the result is a film that’s as smart as it is exciting. These days, we are every bit as concerned as we were 20 years ago about dinosaurs stepping on us, but we have other worries, too, and “Jurassic World” finds a way to incorporate them and satirize them. We have a corporate culture run amok — embodied here by Bryce Dallas Howard, as a crisp-looking theme-park executive who uses the word “assets” when she means dinosaurs and “asset containment unit” when she means security. We have scientists splicing genes and copyrighting the results, embodied by BD Wong as a researcher so intellectually perverted that he can’t stop smirking when he talks about his creations.Disruptive ideasAnd when Dwight Eisenhower warned of the military-industrial complex, perhaps he was thinking of Vincent D’Onofrio, who has the bright idea to weaponize the velociraptors for fighting in the Middle East. D’Onofrio is a pleasure to watch here, a confident bully, and yet with a lightness of spirit that comes from breathing the rarefied air of lunacy.It’s 20 years later, and human beings, with their infinite capacity for adaptation and amnesia, especially when there’s money to be made, have chosen to overlook those unfortunate dinosaur incidents from back in the day. Jurassic World is now a theme park, and a lot of thought has gone into it. There is the Gentle Giant petting zoo, and opportunities for patrons to roll through a field of plant-eating apatosauruses, while protected inside a Plexiglas hamster ball. But the big-ticket items remain the scarier attractions.Unfortunately, attendance is down. Nobody cares about the T. rex these days. They want “bigger, more teeth,” and so — this is really twisted, but exactly what would happen — the scientific team comes up with a “new asset through gene splicing,” the Indominus rex, who is enormous and highly intelligent, and can change color and elude heat sensors. Moreover, it has such a lousy personality that it kills for fun.But as the movie starts, it’s just a normal day at the park. Claire (Howard) is showing representatives from Verizon around, seeking corporate sponsorship for the Indominus rex, while her two visiting nephews are being attended by an assistant. Like a Steven Spielberg movie — though this is directed by Colin Trevorrow — the opening is leisurely, laying down a foundation of relationships that will become important later. For example, Claire once had a brief affair with Owen (Chris Pratt), an animal trainer who seems to be the only one in the park who understands that these dinosaurs are alive and have feelings. “You made them in a test tube,” he says. “But they don’t know that.”Reveling in actionThe action scenes are imaginative and suspenseful and gradually take on a demented exuberance, with huge-headed dinosaurs sniffing at people and velociraptors attacking in packs. The music of Michael Giacchino repurposes the best of John Williams’ original score, and although the film ultimately lacks that extra something that Spielberg often brings — the sense that the action is somehow emblematic of something grand in the human spirit — the movie has a caustic wit that will do in its place. With the exception of Pratt’s animal trainer, virtually everyone in “Jurassic World” is crazy, but they have so much company they don’t know it. “Monster is a relative term,” the scientist (Wong) says, as though he can taste the words. “To a canary, a cat is a monster. We’re just used to being the cat.”Indeed, what ultimately makes “Jurassic World” so satisfying is that it doesn’t buy into the grandeur of the human spirit, not one bit. Instead it shows you a beautifully realized theme park, with holograms and concession stands and rides and attractions, and presents it ... not even as a monument to arrogance. Even that would be giving it too much credit. It’s just a monument to colossal dumbness. “Jurassic World” is an intelligent action movie that’s saying something simple but true: Yes, people are that stupid.",1
"To watch J.K. Simmons in “Whiplash” is always to be wondering what it is you’re seeing and what is going on in this man’s mind. Simmons plays a familiar character, a relentless and demanding music teacher, but what he and director Damien Chazelle offer us is anything but typical. This teacher remains mysterious, even as to motive, just an awful but charismatic fact in his students’ lives.For Simmons, this is a great moment. For years he has been a standout actor in supporting roles, sometimes the best thing in a movie, and yet his name has been barely known to the public. Show his picture to people, and they will say, “Oh, that guy.” But he has deserved better than that, and now he’s got it. He plays Fletcher, a music teacher at a top conservatory who is known for strong results and terrifying teaching methods. His favorite story, practically his governing principle, is that a drummer once threw a cymbal at the young Charlie Parker for doing a mediocre solo. Parker responded by studying for a year, only to come back a supreme musician. To Mr. Fletcher, the point of the story is that abuse helps talent come into bloom.And so Fletcher keeps dishing out abuse from the bottomless stewpot of his own neurosis. We first meet him as a figure in a doorway, listening to Andrew (Miles Teller), a young drummer, practicing. The head games begin immediately. First he embarrasses him for stopping abruptly. Then he embarrasses him for playing. And then he walks out of the room. So now the kid is convinced that the most important music teacher in the school thinks he has no promise.“Whiplash” is not a movie about a young person who comes to understand the teacher’s point of view. Neither is it “The Paper Chase,” in which young and old come to an uneasy peace. It’s also not something like “The Piano Teacher,” in which the teacher is merely insane and wants to destroy her students. “Whiplash” is a little of all those things, but mostly it’s a mystery — one that tantalizes us and torments the lead character.As Fletcher, Simmons does two performances, one for his students and one for us. Sometimes they overlap, as when he stands in front of the jazz orchestra and flogs his students with every kind of insult. At other times, we see his game when they don’t, as when he smiles in a charming way and invites students to open up, one on one. The student thinks he’s broken through, that the monster likes him. But we see him flicking his tail, registering information for future humiliations.Some of us went to elementary school in the days when teachers actually arranged the seating in order of intelligence, and so kids spent every day in terror of being demoted to a stupider row. Mr. Fletcher adapts that form of sadism for the conservatory, so that every “core” musician has a backup sitting behind him. The backup hopes to be elevated and then lives in fear of falling back.Simmons has the flashy role, the memorable role, the kind of role that can get an actor nominated for awards. But Simmons’ performance, at least in terms of the perception of his character, is largely determined by Teller, who plays the young drummer with a lacerating commitment. Teller’s force is not only felt in the many and vigorous drumming scenes, but also in the private moments, in which we can see just how much this teacher has crawled inside his head and rearranged his wiring. The soundtrack, full of jazz standards, is an enjoyable feature, though in the context of the movie, audiences will mostly feel anxiety hearing them. The amount of work required to sound breezy and effortless is daunting.",1
"To watch “The Glass Castle” is to feel trapped inside Jeanette Walls’ childhood. It is to feel at the mercy of a father who is brilliant and the source of all fun — a font of affection, wisdom and approval — who also is vindictive, cruel and selfish beyond all measure. To navigate the nooks and crannies of such a personality would be difficult for an adult, but for a child it’s impossible, a terrifying and scarring experience. The movie is based on Walls’ best-selling memoir of the same name, and there is a certain Stockholm syndrome quality about the film, which is its great weakness. We come away feeling that, for all Walls’ candor, Walls is protecting her father’s memory, or protecting a story that she has been telling herself and needs to believe. Yet to some extent, that weakness is also the movie’s strength, because “The Glass Castle” captures in a rare way a child’s perspective. It makes you feel what it’s like to be tiny and dealing with an all-powerful tyrant who is not only crazy but knows he has absolute license to be crazy, and enjoys that license. In this way, Walls’ story is not unique. Indeed for many of us, it dredges up memories.The role of the father gives Woody Harrelson a chance to do almost everything he does onscreen in a single performance. He is loving, tender and sweet. He is funny and engaging and miserable and lashing out, with a mean streak that’s more than a streak, that’s like a superhighway that goes from the top of his head and then past his feet and deep into hell. Harrelson swings from boundless self-love to self-hatred in this role, and he would have been better served by a film that didn’t endorse either of those inflated self-conceptions. Instead, “The Glass Castle” leans on the side of love for a man who, on the evidence presented here at least, did not deserve it.The story takes place in two time periods. In the first, in 1989, Jeanette (Brie Larson) is a gossip columnist for a major New York magazine, and she is engaged to marry a finance executive (Max Greenfield). Coming back from a fancy dinner, she sees her parents, Rex (Harrelson) and Rose Mary (Naomi Watts), rooting through garbage cans. Yes, her parents have followed her to the Big Apple, where they are living as squatters.Mostly, though, “The Glass Castle” takes place in flashback, through incidents that recount Walls’ bizarre childhood. Basically, Jeanette and her three siblings lived under the yoke of parents who were rootless, who moved from town to town, squatting in most places. Rex, who was probably bipolar, drank constantly and, in his grandiose moments, would talk about someday building a glass castle. And the mother painted pictures. Half the time, the kids went hungry.Though Rex and Rose Mary talk a good game about living outside societal norms, they are a conventional couple for their time in one crucial way: The husband is boss. Thus, Watts must give a self-effacing performance, a free spirit who pretends to be free, but who sees and accepts her constraints. This has consequences for her children, in that she provides no buffer between them and their erratic father.This is really the kids’ story, particularly Jeanette’s story, and the movie responds by finding a pair of wonderful child actresses to play Jeanette at her various stages. As the youngest Jeanette (around 7 or 8), Chandler Head watches her father with a touch of fear but mostly wonder. These emotions become more complicated by the time she is 11 or 12. In that later stage, Ella Anderson shows us a little girl who is proud of her special connection to Daddy and blossoms under his attention, but at the same time is coming into an awareness of his weaknesses, which are not just weaknesses but catastrophic flaws.There’s a great moment when the father is telling her that he would do anything for her — this, after squandering all the food money on a drinking binge and leaving the children hungry. Jeanette, ever so delicately, responds by asking, “Do you think maybe you can stop drinking?” — and he asks her to leave the room. In this household of supposed freedom, there really is only one person allowed to express an emotion, and that’s the father. Everyone else must fall in line with dad’s emotion of the day, or the minute. By the end, it seems Walls still believes that her father, for all his faults, was something wonderful, and that carries into the film in ways that don’t help. A good person and a good parent isn’t good only 50 percent of the time, when it suits his mood, or even 80 percent of the time. But then we’re all under the cloud of our childhoods and what seemed to us normal growing up.Still the spectacle of this, of beautiful, sensitive children at the mercy of damaged adults — this is what we take from “The Glass Castle.” It’s a universal awfulness rendered with truth and detail, and somehow that’s enough.

"Tom Hardy in, Locke.Tom Hardy in, Locke. Drama. Starring Tom Hardy. Directed by Steven Knight. (R. 85 minutes.)Six months after seeing the premiere of Locke at the Venice Film Festival, I remembered scenes that I never actually saw. I imagined Tom Hardy, who plays the title actor, in dramatic encounters with various characters - I could even see the other actors' faces. Only later, when reminded, did I recall that Hardy is the only person to appear onscreen over the course of the entire movie.This speaks to the effectiveness of Locke, which takes place in a car, as a man drives from Birmingham to London. All the conversations happen over the phone, as Locke talks hands free, and the voices come over the speakers. Each call is crucial, and he has much to accomplish during the drive. Everything is converging in these next few hours - the biggest job of his career, and the worst personal crisis of his life.If the journey marks a point of passage for the character, so it does for the man who plays him. Prior to this, Tom Hardy was best known for action movies - most flamboyantly as the villain, Bane, in The Dark Knight Rises - and for a horrible, tasteless romantic comedy, This Means War, in which he didn't even get the girl. Here he gets to show what he can do. Just sitting in a car talking, with two eyes on the road, he conveys a complicated nature, that of someone whose strengths and weaknesses are so bound together that it's difficult to know where one ends and one begins.This is someone with a strong will, but too strong; who has confidence, but too much; who is honest, but sometimes ought to think about lying; and whose sense of responsibility is so pristine that he's about to nail himself to a cross. In Locke, you see the slow-motion spectacle of someone's life coming apart, and it would be an empty experience if that someone were an easy mark. But as played by Hardy, Ivan Locke is a formidable character, one who doesn't have to raise his voice or alter the lilt in his polite Northern accent to convey power.Much of Locke's conversation has to do with concrete. Locke is the manager of a major construction project and an apparent expert in pouring concrete, which, as we learn, has to be handled delicately and precisely. Tomorrow is the biggest pour of his life, and part of the texture of Locke, its feeling of reality, is in hearing specific details of Locke's work, as though eavesdropping on a series of conversations. There is always more than we can fully understand, but we can follow along.In between conversations, director Steven Knight will sometimes cut to a shot of the road at night, and the headlights and streetlights look so smeary and indistinct as to suggest Locke's desolate aloneness. Everything outside is going by, as usual, indifferent to the earth-shaking, life-shaking movements taking place in that car.It would be misleading to say that Locke completely transcends its own constraints. It succeeds completely, except in the one way that would have made its success absolute: It's impossible to forget that this is a one-actor movie. Almost everyone will go in knowing that, and those who don't will catch on midway that they're watching some kind of experiment.But make no mistake, it's a good experiment, and a good movie, and a heartening one, too. Cinema is not about special effects, but about human emotion and a face in close-up. For those in doubt, Locke is the proof. ",1
"Trailer for Cloud AtlasSci-fi action. Starring Halle Berry, Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant. Directed by Tom Tykwer and Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski. (R. 172 minutes.) There is something new going on in 21st century movies, a strain of films attempting to convey the entire experience of life in a single movie. Alejandro Inárritu has tried this, with lesser (Babel) and greater (Biutiful) success, and so has Terrence Malick (The Tree of Life). Cloud Atlas, more successful than most, is the biggest effort yet in this new vein - enormous in length and scope, a film whose purpose doesn't even begin to come into focus until two hours in.  Directed by Tom Tykwer and the Wachowski siblings (Lana and Andy), and based on the novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas is unlike any other movie, so a little description is in order. It takes place in six different periods of history - the mid-19th century, the 1930s, 1973, 2012, 2144 and the distant future. There are six different stories, with different characters, and from the very beginning, the stories are intercut. One scene follows the next in no particular order, and sometimes a scene will last no longer than a minute before a shift in time and location.  There is no apparent logic to these shifts, except, perhaps, an unconscious or cinematic one. A movement or a gesture in one era will connect with a similar movement in another. At times, you might hear someone talking in voice-over, while a scene from another era is shown onscreen. Likewise, there is little or no link between the stories, except, as one comes to realize, a moral one. Cloud Atlas attempts to depict endless cycles of recurrence, the moral patterns of human existence. If that sounds ambitious and challenging, it is. The filmmakers are betting on audiences being both willing to pay close attention, as underlying connections emerge, and willing to go along for a ride, without a clue as to the destination. The filmmakers are gambling, in fact, on the intelligence and patience of the sci-fi action audience. Let's wish them luck.

(AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures, Reiner Bajo)This film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Jim Broadbent, left, and Ben Whislaw in a scene from Cloud Atlas, an epic spanning centuries and genres. The film is an epic of shifting genres and They hedge their bets by casting familiar faces - Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant - and having them turn up in a variety of roles over the course of time. Implicit in the casting is the notion that these are the same souls in different incarnations, but that's the weakest idea in the movie, and it doesn't hold up. There is no real point of contact between the characters each actor plays. A movie with this kind of jagged, one-thing-after-another structure, can only hold an audience's interest if each individual story is so compelling that each shift, from one to the next, becomes welcome. This is almost, but not completely, the case with Cloud Atlas.  The 19th century section, directed by the Wachowskis, about a young man (Jim Sturgess) who helps a stowaway slave, is of moderate interest, though it grows over time. The 20th century stories, directed by Tykwer, are better: Ben Whishaw as a young composer of genius working for a cantankerous has-been composer (Jim Broadbent) in the 1930s; Halle Berry, as a crusading reporter risking her life to uncover a scandal, in the 1970s; and Broadbent as a man trying to escape imprisonment in a nursing home, in the current time. The Wachowskis directed the two future segments, with mixed results. The story of a young replicant (Doona Bae) in Seoul, Korea, who ends up leading a revolution in 2144, is tense and moving, one of the film's highlights. But the section set in the distant future, in which Halle Berry and Tom Hanks wear animal skins and talk in a ridiculous future language, is almost unwatchable. It's this story, always a drag to come back to, that keeps Cloud Atlas on this side of greatness. Still, despite some weaknesses, a sense gradually emerges in this film- not just an idea, but a strong feeling mixed with an idea - about the dance of good and evil over time. It's a grown-up person's vision: When you're young, it's possible to believe that evil can be vanquished. As you get older, you realize that evil never stops changing shapes and faces. In Cloud Atlas, the monster can be beaten, but always comes back, but always can be beaten. There can never be a happy ending, but there can be a mature consolation that, in itself, has grandeur and is the opposite of despair. I hope Cloud Atlas finds its audience.",1
"Trailer for Killing Them SoftlyDrama. Starring Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Andrew Dominik. (R. 97 minutes.) Killing Them Softly draws a parallel between the world of street thugs and hit men and that of bankers and financiers, with a story about a crisis of confidence in a small gambling market in the fall of 2008. As Barack Obama's soaring rhetoric fills the soundtrack, we see a ratty-looking guy, who looks as if he'd slept in his clothes, walking in an abandoned stadium. The question is, which one is the real America - the one we hear about in the speech, or the one we're looking at? Guys get greedy and do stupid things. In this case, a hood-businessman (Vincent Curatola) gets the bright idea to hire two idiots - knuckleheads you wouldn't trust to squeegee your windshield - to rob players at a mob-run high-stakes card game. The immediate result? It makes everybody afraid to play cards. It freezes the market, impedes the cash flow. Something must be done to rescue the economy. Brad Pitt plays the architect of the solution, a hit man and fixer who comes to town with an idea of how to get people gambling again. He tells the representative of the card players, a mild-mannered corporate type (Richard Jenkins), that they need to kill the guys who actually did the robbery (that's obvious), but also the innocent party that most people wrongly think did the robbery. That second suggestion contains some of the brilliance of Killing Them Softly: When you have a financial crisis, confidence must be restored no matter what. Killing Them Softly, based on the George V. Higgins novel Cogan's Trade, was adapted and directed by Andrew Dominik, who made one of the finest Westerns of the last 50 years, The Assassination of Jesse James. Killing Them Softly is not a masterpiece on that scale, but it's safe to say that there is not one moment in the film that doesn't represent the director's carefully considered thought, whether we're talking about acting values, camera placement, sound or style of presentation.  In one scene, a guy has a life-and-death conversation with an associate who is high on heroin, and Dominik films it through the consciousness of the stoned person. So between lines of dialogue, Dominik shows us the kaleidoscopic vortex that the stoned guy keeps getting sucked into and out of. The effect is funny - much of Killing Them Softly is extremely funny, but never in a cute way, as in a Guy Ritchie movie, and never in a self-consciously clever way, as in Martin McDonagh's Seven Psychopaths. The humor here doesn't gloss over character; it reveals it.  Brad Pitt is in ecstasy here, despite the cool demeanor throughout. This is an actor who is never better and never happier than when he gets to be seedy, slick his hair back and wear a leather jacket. It's probably a handsome-guy thing - John Barrymore was like that, too, a leading man who loved to be a character actor. It's strange to say this about someone who has been insanely popular for 20 years, but Pitt may be coming into his own right around now. His exterior and his interior are just beginning to converge. James Gandolfini, as a hit man from out of town, appears in a pair of long scenes, both of them opposite Pitt and both directed to milk maximum tension from fairly routine situations. The beauty of Gandolfini as an actor is that he is a high-strung instrument within an imposing facade. He looks as if it would be very easy to hurt his feelings - and that would be a big mistake. There might be nothing more scary in the contemporary screen than the sight of Gandolfini smiling, while his eyes are not smiling at all. The original novel that formed the source of Killing Them Softly was published in 1974. That means that all the parallels between the story and the financial crisis are the creation of the writer-director. These parallels at first seem arbitrary, but the more you think about them, the more appropriate and heartfelt they seem. Together they make Killing Them Softly into something with an extra edge - something deeper and more ambitious than just another crime picture. ",1
"Trailer for Silent HouseThriller. Starring Elizabeth Olsen, Adam Trese and Eric Sheffer Stevens. Directed by Chris Kentis and Laura Lau. (R. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A young woman is stuck inside her house and can't escape. Intruders have bludgeoned her father, and at any second, they're going to find her. She's terrified. She's panting. Her eyes are bugging out of her head. The footsteps are coming closer. And the voices, the voices ... oh no! Yes, you've seen this movie, and Silent House is that kind of movie. And yet - pay attention, please - you have never seen anything like Silent House.  What distinguishes this film from every other horror thriller is the way it was shot. It was shot in real time and all in one take. Or, to be more precise, it was planned as a film in one take and was shot using a digital camera that simulated that illusion. If there are digital splices, or whatever they're called, they're invisible. The effect is 100 percent convincing. But breakthroughs in technique and striking displays of virtuosity matter little on their own. The main thing here is that someone has come up with a new and powerful way to film a thriller: Silent House contains no quick editing in the active moments, and there is never an instance when the movie cuts unexpectedly to something scary as the soundtrack thunders. All the tried-and-true methods of getting an audience to scream - including all the cheap stuff and the cliches - are swept away and new methods found. It turns out that filming in an endless take, while keeping the camera either on the same person or on things seen from her perspective, doesn't suppress terror; it builds it. It does so in two ways. First it increases a viewer's connection with the protagonist's helplessness. When the young woman (Elizabeth Olsen) hides inside a room hearing sounds outside the door, the audience hears and sees only what she hears and sees. There is no chance of knowing more.  Second, once the audience realizes that the movie will never ever cut away and never ever skip over a chunk of time, the audience knows it is trapped, like the protagonist, and at the mercy of an outside force. Within a remarkably short period of time, perhaps 30 minutes, Silent House feels relentless, suffocatingly tense and almost unbearable. And that's a very good thing.  Elizabeth Olsen (Martha Marcy May Marlene) never escapes the camera's scrutiny and must, over and over, keep coming up with different and visually compelling ways of looking scared out of her skull. She does this, and it's a marvel, like hearing a tenor hit a series of high C's in the same aria. We can talk all day about shots and narrative strategy and camera movements, but without a good actress at the center of all this lavish focus, the experiment would fail.  Silent House, which is based on the 2010 Uruguayan film La casa muda, is also highly effective in its use of sound and art design. Because it's shot in one long flow, we see the layout of the rooms and what's in those rooms. Everything contributes to the mood. This is another impressive achievement for filmmakers Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, the team behind Open Water (2003), which, come to think of it, was pretty frightening and unrelenting, as well.",1
"Trailer for the movie Fifty Shades Freed.Now that the trilogy is completed, it’s time to stop smirking and say a few nice things about the “Fifty Shades” series.The first is that we’ve been watching these people have sex for three movies now, and the sex hasn’t gotten boring yet, not for them, certainly, but not even for us. They’ve been strenuously keeping it interesting for three whole movies, and they deserve credit for that.The second nice thing pertains to the new installment, in particular. The opening moments of “Fifty Shades Freed” depict the wedding of the billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and the languid yet game Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). And you know how every newlywed tells you that being married somehow makes things different? Well, the marriage of the two central characters makes this movie different from its two predecessors and in ways that are helpful.The first installment in the series was a getting-acquainted story with elements of sadomasochism and bondage thrown in. The second installment was about a deepening relationship made complicated by the intrusion of a psycho who wanted to kill one or both of them. Basically, the first two films dealt in common movie tropes jazzed up by a particular sexual atmosphere.But “Fifty Shades Freed” has something extra going for it, in that it depicts something that movies and pop songs and pop culture in general tend to avoid, which is the romance of familiarity. Yes, the psycho is still loose and wants to kill both of them, especially Anastasia. But he’s mostly on the fringes of the story, adding the possibility of danger and the illusion of action, while the movie stays focused on its real business, which is all about flying to Paris on a private jet, or tending to one’s tan at an exclusive resort.At heart, this is really a movie about minor (and inevitable) honeymoon bickering, and the process of choosing a place to live and setting up a household. And yes, sure, as they drive back from their new property, they notice that the psycho is following them in a blue van, and that threat becomes the catalyst for a reasonably exciting chase scene. But the scene’s real purpose doesn’t come until they lose him, park the car and start having sex in the front seat.Has there been a movie since the 1970s — since the uncomplicated, post-syphilis and pre-herpes, pre-AIDS era of “The Harrad Experiment” — that has believed in sex this much? That has endorsed sex with such wholehearted, unabashed enthusiasm? They have sex with vibrators, sex with ice cream, sex with no props at all, and it seems like a very nice thing that these newlyweds are so into each other. “Fifty Shades Freed” arrives in a world has not stopped throwing up thinking about Harvey Weinstein, and its pagan joie de vivre comes as blessed relief from ugly thoughts of awful people.The essential thing is this: As silly as the movie is, and it’s silly in many ways, it accomplishes the fundamental task of making you believe that this is a young couple in love. At one point, Christian sits at a piano and starts playing Paul McCartney’s “Maybe I’m Amazed,” and as obvious as the moment is, it also feels right, because that song is also about the romance of familiarity. McCartney and novelist E.L. James are, in their different ways, more or less talking about the same emotions.Another nice thing about this movie, and also a curious thing: It seems to be arranged as a series of five-minute interludes, a surprising number of which are entertaining, even if they can almost feel unrelated. She has a nightmare. Then they have sex on the kitchen table. Then she visits the doctor. Then she goes to the psycho’s bail hearing. ... It’s just one thing after another, but it’s mostly fun.That’s everything good. Now for the bad part. “Fifty Shades Freed” is ridiculous. Aside from the interactions between Christian and Anastasia, the dialogue is laughable, and the turns of plot are absurd. Even the overarching story — Anastasia’s former boss at the publishing house is transformed into a homicidal maniac — is pretty much a joke.Yet it’s weird how some things in movies matter less than others. I like these people. I’m rather sorry to see this series end. ",1
"Transamerica: Comedydrama. Starring Felicity Huffman and Kevin Zegers. Directed by Duncan Taylor. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Though Huffman is not the only good thing in the movie, she brings so much to it and subtly enlivens it to the extent that it's difficult to imagine it without her. Her performance requires that she, in essence, play someone who is playing someone else. She is really Stanley, but she has become Bree thanks to a series of surgeries, a daily regime of hormones and rigorous self-discipline. She is rigid with control, consciously moderating her voice and tone and presenting only the facial expressions that she has mastered in the mirror. Huffman's shoulders carry the weight of a life spent being careful, so as to pass, so as to avoid getting beaten up, so as to avoid being treated like a freak. Significantly, Huffman does this across the sex divide. That's important to remember. She is a woman playing a man playing a woman, which requires that she not ease into playing the woman side of her own nature, even as she's playing a man who's doing everything he can to seem womanly. And that's just the beginning of what Huffman does. The gender ramifications are just part of the story. There's also the way Huffman depicts Bree reacting to her circumstances. This is a person of obvious intelligence, who is middle-aged and from a reasonably well-off family. Yet we see her working in menial jobs. What happened? Were there lost years? A drug problem? We never know, and yet again, that history is in Huffman's tense shoulders and her weary expression. She has the essence of someone who has gone through life as an alien, desperate to be known and yet hoping not to be noticed -- someone who at the same time has come into a certain self-knowledge and dignity, through mistakes and quiet suffering. This isn't critical fantasizing. This is all in the way Huffman looks, talks and moves, and she's extraordinary. What's more, it comes as a relief to find this performance in such a relaxed, human film, and not a social polemic. For most of the way, Transamerica is a quirky comedy. Bree leaves her modest apartment in Los Angeles and flies to New York, where she bails her 17-year-old son out of jail. Without identifying herself as the boy's father -- but rather as a lady from the church -- she sets about driving back across the country, hoping that she might unload the boy somewhere along the way, perhaps at his stepfather's house. The film's title refers to both transsexuality and to the journey spanning the continent. The gulf between Bree's bizarre appearance and her church-lady manner and aspirations provides the source for much of the humor, and in that sense, Bree is a little like Fred Gwynne's Herman Munster. But the movie is never mean to her. It's equally understanding of her family, including her horrified mother (Fionnula Flanagan) and rowdy, ne'er-do-well sister, who's played with self-deprecating wit by Carrie Preston. The film's intelligent compassion also extends to the son (Kevin Zegers, who is as handsome as the young Alain Delon). The son could have been just another aggrieved young wise guy, but instead we're aware of his real need for parental love. In American mythology, from Mark Twain's Roughing It through Thelma & Louise, taking off on the open road has always been an occasion for self-discovery. While Bree is not the usual hero or heroine, the road has the same salutary effect on her, and it's interesting to watch Huffman register the progress of that inner transformation. My only quibble with Transamerica, not big but nagging, is that it ends with one of the characters in a very ugly place. Even that would be all right, if the movie acknowledged that ugliness. Instead it glosses over it, as though everything were fine. -- Advisory: This film contains full frontal nudity, strong language, drug use and a false penis. ",1
"Troy: Drama. Starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Brian Cox. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen. (R. 160 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It is also not for people who have contemplated Helen of Troy and wondered at a face that could launch a thousand ships. The Helen of Troy we get here, as played by Diane Kruger, looks more like Helen of Troy, N.Y. -- a pretty girl who could easily launch a paddle boat, maybe, or a couple of canoes, but that's about all. Still, a movie that's 160 minutes long and never boring, that provides a talented cast with juicy roles and a charismatic star (Pitt) with a great showcase is not something to be buried under ridicule. Troy is all Hollywood and no Homer, but within its limits, it's a vigorous, entertaining movie. Like World War I, the epic disaster depicted here results from a simple cause, in this case the pedestrian lust of two immature youngsters: Helen, Queen of Sparta, starts having unsafe sex with a Trojan, namely Paris (Orlando Bloom), and he whisks her off to Troy, much to the consternation of her husband, King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Enraged and seeking revenge, Menelaus goes to his brother, the power-hungry Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who sees Helen's abduction as just the excuse he's been looking for to invade Troy. The movie presents Greece and Troy as cultures in opposition. The Greeks are a rowdy bunch. They're aggressive, wear dark clothes and do elaborate Star Trek-like things to their hair, while the Trojans have shorter hair, lighter clothes and a more considered demeanor. The Trojans know how to fight, but they're content to live in peace, protected within their impenetrable walls and under the rule of a just and forlorn old king (Peter O'Toole). Despite their worthiness, an undertone of sadness pervades Troy, as if the people know that 3,000 years later the Greeks will still be a nation, while they will be a brand of contraceptives. Even Hector (Eric Bana), their greatest warrior, has the pensive, subdued air of a leader smart enough to grasp that history is against him. It's a curious story, a war saga that manages to be involving without a clear-cut rooting interest, one in which each side has its share of shining lights and idiots. The greatest of the Greeks, Achilles (Pitt), embodies the evenhandedness of a tale bordering on ambivalence. Achilles despises Agamemnon, that pig of a king, and doesn't believe in the cause. When he fights, he fights only for glory, and as a warrior he has moves that no one can match. In an early scene, he leaps into the air and kills a giant with one stroke. But just as often, Achilles prefers to stay in his tent and brood. The precedent for Pitt's Achilles is not to be found in Homer but in the Hollywood anti-heroes of the 1970s. Too cool to believe politicians, too cynical to fight for an ideal, he has no hope, just a fatalistic equanimity, and believes only in courage as a value in itself. When it comes to conveying smirky confidence, cocksure heroics and the in-the-moment intensity of a lover who knows who could be dead tomorrow, Pitt is magnetic. His performance falters only when he has to convey Achilles' rage, the mysterious and thinly veiled source of this warrior's effectiveness. Pitt just can't locate the anger, not convincingly. Even so, what might, in another movie, be a serious failing doesn't matter here. Nothing gets in the way of what is essentially a fun performance in a lively adventure. As Hector, Bana suggests the decency of a rational man in an irrational age, a version of the quality that O'Toole brings to Priam, though unclouded by age or sentiment. Hector intuits that the future belongs to self-satisfied vulgarians like Agamemnon, as played by Cox. It's going to be a long 3,000 years. Director Wolfgang Petersen doesn't bring his usual gracefulness to the filming of Troy, but the film's imposing visuals make up for a certain lack of finesse: The massive city walls, the 1,000 ships sailing through the mist, the armies of soldiers as far as the eye can see. Finally, the Trojan horse, tall and angular, is given a scary, ominous look befitting both an instrument of doom and a vehicle meant to hold scores of men for many hours, centuries before the invention of indoor plumbing. -- Advisory: The film contains lots of bloody battle scenes and a couple of scenes of sensuality.

"Try to imagine a movie that could make you want to blow up a perfectly innocent, absolutely adorable little girl. Try to conceive a set of circumstances in which such an action might be acceptable to you. And then, after deciding such a thing is beyond possibility, go see “Eye in the Sky” for an education in modern warfare. Directed by Gavin Hood and written by Guy Hibbert, “Eye in the Sky” deals with the ethical questions surrounding the use of drones. At least half of the film depicts people staring at screens and arguing about what to do, and somehow this makes for intense drama. Add into that it features Helen Mirren at her icy best and Alan Rickman, who is outstanding in his last screen performance, and that should be enough to recommend it.Mirren plays a British colonel working for military intelligence who has been tracking various terrorists for several years. Now some of the most dangerous, ranking members of this terrorist organization — think the Islamic State or al  Qaeda — are going to be in the same house in Kenya. And so she coordinates with Kenyan officials on the scene and with the Americans, who have the eyes in the sky: drones capable of following the terrorists’ movements.All is going according to plan for about 15 minutes, when the terrorists go off to another house, in the middle of a district that can’t be invaded by police. The house is in a part of town run by the terrorists, and any attempt to make an arrest would result in a horrible battle, with lots of civilian casualties and the very real possibility of the lead terrorists getting away. So what starts off as an arrest plan becomes a different plan altogether — to use a Hellfire missile, fired from a drone, to blow up the terrorists in the house.The film takes place in several areas of activity. The colonel (Mirren) heads the command center, and she is ready to blow up half the world to get these terrorists, one in particular. Alan Rickman, as a general, sits in a boardroom with politicians, trying to persuade them to allow the drone strike. And Aaron Paul is the bombardier, controlling the drone from a console somewhere in the United States.Though Paul’s scenes are played straight, the idea of him as a bombardier is actually funny if you think about it. This is an actor who specializes in characters who do terrible things and then feel horribly guilty afterward. Thus, he spends half of “Eye in the Sky” with his eyes filling with tears and his face frozen and throbbing with misery. He has the kind of sensitivity that would be valued in a friend, although the thought of an American army full of guys like Paul would be pretty terrifying.In contrast with the drama of Paul’s scenes, Hibbert combines drama with black comedy in the boardroom interludes. That’s a tone that Rickman understood instinctively and played expertly, never losing the drama while injecting shadings of comedy. Watching the timid British officials do their best to avoid making decisions evokes both humor and frustration. From an American perspective, it’s also amusing that on two occasions, U.S. government officials make an appearance, and they are portrayed as having none of the reticence of their British colleagues.“Eye in the Sky” is refreshing in its lack of a political message. Mirren is chilling as the cold-blooded colonel, but her point of view is more than understandable, even justifiable, just as Paul’s reluctant soldier is both right and wrong, as well. In a situation in which a good option does not exist, the choice is only between degrees of bad, and so it’s impossible for anyone to be entirely right. The moral discussion in “Eye in the Sky” amounts to various people deciding which variety of culpability they can live with. It’s an awful place to be, and the movie puts us where we already were and didn’t quite know it — right in there with them.",1
"UNDERCOVER BROTHER: Comedy. Starring Eddie Griffin, David Chappelle, Chris Kattan and Denise Richards. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) and another. The picture is crammed with shameless satire, engaging moments of pure silliness and jokes that border on the outrageous. It combines relentless energy with an aura of good nature for a formula that works. Based on the Internet cartoon series, the movie is the story of Undercover Brother, a modern-day Robin Hood with an affection for the 1970s. He wears elephant bells, platform shoes and silk shirts with floral designs. He wears the sort of thin leather jacket that nobody ever but- tons, has his hair done in an Afro and drives around in an early '70s Coupe de Ville, with Average White Band blasting out of his eight-track player. Decked out in this way, Eddie Griffin gets a laugh just by showing up. Undercover Brother could be considered a blaxploitation version of Austin Powers, but with a difference. Austin Powers had an excuse for being a '60s throwback -- he'd been cryogenically frozen for 30 years. That detail not only explained his retro ways but also grounded the character. The audience understood that it was really seeing a '60s man. It says something that Undercover Brother doesn't even go as deep as Austin Powers. Undercover Brother derives his style from the blaxploitation films of the early '70s, but the movie never explains how such a fellow could come to exist. Nor does it milk much comedy from the ways Undercover Brother clashes with his environment. He is just a flamboyant fellow in a cartoon universe. In '70s movies, heroes like Shaft often found themselves fighting the Man.  In Undercover Brother, the title character finds himself fighting him literally. The Man is an actual person, a powerful white man whose mission is to keep the black man down and eradicate all vestiges of African American culture. In opposition to his plan is an organization called the B.R.O.T.H.E. H.O.O.D., which recruits Undercover Brother to stop the Man. Billy Dee Williams has a funny featured role as a retired general, who is clearly based on Colin Powell. The General is about to toss his hat into the presidential race, but the Man -- through his minion, Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan) -- gets to him first with a mind-altering drug. As a result, the General goes before a throng of reporters and announces that he is opening a chain of fried chicken restaurants. If you buy a bucket, you get 32 ounces of malt liquor free. Griffin is a physically fluid and adaptive comedian. Some of his best work comes when U.B. goes undercover as a buttoned-down white-collar worker who is seduced by the Man's secret weapon, the White She-Devil, played by Denise Richards. She's described as black man's kryptonite. Actually, just kryptonite would about say it. Funny as Griffin is, he's topped by David Chappelle as Conspiracy Brother, a paranoid who insists that Babe Ruth was black and that George Washington Carver made the first computer from a peanut. But even he can't quite convince himself that O.J. didn't do it. ",1
"Under the Tuscan Sun: Romantic comedy/drama. Starring Diane Lane and Sandra Oh. Directed by Audrey Wells. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Based on the best-selling memoir by Frances Mayes, Under the Tuscan Sun is a movie about second chances, about pulling up roots and switching gears in midlife in pursuit of that thing that is so important to Americans that they even put it in the Declaration of Independence: happiness. Belief in eternal possibility is very American, and the art of living was perfected in Italy, so it's inevitable that these two cultures should meet. In Under the Tuscan Sun an American woman pursues happiness in the one place on earth where it practically can't be avoided. Lane is the perfect audience surrogate for this journey, for the simple reason that she seems alive to every flicker and nuance of her surroundings. So full are her reactions in this film, and in such constant flux, that writer-director Audrey Wells can't resist leaving the camera on Lane as other people talk to her. Lane reacts to every sight and every word, as if in some heightened state of constant vibration. In adapting the book, Wells appended a romantic story and changed Mayes from married to newly divorced. Floundering in a low-grade fever of depression that's threatening to become chronic and lifelong, Frances is given a vacation to Tuscany by a friend, Patti (Sandra Oh), who knows she needs one. While there, Frances spontaneously and rather recklessly buys a 300-year-old villa in Cortona and starts renovating it. It would be easy to write off Wells' contribution to the story as a cliche - - a woman begins a new life -- and to call the entire plot of Under the Tuscan Sun a mere excuse to show us beautiful things and Lane's reaction to them. That wouldn't be so bad, anyway, since, as a travelogue, the film is fairly glorious. In addition to Cortona, we get to see Siena, Montepulciano, several locations in Positano and various streets in Rome. But the movie is more than that. The searching-for-love element that the film injects into Mayes' book is in essential harmony with the unspecified longings that Italy inspires in the traveler. If turning these longings into simple man trouble cheapens them somewhat, it also makes them more tangible and communicable. It's also fair to say that Wells devises clever scenes that often transcend the cliched situation, as in the unexpected and inventive way Frances discovers her husband's infidelity. Along the way, we get Italy: the sly yet forthright people. The thunderstorms that look and sound like biblical wrath. And magical moments, as when an owl perches on Frances' bed frame. There are also moments that embody the dream of being there, as when Frances, wearing a white dress and dark sunglasses, rides up a hill in Positano on the back of a policeman's Vespa. Part of Frances wants to be a woman out of a Fellini movie, and appropriately enough, she meets an actual Fellini actress (Lindsey Duncan), who tells of the time the maestro approached her, a teenager in the Piazza Navona, and said, You are my imagination come to life. More than just an arresting line, it raises a question that all travelers must ask themselves: When we think that we are seeing our imaginations come to life, are we really seeing a romantic projection? That's a crucial question in cross-cultural love affairs. Frances meets a handsome Italian (Raoul Bova) and can't help but laugh when he says things that sound typically Italian to her. How does one get past the projection and see the reality? Though here and there it threatens to turn into a bucolic, Italian version of Sex and the City, Under the Tuscan Sun maintains its spell. The Italian cast is excellent, especially Vincent Riotta as Frances' gentle real estate agent, Signor Martini, who could easily fall in love with her, if he allowed himself to. The only real downside to the film is what it's likely to do for Italian tourism. After this, the deluge. This film contains harsh language and sexual situations. ",1
"United 93: Drama. Starring Ben Sliney, JJ Johnson and Trish Gates. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) [Podcast: Mick LaSalle with Leba Hertz on United 93, Hard Candy and R.V.] Most of my anger was directed at the murderers depicted onscreen, but some of it had to do with the way they were initially presented. Writer-director Paul Greengrass does something in United 93 that invites controversy. He begins his film not with the passengers but with the terrorists praying in their rooms. Then he cuts to an American skyline, while prayers in Arabic are uttered in voice-over. Later, when we meet the passengers, it's almost as if through the eyes of the terrorists. This is a mistake in every possible way -- an aesthetic lapse, a lapse in taste and judgment, and something that raises the question: Does Greengrass understand the moral nature of the event he's depicting? After all, the crash of the San Francisco-bound Flight 93, in which the passengers rose up and fought the terrorists, was not just a sad but interesting thing that happened. It was a good-versus-evil story of unarmed citizens, who, in a matter of minutes -- facing the most terrifying situation imaginable -- overcame their fear, got organized and fought for their one slim shot at survival. In the process, they spared their country a cataclysmic trauma (the destruction of either the White House or the Capitol) and became heroes. Not fake heroes, not the creation of propaganda, but that rare, real thing. To do justice to that event, Greengrass' clinical and reserved approach is mainly right. The classic MGM treatment, or the schmaltzy Disney treatment, would have been demeaning to the reality of those people and what they did. But a proper reserve does not require, and is not enhanced by, an attempt to humanize the inner mechanisms of the murderers. Not only do the terrorists not deserve the dignity of being humanized in art, but any speculation, limited by the demand that art should make sense, is bound to be inaccurate. Do we really need to see one terrorist who might be a little nicer than the three others? Even if that were true, it would have nothing to do with the essential story of Flight 93, which is all about the passengers. That caveat aside, United 93 is a conscientious piece of work, made by someone who has imagined himself on Flight 93 and has tried to do right by it onscreen. He films it feverishly. The camera is always moving, probing and searching, as though looking for answers, or at least a chance to rest. Both pursuits are in vain. In some ways, particularly in the scenes of the air traffic controllers at work, United 93 functions almost in the way of a conventional thriller: The audience is privy to special knowledge and waits, in anticipation, for the characters to realize what's going on. Yet even in these scenes, Greengrass brings an extra quality of verisimilitude. I was particularly struck by the authentic performance of the actor playing Ben Sliney, the head of air traffic at Herndon, Va. Where did they find this terrific character actor, who has such authority and yet doesn't preen and seems so real? Turns out, Sliney plays himself. So do three other participants at Herndon. Likewise, Greengrass used the actual people for the key controllers at Newark Tower, as well as for the officers at the Northeast Air Defense Sector. The difference is appreciable, in terms of appearance, consciousness, regional speech and general atmosphere. There's just nothing artful about it, and it's Greengrass who deserves the credit. These nonactors don't act the way most people do when playing themselves. They act the way people do when they're being themselves. As for what happens on the airplane, it's almost too much to bear. You might think that almost five years' distance has made you ready to see this, but it's still difficult. Greengrass' approach is hyper-real. Nothing is romanticized. The camera keeps a discreet distance, and the dialogue reaches us almost as though we were overhearing it. With the exception of David Rasche, who plays Donald Greene, the cast is made up of unfamiliar faces, accomplished professional actors who are relatively unknown. They come with no past associations, so it's possible to see Alan Basche as Todd Beamer, and Cheyenne Jackson as Mark Bingham, etc. The actresses playing the flight attendants are particularly strong, especially Trish Gates as Sandra Bradshaw and Opal Alladin as CeeCee Lyles. As the crash had no survivors, everything in the movie that takes place on board is speculation, but intelligent speculation, based on a real timeline and on the many phone calls made from the plane. United 93 doesn't film the legend. The passengers look stunned, as though still adjusting to the abrupt change from normality to insanity. But they make that adjustment, and it's all the more impressive when we're reminded that these were regular people, who just minutes before thought they were having a regular day. -- Advisory: Harrowing, traumatic violence.

"Vampire movies are pretty exhausted these days. Few modern sights are more tiresome than blood on fangs. So what a surprise to find in “What We Do in the Shadows” an inspired and funny vampire comedy, one that’s more than just a smart premise but that remains fun and inventive from beginning to end.The title is flat, not clever at all, but don’t be misled by that. Also don’t avoid this film if you’re sick of vampires — you can’t be more sick of vampires than a film critic who sees them all and would love to put a stake through the whole genre. “What We Do in the Shadows” is seriously good and laugh-out-loud funny.It’s a mock documentary about four vampires who share a house in Wellington, New Zealand. The ostensible reason for the documentary is to show how they go about their lives in the days leading up to the “Unholy Masquerade,” an annual social event. Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, who wrote and directed, take this situation and commit to it, finding all the possible angles for comedy and exploiting them with prankish self-assurance. The smartest thing they do is resist satirizing vampire movies. Yes, the movie sends up all the things we know about vampires from those movies — that they can’t wear silver, don’t have a reflection, etc. — but the form the movie satirizes is that of a certain type of low-budget documentary. “What We Do in the Shadows” hits all the cliches, the camera that follows a subject from room to room, the subjects who directly address the audience, and the group conversations that take on a certain artificiality because a camera is there.What this means is that the movie is almost always funny for two reasons simultaneously, even if you don’t quite realize it. It’s funny because of the absurdity of vampires in this context. And it’s funny because the context itself is hackneyed to begin with, even if we’ve never thought so until now.The four vampires are from different eras. There’s Viago (Waititi), a neat freak from the 17th century; Vladislav (Clement), a once-powerful vampire from the Middle Ages; Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), a relative youngster from the Empire era, and Petyr (Ben Fransham), a Nosferatu look-alike from 8,000 years ago. Vampires may live indefinitely, but “What We Do in the Shadows” assumes that a certain rigidity and waning of enthusiasm sets in after the first thousand years.Typical of the filmmakers’ willingness to go with the premise, the movie reminds us that not being able to see one’s reflection can be a challenge when dressing to go out. They have to keep trying  on different outfits until the others approve. At one point, Viago puts on a cherished silver locket and grimaces as it starts to burn through his skin.Viago is the focus of another very funny scene, in which he is in his house with a victim, who thinks she is simply on a first date. As she talks about her future plans, she is oblivious that he’s putting newspaper and towels down all around her — to prevent the inevitable mess when her blood starts shooting all over the place.Fairly early, a story of sorts kicks in, so there’s no sense of random bits being tossed off, but of forward motion throughout. This keeps “What We Do in the Shadows” from losing steam. It should be noted that some werewolves also make an appearance, and they’re as funny as the vampires.",1
"Vanity Fair: Comedy-drama. Starring Reese Witherspoon, James Purefoy, Romola Garai and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Directed by Mira Nair. (PG-13. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) She certainly does that. With Witherspoon in the role, we understand, without requiring any explanation, that Vanity Fair is an essentially upbeat story, even though it's about a 19th century orphaned girl forced to live by her wits in a culture that would just as soon toss her into the gutter. Witherspoon's feistiness, intelligence and resiliency allow us, from the beginning, to put our money on Becky. Witherspoon is in many ways like Miriam Hopkins, who starred in the 1935 Becky Sharp, a Vanity Fair adaptation remembered today only for being one of the first color features. Like Hopkins, Witherspoon is American and Southern, little, smart and loquacious, with a smile that's engaging without being entirely reassuring. What she lacks is the edge of malice Hopkins brought to the role, the anger under the high spirits that served Hopkins particularly well in the first scene, in which Becky is released from a girl's school that has exploited her for years. In the new Vanity Fair, that scene is a pale shadow. But Witherspoon has her own approach to the part, and it wears well. Her Becky is not just shrewd and hungry. She has also an instinct for life, a quality that encompasses a gift for survival but is bigger than merely that. Witherspoon's Becky has the gifts of extra confidence, extra energy, extra strength, extra drive, extra instinct. She operates on a level that others can't touch, and sometimes she gives the impression that, instead of rolling over other people, she'd really rather share her gifts and have some company in these higher reaches of human function. The movie is the tale of Becky's adventures, an episodic saga that covers a couple of decades and includes many opportunities and reversals. In sentimental novels, 19th century heroines want love, security and a decent husband. Becky wants what heroes want: money, success and glory. She has no specific talent, just a lot of personality and a sense of mission. She gets her first foothold in the home of a childhood friend, Amelia (Romola Garai), and soon meets the people she'll be dealing with over the years. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers gets one of his patented roles as Georgie, Amelia's fiance, the posturing son of a rich merchant. No one can play rich, scowling snobs as well as Rhys-Meyers, who has a talent for making audiences hate him and yet feel for him at the same time. He suggests a vulnerability within Georgie, whose aristocratic ambitions have all to do with wanting to escape the shadow of a cruel, greedy father (Jim Broadbent). Becky's trajectory allows her to witness the upper reaches of London society, from the merchant class all the way to the king. Along the way she meets Pitt the Elder, a slovenly fellow with an estate in disrepair (lustily played by Bob Hoskins). On the other end of the spectrum, she gets to know the icy Lord Steyne, whose salon is at the center of London society. It's Gabriel Byrne, as Steyne, who gets off one of the film's best lines. He turns on a member of his family and yells, There's no one in this household who doesn't wish you dead. A good, all-purpose putdown. Besides Witherspoon, the strongest impression is made by James Purefoy as Rawdon Crawley, a manly and sincere soldier who, in peacetime, is just as manly and sincere but rather useless, a gambler who's not all that lucky. But then he's lucky in love. Crawley's leave-taking of Becky, before the battle of Waterloo, is the film's single most heartfelt moment by far, the one place where the movie becomes more than clever and goes to a more human place. Vanity Fair is inevitably a feminist tale, because Becky will not be kept down. But there's another way of looking at the story, which doesn't preclude the feminist treatment, and which seems potentially richer. That's to acknowledge the story's dark side, its inescapable revelation that in 19th century England a woman had to be a genius to achieve success -- or even to fight life to a draw. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and scenes of battle.

"Vera Drake: Drama. Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Directed by Mike Leigh. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) But something in Leigh's wholehearted endorsement of the heroine seems too sincere, even willfully naive, which is the last thing one would usually say about the director of Naked and Secrets and Lies. His film tells the story of a British abortionist, circa 1950, who is portrayed as such a saint that at times the movie begins to feel like a put-up job, a history of the world according to Planned Parenthood. This limited take on the protagonist prevents Vera from growing under our scrutiny. She is essentially, in the end, what she was at the beginning. Yet reservations about Leigh's treatment and presentation of Vera do not extend to Imelda Staunton, who attacks the role with a selfless immersion. As played by Staunton, Vera is none too bright, but she has an instinct for people and the kind of profound generosity that can be found only in supremely confident individuals. When Vera sees a lonely bachelor (Eddie Marsan), she invites him over to have dinner with her family. It never occurs to her that he might not want to be bothered. She embraces everyone she meets and assumes, without expecting them to embrace back, that a hug is always welcome. Has ever a filmmaker so stacked the deck to make us like someone? Vera works every day as a cleaning lady, then visits shut-ins on the way back to her flat, where she cooks a delicious meal for her family -- and sings while she's about it. Yet in the moment of watching, there's no sense of being manipulated. We notice instead the details, the dreariness of the sick people's flats, Vera's old coat and kerchief and the fact that she is always in motion, always working. Vera's kitchen table is small, her dining room is cramped, and her face is so glowing with goodness that a viewer doesn't know whether to glow back or scream. It's all so unbearably poignant. The abortions are presented almost in passing, as part of Vera's life of service. She is the good-humored auntie who shows up at the homes of distressed young women and says, Take your knickers off and lie down. She does her job, then flits off like a fairy godmother, never to return. It's a theatrical cliche that there are no small parts, but in Vera Drake there really aren't any. This is a direct consequence of Leigh's writing method -- he derives much of his script through actor improvisations. This results in characters that don't in any obvious way cooperate with the scenario but rather have full personalities and complicated moral natures. Take, for example, Vera's sister-in-law, played by Heather Craney. We know that she's sensual, competitive, needy and doesn't like Vera. We don't need to know all that, but maybe Leigh would say we do. She's part of the texture and someone we remember. But in staying true to form, Leigh at times risks self-parody. His propensity for plain-looking actors playing humble characters leads him into depicting the romance between Vera's withdrawn daughter (Alex Kelly) and a painfully withdrawn suitor as something about as interesting as a union of single-celled organisms. They are just two simpering globs of English protoplasm. He also undercuts the drama of the police's coming for Vera by having their fateful arrival preceded by banal dinner-table conversation. Still, it's worth the wait to see the unforgettable close-up of Staunton, as Vera turns to find the police in her flat. With barely a change of expression, she goes from curiosity, to concern, to frozen panic, horror and terror. Alas, Leigh depicts Vera as so devastated, so incapacitated by fear and grief, that some moments in Vera Drake pass through tragic and dance right on the border of funny. Vera may be saintly, but she's also a dangerous fool, and yet no one in the film quite admits this, and Vera never discovers it. Leigh thinks his movie is a social commentary, but it's really an almost-brilliant character study, with an essential piece left out: the moment Vera is revealed to herself. -- Advisory: This film contains mature themes.

"Veronica Guerin: Drama. Starring Cate Blanchett, Ciaran Hinds and Gerard McSorley. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Congratulations to director Joel Schumacher and screenwriter Carol Doyle for not including the typical Hollywood scene, which usually comes right before the climax, in which the protagonist sums up why she's willing to sacrifice all. As played by Cate Blanchett, Guerin's motives cannot fully be surmised, even by herself. She's an altruist, to be sure, but also a careerist, a noodge and an extrovert with a relentless competitive streak. Blanchett's performance is a paradox in that it's a deeply involving study of a woman skating on the surface of her own personality. Veronica is a charmer who tries compulsively to work everyone -- her husband, her bosses, the police, even her enemies. She runs all day and writes all night and maintains a brave front, partly to protect the people around her but partly to keep people from telling her to slow down. Her determination not to look inside is part of a conscious effort to avoid facing her fears, but we sense that something else is going on, too: She's trying not to discover that thing in her personality that makes her seek danger in the first place. From the beginning, Veronica has a touch of the smart aleck who can't resist revealing how shrewd she is and how much she knows, even when she should really keep quiet. When we first meet her, she's gloating about winning a reckless-driving court case that might have resulted in her license being revoked. She brags while on the phone, speeding. But there's a serious side to this brilliant chatterbox, one that's moved and horrified by the sight of Dublin slum kids playing in the street with discarded hypodermic needles. She can't get it out of her head, and so she makes it her mission to go after the dealers. She starts with nothing. She just walks into an abandoned house and interviews addicts. But soon she becomes adept at reading records and following money trails -- she becomes a great reporter and a dangerous nuisance. Veronica Guerin is a David and Goliath story and a tale of good versus evil, but what gives it extra heft is that we really like her and we can't stand them. Her chief nemesis, Gilligan (Gerard McSorley), is a pathetic little dictator, an out-of-control bully with a harridan for a wife and a harem of drunken bimbos. His associate Traynor (Ciaran Hinds) is a big hulk of a guy, but he's scared -- of Gilligan and also of Veronica. These guys have the henchmen and the power, yet they're terrified of this middle-class wife and mother. The ending we know going in. The movie's surprises, for those unfamiliar with the real-life drama, have to do with how far the dealers are willing to go in threatening Veronica and how much she is willing to ignore. (The details won't be revealed here.) Our sense that Veronica's pursuit is just a little bit neurotic and even possibly not worth it makes it all the more interesting, emphasizing the protagonist's unique nature while lending a note of ambiguity. Aside from one lapse into sentimentality -- immediately after the climax, our ears are assaulted by a boy soprano singing a bad Irish ballad in a piercing voice -- Joel Schumacher has crafted a smart, brisk thriller. More than that, he's given us a compelling character study and a celebration of a kind of modern woman who just did not exist a few generations ago: competent, professional, living on a cell phone, working into the night. A fraction of the people who see Kill Bill or Charlie's Angels will see Veronica Guerin, but this is the real girl-power movie. ",1
"W.: Comedy. Starring Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Banks and James Cromwell. Directed by Oliver Stone. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) After nearly eight years in office, George W. Bush is still a mystery. How smart is he? How dumb is he? Does he have regrets about the way his presidency has gone, or is he as impervious as his facade? Does he care? Is he really a nice guy? Is he really a horrible guy? Is he a religious person, or is that just a pose?  Love him or hate him, everyone has his or her own Bush, and so no screen portrayal of the president will satisfy everyone. But it's safe to say that the Bush depicted in Oliver Stone's W. - and the movie itself - will put off viewers who approve of the president and at least amuse those who consider him a disaster. Harding was not a bad man, Alice Roosevelt Longworth once said of another president. He was just a slob. And that's basically Stone's angle on Bush. The film presents him as a black sheep who drank away his youth, glided on family connections and embroiled the country in a needless, catastrophic war. Stone's viewpoint has its limitations: There's a shrewdness about the real-life Bush that is only hinted at in Josh Brolin's portrayal, and extant videos show that the young Bush was a lot more charming and charismatic than the hyperactive fool presented here.  Then again, if the young Bush were truly as confident as he seemed, why was he drinking heavily until he was 40 years old? Surely, there was something dark underneath the surface, which the movie attempts to bring to light.  The younger Bush's lifelong struggle with his father forms the psychological underpinning of W. What was it like to be the drunken no-good son of a war hero/successful businessman/congressman and, later, president of the United States? What was it like to be the despised son in a family of high achievers? Brolin, who himself knows what it's like to have a celebrated father, tears into the Oedipal aspect of the role. W.'s pain, shame, embarrassment and resentment are all made real. The movie is less sure-footed when it comes to W.'s religious conversion. As a psychologically astute director, Stone understands the ways that Bush used his Higher Father to ward off and fortify himself against his biological father. But Stone is too secular to get a handle on what it's like for a world leader to sincerely believe he's God's chosen instrument. Stone doesn't convey the charismatic, but dangerously delusional confidence, that such conviction might inspire. As such, W. remains a secular portrait of a man who saw himself only partly in secular terms. Still, Stone's Bush is only a first step, and no doubt other Bush movies will fill in more of the picture. In the meantime, Stone gets more than enough to keep his film fascinating from beginning to end. The screenplay, written by Stanley Weiser, follows two tracks, with scenes of the lead-up to the Iraq war in 2002 and 2003 interspersed with scenes from Bush's early life. We watch the young Bush from his college days through his decision to run for president, in 1999, when he tells his pastor that God is calling him. Along the way, we meet the various people in Bush's life. James Cromwell gives the film's standout performance as George H.W. Bush, playing him as a serious, decent man who is at a loss when it comes to his oldest son - and ultimately ashamed of what W. does on the world stage. Cromwell is the one actor who makes no effort to sound like his real-life counterpart, nor does he look like the elder Bush, except in terms of height and weight. But he conveys his gravity, simplicity and essential decency.  The rest of the actors are immediately recognizable in their roles. Toby Jones is a sly Karl Rove, shorter than the real-life Rove but conveying the same impish self-satisfaction. Elizabeth Banks makes a lovely Laura Bush. Jeffrey Wright is Colin Powell, out of his depth and outnumbered in Cabinet meetings by the war faction, led by Richard Dreyfuss as a formidable Dick Cheney. As Stone's point of view is decidedly anti-war, Don Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn) and Assistant Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz (Dennis Boutsikaris) hardly come in for friendly treatment. But the one Stone really has it in for is Condoleezza Rice, who gets it worse than anybody.  At least Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz are portrayed as people with strong opinions. Rice is presented as a mere fawning appendage, who sits trying to read the president's mind so as to agree with him in advance. Thandie Newton looks as much like Rice as Tina Fey looks like Sarah Palin, and her performance is the funniest and meanest element of the movie. Indeed, mean or not, Newton alone is worth the price of admission.  In the end, W. makes up in immediacy what it lacks in objectivity. Perhaps years from now, the film may play like an in-joke between a filmmaker and his audience. Yet even then, future audiences will have to appreciate the daring nature of what Stone is attempting: to put the national trauma known as the Bush years into historical and psychological perspective, even as they're still going on. -- Advisory: Strong language and a future president getting rowdy.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"WALL-E: Animation. With the voices of Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight and Jeff Garlin. Directed by Andrew Stanton. (G. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.)What we have with WALL-E is 45 minutes of a masterpiece and another 50-odd minutes of dithering - there as a concession that you can't market a 45-minute movie. This means that the experience of WALL-E is a little different from what audiences will take away from it. In the moment, it's intermittently transcendent, heartrending and beautiful ... and busy, repetitious and boring. But in memory, WALL-E should grow, because the weaker parts will drop out of mind, while the moments of sheer brilliance, which are one-of-a-kind, will gain in importance.Philosophically and emotionally, this is probably the most profound animated film ever made or attempted. In terms of subject, it's not unlike the never-filmed screenplay that James Agee wrote for Charlie Chaplin in the 1950s, in which the Little Tramp is the last survivor of a nuclear blast. It's a mark of the Pixar team's artistry, which goes way beyond technical expertise, that within minutes of meeting WALL-E, a wordless, trash-compacting robot, we are persuaded to invest in him much of the feeling that we'd attach to a Chaplin character. Think about that for a second. Think how amazing that is.In fact, they've hooked us before we even meet WALL-E. The movie opens with the song Put On Your Sunday Clothes (from Hello, Dolly) playing over pictures of outer space. The slight echo given to the song conveys that this is something from long ago, the sonic equivalent of light emanating from a dead star. The song bespeaks a world of unclouded optimism (Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there). But as the camera moves in on Earth and focuses in on a major American city, we see utter devastation, empty skyscraper remnants and massive piles of geometrically arranged trash.WALL-E is the robot who compacts the trash and places it on the piles. He has one friend, a cockroach, who's the only thing left living (cockroaches can survive almost anything), and, all in all, it's a bleak existence in a desolate landscape. But here's the touch of genius: WALL-E collects things. Whenever he sees something he finds interesting, something that he somehow intuits isn't trash, he puts it in an old cooler and brings it home. WALL-E is drawn to signs of life; thus, his fascination with his old VHS of Hello, Dolly, which he watches obsessively.For as long as it stays on Earth, WALL-E is a great film, and on its way to being one of the masterpieces of the decade. But then it leaves Earth, and, once it does, it goes into pedestrian territory. WALL-E and a companion probe named Eve (who is very white and sleek and looks like something made by Apple) go back to Eve's spaceship. They go to bring back a small plant that indicates that Earth can once again sustain life. The spaceship scenes are not without charm or imagination. The spaceship contains all that's left of humanity, thousands of people living on the equivalent of a luxury liner, with all their needs attended to by robots. Because they're lazy and never need to move, the people are all enormously fat. The spaceship has become its own culture, having been flying, with the human species in exile, for 700 years. Once WALL-E and Eve arrive on the ship, the story doesn't have much distance to travel, but ways are found to stretch out the experience - and that's where WALL-E goes wrong. The film loses touch with the poignancy and profundity of the Earth scenes and becomes gimmicky, slapsticky and cute, with a glossy sheen in contrast to the grit of the opening. However, the movie does right itself, and the power of WALL-E as a character, the poetic figure of the robot drawn to human splendor, remains powerful throughout - and Pixar's loveliest creation. ",1
"Waging a Living: Documentary. With Jean Reynolds, Jerry Longoria, Barbara Brooks and Mary Venittelli. Directed by Roger Weisberg. (Unrated. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Weisberg follows five people over the course of several years: Jean Reynolds, a nursing assistant supporting three kids and seven grandchildren on 11 dollars an hour; Barbara Brooks, who's supporting three kids as a counselor, while going to school for her associate's degree; Mary Venittelli, a woman with three kids, who drops from comfort into poverty following a divorce; and the lone West Coast entry, Jerry Longoria, a security guard in San Francisco. The four subjects are engaging and intelligent, fighting long odds and working extra hours, living without health care and having no time for rest and little for sleep. The struggle is unrelenting, the stories poignant. Among the many revelations in Waging a Living is the surprising fact that those security guards, working the desks in the lobbies of Market Street's most opulent office buildings, are making 10 and 11 bucks an hour -- in San Francisco. The intent of Waging a Living is to inspire outrage, and to an extent it succeeds. But in every country, somebody's going to be broke, and the film sometimes overestimates the shock we should feel that people with no education or skills and lots of kids should be feeling the squeeze. After all, it's hardly esoteric information that dropping out of school and having children early is a recipe for poverty. A viewer could easily come away, in fact, consoled that there are so many programs to help people who find themselves at a disadvantage. Likewise, though the government's efforts to wean people off of the system sometimes results in dispiriting situations like Barbara Brooks' (she gets a $450 raise and loses $600 in aid), it's not unreasonable that there should be incentives for people to get off assistance. However, the film makes two points so persuasively as to seem beyond dispute. The first is that fathers are getting away scot free, that there's no system for tracking down deadbeat dads and that court-ordered child support is often treated as something optional. The second is that people who work hard should be able to get ahead, that it's unfair and un-American that, in a nation founded on the idea of the second chance, people can't climb their way out of poverty. That's the point of the film -- people who work hard should have a decent life -- and it's hardly unreasonable. It's the way it used to be, after all. Sixty-five years ago even the soda jerk in Meet John Doe got to live in a house. ",1
"Waist Deep: Action. Starring Tyrese Gibson and Meagan Good. Directed by Vondie Curtis-Hall. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) They come about by craft, by placing the right people in front of the camera, cutting everything extraneous and keeping things moving. Writer-director Vondie Curtis-Hall, teamed with co-writer Darin Scott, devises a compelling situation, puts a convincing hero at the center of it and then teams him with a beautiful girl. Got a problem with that formula -- boy and girl in a car, chasing bad guys, getting chased by bad guys? That's Preston Sturges, that's Godard, that's practically every urban adventure, good and bad, ever made. Waist Deep isn't one of the better exemplars of the old formula, but it catches the freewheeling spirit. It moves that spirit into the 'hood, where an ex-con who goes by the moniker O2 (Tyrese Gibson) is trying to make good as a security guard. He leaves work one afternoon to pick up his son from school, and for about 20 whole seconds, it looks fun to be riding through the 'hood in a convertible, listening to hip-hop. Then the boy takes a gun out of his father's glove compartment and the music stops, as the question rises: How is this man going to protect his son in this dangerous environment? One clue: It's not going to be as a security guard. Waist Deep wastes no time getting its pieces into place. Within minutes, O2's car is hijacked, with his son inside it, and within seconds O2 is established as a dangerous guy, running down the middle of the street killing people, while trying to catch the carjacker. Upon reflection, I'm not even sure who he's killing, or why, but then, do you really need to know all the lyrics to Blueberry Hill to know it's a good song? The energy and the audacity matter a lot more. The only important thing to know is that O2's son has been kidnapped and that the man behind it -- a gang kingpin known as Meat (played by the rapper The Game) -- is a highly unpleasant individual. Curtis-Hall conveys this with great economy by showing Meat, 10 seconds into his first scene, cutting off part of a guy's hand. Meat is at the center of every illegal operation in his part of Los Angeles, while O2 is a wanted man, with no connections and no power. He has only one ally, a sexy hustler named Coco (Meagan Good), who becomes his partner in trying to bring Meat down. Gibson and Good aren't household names, but they're as attractive a pair as you could hope to find. He's a sturdy leading man; she's gorgeous and funny; and both have the kind of authority that holds the screen. If they don't go on to bigger things, something is very wrong. They work well off of each other, a necessary thing, as most of the movie consists of the two riding around, devising their plan and putting it into place. That the plan is ridiculous doesn't matter. That it would never work doesn't matter. What matters is that their plan results in a succession of flashy scenes -- of unexpected and lurid encounters that are carried off with panache and a touch of humor. Sure, there's probably no good reason to watch Waist Deep. But if you start watching it, Waist Deep gives you no good reason to stop. It doesn't even give you a moment to think about it. -- Advisory: Strong language, sexual situations and graphic violence. ",1
"Walk Hard:The Dewey Cox Story: Musical comedy. Starring John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Raymond J. Barry and Kristen Wiig. Directed by Jake Kasdan. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.) It's just the way it is. Sometimes you can't wait to see an inspirational movie about a guy paralyzed from head to toe (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) or have an existential experience with a movie about a psychotic murderer (No Country for Old Men). And then there are other times, when an odd impulse takes over, and all you want to do is watch John C. Reilly freaking out down the street in his underwear, playing a rock 'n' roll idol on LSD.  Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is a joke machine and a nice change from the better but almost uniformly downbeat movies out there this season. A biopic satire, it's about nothing but its laughs. The songs may be good - well-made pastiches of various musical genres and eras - and John C. Reilly is wonderfully ridiculous as a lunkheaded music legend. But whenever the jokes begin to sag, and fortunately that's not often, the movie has no reason for being. It's no stand-alone piece of work, either: If you haven't seen Walk the Line, there's really no point in seeing this movie. But those caveats aside, Walk Hard is 100 minutes of fun, and for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, it's the movie to see right now. It could have grown tiresome after a half hour. It would have, if Walk Hard only parodied the predictable story lines of pop music biopics. But Judd Apatow and director Jake Kasdan, who collaborated on the screenplay, go beyond that. They parody the actual strategies that filmmakers employ in telling these stories, and their close attention to these lazy conventions provide them with a constant source of laughs. They take little things we've all seen many times and emphasize them into absurdity. For example, whenever a famous real-life person is introduced into a biopic, the screenwriters have to figure out a way to slip in the character's name so that audiences understand who's who. So here, when Dewey meets Buddy Holly, Holly's name is repeated several times. The same goes for when he meets Elvis and later, at the dawn of his LSD phase, the Beatles. The names are repeated over and over so that absolutely no one can miss them. Another convention sent up is the bathroom crack-up scene, in which the rock legend, upon receiving some distressing news, takes it out on a bathroom sink. In real life, it generally doesn't occur to people to rip out plumbing when they feel sad, but we know from movies that that's exactly what rock legends do. In Walk Hard, Dewey Cox rips out about a dozen bathroom sinks, and it gets funnier each time.  The story is told as a long flashback, as Dewey contemplates his life before going onstage for a tribute concert. Like Johnny Cash and Ray Charles, Dewey had a brother when he was a boy, his father's favorite, and as soon as we see the brother we know: That kid is dead. To emphasize this point, the script has the brother talking about all the great things he's going to do with the limitless years he has ahead of him.  Dewey moves from rockabilly to rock 'n' roll, has flirtations with punk and disco, and has a full-blown protest period. His drugs change as his music changes. There's an Elvis-type song, a Roy Orbison-type song and, most hysterically, a Dylanesque number, a folk ballad with nonsensical lyrics. Reilly does an excellent Dylan imitation and is a convincing singer throughout. He plays Dewey as a reckless child-man in search of the love he never got from his father (Raymond J. Barry), a harsh parent who never tires of saying, The wrong kid died.  Reilly gets good comic support from the women in Dewey's life. Kristen Wiig's role satirizes the thankless depictions of first wives in biopics. (I'm starting to believe you don't believe in me, he tells her.) Jenna Fischer brings comedic precision and a sense of contained but ever-present mischief to Darlene, as Dewey's religious second wife, a send-up of Reese Witherspoon as June Carter in Walk the Line.  Perhaps the strangest thing about Walk Hard is that, in following the form of biopics and carting out all their tricks, the movie ends up partaking of some of their power, even while holding them up to ridicule. It's weird. Dewey doesn't exist, and the character is a ludicrous amalgam of stereotypes, but by the end you might actually start feeling something for him. It just shows that there's a reason for the biopic formula: It's indestructible.  -- Advisory: This film contains full frontal male nudity, simulated sex, female nudity, drug use and strong language.",1
"Walk the Line: Drama. Starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by James Mangold. (PG-13. 136 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Yet once that disappointment is observed and registered, it's possible to appreciate Walk the Line for the substantial thing it is, a passionate, warts-and-all chronicle of an extraordinary American artist, not to mention a love story that can't be beat. Phoenix isn't Cash, but he clearly made a study of Cash's stage manner, and when he's not singing, it's possible to pretend. What's more, the movie provides a showcase for one of the year's great performances, Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, the woman who became Cash's second wife. With Witherspoon, there's no need for pretending. A whole review could be eaten up talking about what's great about Witherspoon in Walk the Line. At the very least, a few points must be made: Just technically, she's astonishing. She sounds uncannily like Carter. She sings just like her, in terms of style, and when she stands in front of a microphone, she suggests the ease of someone who has appeared onstage since childhood. Somehow Witherspoon conveys that backstory of a life spent in the business. It's there in the gracious way she handles (and gets rid of) fans and in the unfazed and professional way she depicts a woman going about her job. But she does much more. From the beginning, when Cash first meets June backstage on his first tour, he responds to her fearless energy and forthright intelligence. Because of the intensity of his gaze, of his fascination for her, it's only natural that the audience should become fascinated, too. But Witherspoon doesn't coast on this, and we soon become even more aware of how she's looking at him. It's a complicated look, one that makes it completely understandable why Cash felt he had to marry her: She sees through him. She knows he's a mess. She knows he's special. She sees how he might fall apart and how he might blossom into greatness. And she's tracking his progress in each direction. For her, Cash is an iffy proposition, but for Cash, the choice is obvious: Either he marries her or resigns himself to going through life without anyone fully knowing him. All this we get from Witherspoon. The movie shows the uphill nature of Cash's climb. His childhood in Arkansas is hardscrabble and grim. Through his sympathetic and musical mother, he learns gospel songs, but his father (Robert Patrick), a malevolent hick, verbally abuses him. In the Army, he learns to play guitar and writes some songs, but life as a musician is a far-off dream until he auditions one day for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records. The audition scene is strong -- Phillips shames Cash into doing his best -- but it's undercut by Phoenix's shaky singing. The film presents the life of a touring musician as exhilarating but hardly glamorous; a succession of cheap motels and long drives through the night. When Cash returns home to his first wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), she's not interested in hearing about life on the road and even announces her new rule that he's not allowed to talk about it. The movie does a hatchet job on the first wife, who, among other crimes, is so clueless that she tells Johnny not to wear black. Johnny's growing dependence on prescription drugs, the expansion of his career and his continued interest in June become the story of Walk the Line. Maybe it didn't really happen this way -- maybe it's just shrewd screenwriting on the part of Mangold and Gill Dennis -- but they shape these elements into a cohesive narrative by making everything a subset of Johnny's attraction to June: He writes songs about June, so his career expands. He can't get June -- he's married, she's married -- and so he turns to drugs. The one thing the movie gives too little attention to is the obstacle presented by their religious faith. Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to alienate a secular audience, but Cash and Carter's Christianity had everything to do with the slow way they got together and plenty to do with their bond once married. (It also had a lot to do with his outreach to prisoners.) When Carter wrote Ring of Fire, about the lust she felt for Cash, she didn't pull that metaphor out of thin air. Still, Walk the Line is worthy of its subjects, and that's saying a lot. -- Advisory: This film contains drug use and sexual situations. ",1
"Watch the trailer for Bel Ami.Drama. Starring Robert Pattinson, Uma Thurman, Kristin Scott Thomas and Cristina Ricci. Directed by Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A fate worse than obscurity is to become famous for being a goofball, a fate that Robert Pattinson can safely be said to have avoided - first with Water for Elephants and now, finally and completely, with Bel Ami. From this day on, Pattinson cannot be written off as the pale, neurasthenic fellow who would really like to kiss Kristen Stewart in the Twilight movies, but he's afraid he'll rip her veins out.  In fact, if Bel Ami is any indication, Pattinson should be known as a very good actor. In Bel Ami, based on the novel by Guy de Maupassant, he is that perennial favorite of 19th literature, the poor boy who comes to the big city with absolutely nothing but a ruthless determination not to stay poor. What distinguishes Pattinson in the role is the sense he conveys of someone roiling and churning beneath a surface that is almost, but not quite, calm.  At various times in Bel Ami, Pattinson registers unexpressed terror, shame, rage and scorn, so that it is impossible not to recognize and even start to feel his tension and to understand the life-and-death consequences behind his every interaction. Young Georges (Pattinson) has nothing and yet finds himself traveling in upper-class Parisian circles - with people who have everything, who know his every move in advance and who would be just as happy to see him land back in the gutter.  Georges' one advantage, which he makes increasing use of, is that he is attractive to women. He knows that it's through women - and their kind recommendations - that he can worm his way into the good graces of their powerful husbands. Uma Thurman has a central part as the gifted wife of a journalist, a woman ahead of her time, who takes an interest in Georges and suggests he pursue a newspaper career. It's a curious thing to see Thurman acting the wise, husky-voiced older woman to Pattinson's green young man. The role suits her.  Also going one-on-one with Pattinson are Kristin Scott Thomas and Christina Ricci, pulling back from their usual archness to play patrician women who take an interest in the beautiful boy.  With his transparent thoughts and his odd way of moving his lips before any sound comes out of them, Pattinson is an idiosyncratic leading man, two parts James Dean to one part Tony Perkins. It's a pleasure to watch him onscreen and wait for the explosion. ‌‌",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Ajami. Drama. Starring Shahir Kabaha and Scandar Copti. Directed by Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani. In Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles. (Not rated. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Ajami is an immersion into a very specific and complicated subculture, the Ajami neighborhood in Jaffa. A crime drama from Israel - and an Academy Award nominee in this year's foreign film category - it presents a rough neighborhood where Jews, Christians and Muslims live and work with each other but where cultural traditions lock them into separate worlds.Yaron Shani, a Jewish Israeli from nearby Tel Aviv, and Scandar Copti, a Palestinian Israeli from Jaffa, wrote and directed the film. Their fascination with this neighborhood is in every frame of Ajami, but that fascination is not always contagious. The film is long and sometimes confusing, and the reliance on amateur actors and extemporaneous dialogue at times creates a laborious documentary feeling. Yet even more often, the filmmakers' approach pays off with novel scenes that go in unexpected directions. And for all the latitude the directors may have given their actors in terms of dialogue, the complex story line is carefully constructed and rigorously plotted.It's a strange thing about Ajami. In many ways it could be South Central Los Angeles, or Compton, or parts of Brooklyn. When people are poor and live in tight spaces, they band together into factions and then find themselves at odds with other factions. Not surprisingly, there are street gangs in Ajami. Only the details are different, the languages and religious and cultural traditions, as well as the adherence to these traditions. Religion is taken very seriously, and the cultural differences are ingrained, going back many hundreds of years.At its best, Ajami shows you things you never would have considered or imagined. You know how in Mafia movies, when two parties have a dispute, they have a sit-down in front of a higher-up made guy? Apparently, in Islamic culture they have the equivalent of that, but it's all handled in religious terms. The disputants go before a holy man/judge, who, according to strict rules, devises a financial settlement. This scene comes early in Ajami and announces the terms of this world - exotic, devout and crooked.It's a film that rewards close attention, involving disparate characters whose lives intersect over the course of several chapters. There are flashbacks, and still other scenes that might be flashbacks. In the end, everything fits together. Shahir Kabaha plays a young Arab Israeli, who is targeted for death by Bedouin gangsters and has to broker a peace before his entire family is wiped out. If that's not enough complication in his life, he's in love with Hadir (Ranin Karim), who is also Arab, but a Christian Arab, and he's Muslim. No one marries outside the faith. Co-filmmaker Scandar Copti lends an engaging, humane presence to the role of Binj, a sophisticated, well-off Palestinian who just wants to have a good time and move in with his Jewish girlfriend. But he keeps getting hounded by the Israeli police.Throughout Ajami, the situations are impossible, but the people are mostly well meaning, and the simple things they want out of life are not unreasonable or impossible. If there's hope here, it's that basic humanity might overcome the arbitrary rules and divisions that people create for themselves. But really, this could go either way.-- Advisory: Strong language (in subtitle), violence, drug use.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Brothers. Drama. Starring Natalie Portman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Tobey Maguire. Directed by Jim Sheridan. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)A man goes to war and comes back a spectral presence in his home, thin, scarred and haunted, an empty shell who left everything in Afghanistan except his anger. The power of war to transform people, the subject of Jim Sheridan's Brothers, is brought home in the performance of Tobey Maguire, a normally boyish actor who leaves no doubt that this Marine has seen and done things that are possessing his entire being.Brothers touches on the effects of war and also on the culture of a specific type of family. The father, played by Sam Shepard, is a former soldier, a very hard, limited man and a nasty drunk. His sons grew up to play the roles this mean, stupid man assigned to them, Sam (Maguire) as the family hero and Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) as the black sheep. The film suggests that only when Sam is no longer a daily presence in Tommy's life - as the opposite number that gives him definition as the bad son - can the younger brother come into his own as a man. Directed by Sheridan, written by David Benioff (25th Hour) and based on a Danish film by Susanne Bier (After the Wedding), Brothers has the careful observation, measured pace and lived-in feeling of a good European film. Gyllenhaal and Maguire have the flashy roles in Brothers, and they don't shrink from them. But it may very well be Natalie Portman, as a military wife and the mother of Sam's two daughters, that you'll find yourself thinking about the next day.In a role without any flamboyant touches, playing what is essentially just a decent, intelligent woman, Portman lends the film dignity, understanding and true radiance. Portman has gotten so beautiful in the past few years that Benioff has to fit it into the script - he has to account for her appearance by having others comment on it, in the same way you'd have to account for a character with two heads. But this is about more than being really pretty and has to do with something specific to movies, a willingness to feel and be seen by the camera.-- Advisory: This film contains strong language and scenes of disturbing violence.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Charlie St. Cloud. Drama. Starring Zac Efron, Amanda Crew and Charlie Tahan. Directed by Burr Steers. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Movies, which are all about the visuals, have a time-honored way of representing virtue - by casting someone beautiful. Beauty is synonymous with goodness onscreen, but the best thing of all is to be beautiful in an interesting way, to have a mind at work and a certain self-possession, to suggest a variety of moods and passions ... which leads us to Zac Efron in Charlie St. Cloud.  Efron is a very young guy - he's only 22 and probably shot this film when he was 21 - but something in the sculpted geometry of his face and in the old-soul look in his eyes makes him more than a pretty kid. Put that face in close-up and Efron reads as a moral idea, one that has something to do with youthful striving and sensitivity, with meaning well and working hard. Efron gets that much credit just standing there, and then, lo and behold, he can act.  Charlie St. Cloud is a delicate film - not flimsy, but fragile - that holds together on the strength of Efron's physical presence and performance. It tells a story about love and loss and the beatings that life and time inflict on poor, suffering humanity. Last year's 17 Again, which Efron made for the same director, Burr Steers, was like a workout for this film: It dealt with similar issues and concerns, but operated with the safety hatchof comedy.  Charlie St. Cloud has no safety hatch. It just offers the real stuff - heartbreak, exultation, metaphysical mystery - under no cover of self-protective cynicism. It dares to be corny, but isn't. It dares to cross the frontier from painful to so-painful-it's funny, but it never does. All this has a lot to do with Steers' command of tone and of the good taste of the screenplay, based on a novel by Ben Sherwood. But none of this would matter without an actor at the center who, simply in his screen essence, embodies the right qualities of humanity, gravity and aspiration. The film begins the way some movies end, with the climax of an exciting boat race. Charlie, though from a working-class background, is a natural aristocrat, with a gift for boating and a breezy, winning manner. The movie takes pains to establish his relationship with his 11-year-old brother (Charlie Tahan), and in the movie's first minutes, we tend to see Charlie through the younger brother's eyes, as infinitely capable, glamorous and glory bound.  The reversal of fortune comes with brutal suddenness. Every other review, I'm sure, will tell you what that reversal is - don't read them. Suffice it to say that it's the kind of blow that would challenge anyone's emotional capacity to recover. Fifteen minutes into the film, Charlie has lost his ambition, and his life has taken a mystical turn.  Amanda Crew plays a young woman from the same town, who has held onto her boating dreams and is planning a solo run around the world. But if you're expecting the usual thing - the girlfriend who brings our hero back to life - this movie has more integrity and sophistication than that. In Crews, it also finds an ideal co-star for Efron, one who is as strikingly intelligent as he is strikingly pretty. By becoming the object of Charlie's interest, she confirms our faith in Charlie's seriousness and probity. -- Advisory: Sexual situations.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Chloe. Drama. Starring Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried and Liam Neeson. Directed by Atom Egoyan. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The success of Chloe is largely due to the contribution of screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson. She takes a ponderous, overly serious, underplotted French film - Nathalie, by the otherwise terrific French director Anne Fontaine - and turns it into something profound and satisfying. Wilson brings out elements in the original film that were not subtle, but subterranean, latent and completely unexplored. She makes sense of motivations and of the characters' personalities and relationships. The result is a remake that's an improvement over the original, and an English-speaking women's film that, for once, beats the French at the genre they do best. As written by Wilson and directed by Atom Egoyan, Chloe becomes a rueful examination of middle-aged insecurity and longing. It's the story of an intelligent professional woman (Julianne Moore) who feels herself circling the drain as she approaches 50, alienated from her snotty teenage son and emotionally abandoned by her preoccupied husband (Liam Neeson). When confronted with persuasive evidence of her husband's infidelity, she hires a call girl, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), to tempt him into an affair. Her hope is that the husband will resist Chloe's advances and prove himself trustworthy, but instead Chloe starts coming back with increasingly lurid stories of the husband's behavior. And though the wife doesn't want to hear it, she can't close her ears to it, either, and so she keeps meeting Chloe, and keeps paying her, and keeps raising the stakes. This is where Egoyan and the actors do their work. They take the reliable emotional road map that is Wilson's script, and they detail it with a wealth of complicated psychological detail. Moore shows us a woman standing on the outside of her own life, getting older, barely recognizing the middle-aged self in the mirror, and surrounded, on all sides, by sexual transgression: a husband she can't trust, a son who's sneaking girls into the house at night. She is in desperate need of closeness, and the movie suggests that these debriefings of Chloe become a twisted form of intimacy.Americans - that is, North Americans, including the Canadian Egoyan - often think of sex in terms of morality. The French don't. They couldn't care less about sexual morality or immorality, but they do tend to think of sex in grand existential terms. But here's the funny thing: For this tawdry tale, the American approach just makes a lot more sense. Or at least it does for 95 percent of the film's running time. Unfortunately, after liberating this premise from some weaknesses endemic among lesser European films - a bland story, no third act, a certain maudlin pomposity in place of genuine seriousness - Chloe falls prey, near the finish, to weaknesses that plague American movies. We'll leave it at that, except to say that, had this movie ended five minutes earlier, it would probably be counted among the best films of 2010.Even then, this is an unusually strong actress vehicle, with Moore at her best and with Amanda Seyfried coming into her own, in a performance that gets yet richer upon reflection. Finally, not that this has anything to do with the movie's quality, but you may have heard, this is the film that Neeson was making when his wife, Natasha Richardson, died as a result of a tragic skiing accident. None of that grief is evident in the film. What is evident is why Neeson considered Chloe worth completing.-- Advisory: This film contains strong language, simulated sex and drug use.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Coco Before Chanel. Drama. Starring Audrey Tautou, Benoit Poelvoorde, Alessandro Nivola and Marie Gillain. Directed by Anne Fontaine. In French with English subtitles. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Though Amelie established her in America as a whimsical zany, Audrey Tautou's essence as an actress has always had much more to do with melancholy, a kind of systemic sadness born of an innate capacity for unvarnished observation. Tautou's dark eyes always seem to see the truth of things, and in Coco Before Chanel, she finds her ideal role, playing a woman whose direct gaze took in and understood everything - from the desperation of her own situation to the ridiculousness of women's styles at the turn of the 20th century. Gabrielle Coco Chanel is already a tough cookie when we meet her, working as a singing waitress in a cabaret (the song Coco is her specialty) and living in an orphanage with her sister Adrienne (Marie Gillain). Though adversity seems to have taught the sister to trust people and wish for the best, Coco has derived another lesson entirely - that she's on her own and that weakness is death. Coco Chanel is not the most lovable of heroines, but it's a strength of the film that director Anne Fontaine allows Tautou to make Coco as cold and ungiving as she does. As Adrienne, Marie Gillain provides the movie warmth, though it's understood that Adrienne is a romantic dreamer and that Coco knows the score. The early 20th century is a maze of traps for women, especially for those born poor: prostitution, destitution, factory labor. Coco is hard because any sentimentality could lead to disaster. Through relentless self-assertion, Coco becomes the occasional lover and houseguest of Etienne, a rich playboy, played by Belgian actor Benoit Poelvoorde as a man enslaved by decadence. It's a beautiful portrait of weakness and superficiality, combined with a residual decency and painful self-knowledge. It's perhaps the best performance in the film. Alessandro Nivola plays the other man in Coco's life, Boy Capel, a blithe English polo player who encourages Coco's design ambitions. Coco Before Chanel is essentially the portrait of an artist, and the film takes care to show the development of Chanel's design vision. Long before she has started designing women's apparel, she is shown walking among society women, marveling at the multiple layers of clothing and the constraining corsets that women accepted as their lot in life. The movie suggests that it's Coco's position on the outside of society that allowed her to see the situation with fresh eyes, and that what she devised - modern, simplified - was an essential part of women's emancipation in the 20th century.  Fontaine and Tautou don't pretend that emancipation is easy. Coco Before Chanel is inevitably a tale of triumph, but there are miles on Coco's spirit by the time she comes into her destiny. Look for Tautou in the remarkable scene in which Coco watches her models wearing her designs. The focus is intense, that of someone who has concentrated everything she has and everything she is into this one act of self-creation. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky. Drama. Starring Anna Mouglalis, Mads Mikkelsen and Elena Morozova. Directed by Jan Kounen. (R. 120 minutes. In French and Russian with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.)For at least a half hour, Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky is a brilliant and exciting film and seems almost sure to be one of the best of 2010. Then it becomes simply good. Then it becomes merely interesting. And then, about 15 minutes before the finish, it becomes dull and interminable.Now if this had happened in reverse - if it went from dull to amazing - we'd probably call this film a great success. But movies, like criminals and traitors, tend to be judged for how they end up, not for the good they do before they lose their way. Yet this needn't be an ironclad rule, especially with a film like this, whose first scenes are not just good or promising but dazzling. In them, director Jan Kounen meticulously reconstructs one of the most important artistic events of the 20th century, the debut of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring.The place: Paris. The date: May 29, 1913. Coco Chanel gets up from the bed of her lover, Boy Capel, to go to the ballet. For those who saw Coco Before Chanel, this is not the grumpy but cuddly Coco of Audrey Tautou. This is the sleek, inscrutable Coco of Anna Mouglalis, and Mouglalis is simply more believable in the role: Angular, shrewd and unsentimental, Mouglalis can wear anything and look like an aristocrat. She also seems smarter than everybody and slightly terrifying, which is right for the role.On this night, Coco has an opening-night ticket to see the new Stravinsky work, as choreographed by Nijinsky and performed by the Ballets Russes. Lucky her, lucky us: Because she has a ticket, we have one, too, and if you've ever wished you could go back and see that seminal, world-shaking night, this movie is as close to a time machine as you could ever hope for. Sometimes knowing what's going to happen makes things more dramatic, not less (as anyone who has ever watched the Zapruder film can tell you). By the end of the show, the staid, upper-class audience will have erupted. People will be hissing and shouting at the stage. Audience members will be fighting in the aisles. The din will be so loud that the dancers won't be able to hear the music. But Coco Chanel, sitting in the audience, will understand exactly what she's seeing and welcome it.The sequence is more than just dramatic - it's moving. You are witnessing an audience's reaction to the coming of the 20th century. You are seeing an angry and hysterical denial of truth. And could you blame them for wanting to deny it? From 1815 to 1913, Europe had lived in relative peace and stability. But The Rite of Spring foretold chaos, violence, a mechanistic nightmare, just as Nijinsky's strange, propulsive choreography turned bodies into jerking machines. This was the future, and only an alert, prescient and uncompromising sensibility could see it - and recognize any beauty in that truth.The rest of Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky deals with the love affair, of sorts, between these two inventors of the modern. The affair comes about slowly and is complicated - and made more interesting - by the fact that Stravinsky has a perfectly nice and rather essential wife (Elena Morozova), who understands his work inside out and seems to know every move he makes before he makes it. I had a hard time seeing the impish old Stravinsky that I know from archival films in the stone-faced Stravinsky of Mads Mikkelsen, but maybe Igor didn't loosen up until he got older.The essential problem with the latter part of the film is that, as presented here, Coco and Igor are just too cool to say anything. Minutes at a time go by without any dialogue, and the film begins to feel like an attempt at a silent movie - that is, music and pictures, without dialogue - that fails. Still, given all that went before, I found this easy to forgive, but if you get bored, just leave. It doesn't recover. -- Advisory: Lots of nudity and simulated sex.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Crazy Heart. Drama. Starring Jeff Bridges, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell. Directed by Scott Cooper. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Perhaps the idea of watching Jeff Bridges as a drunken, broken-down, down-on-his luck country music singer in Crazy Heart doesn't automatically sound appealing. But think this: The Wrestler. With good songs. Bridges' command of this character and this movie are apparent from the first moments, when he pulls up at the bowling alley where he'll be playing that night. He gets out of the car with his pants unbuckled, because that's how a fellow would drive who's got a big gut and 300 miles between gigs. When he talks, there's whiskey in the voice and just the faintest hint of breathlessness, like someone in the early stages of emphysema. Then he goes up to the bowling alley's bar and tries to charm the barmaid into giving him a free drink, but it's the thin charm of a drowning man.Scott Cooper, who wrote and directed Crazy Heart, adopts a smart strategy in introducing the central character. First he shows us everything that's wrong with Bad Blake (Bridges), and only then does he show him perform - and we get to see that this falling-down mess is actually talented. The songs are catchy, and the voice is full of character and lived-in authenticity. This is Bridges doing his own singing, of original songs by T Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton, and it's nothing like some conscientious actor doing decent karaoke. As a singer, as a stage presence and as a country music stylist, Bridges has it all. So what happened to Bad Blake? Is this the fate of a talented recording artist, popular today and forgotten the next? Is the pressure of the musician's life acting on a sensitive spirit, or just a morally lazy man who went off the tracks long ago? The answer is a combination of all those things and one or two more. Crazy Heart gives us an aging musician's life on the road, which consists of lots of drinking, smoking and one-night stands - with groupies who are as weathered as he is. Along the way, there are crystalline moments when the music is just right. Maggie Gyllenhaal turns up as a journalist who interviews Blake. Her questions are embarrassingly vague and show no preparation, though this is just a professional quibble on my part. Bad journalism aside, Gyllenhaal's naturally skeptical, amused and watchful quality is just right for a role in which she finds herself relentlessly drawn to a man she knows is bad news. But this show belongs to Bridges, who starts off as a magnificent train wreck and then takes a journey with the character. He understands Bad Blake so completely and is so confident and competent in his capacity as a singer that the acting doesn't stop at the stage door. There are subtle differences in his singing when Blake is drunk or sober, for example, and not in the usual ways. When he's drunk, he doesn't slur his words - he's just emotionally disconnected. And when he's sober, he's all there. Likewise, there's a difference in the way Blake sings his new songs and his old songs. He's more present for the new material. Bridges has been this good in a handful of other roles, but he's never been better.And Colin Farrell has never been worse, although in Crazy Heart Farrell is awful in a benign way that doesn't hurt anybody. As country music's reigning star, Farrell looks super-embarrassed every time he has to sing, and in the offstage scenes, Farrell keeps his head down and won't make eye contact with the other actors. Farrell seems as if he just wants to get out of the movie without anybody, including critics, noticing him. He even chose to keep his name out of the credits. He could run, but he can't hide. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, strong language and substance abuse.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Creation. Drama. Starring Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly and Martha West. Directed by Jon Amiel. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)It's difficult to make drama out of a life spent in solitary study, and Creation, which deals with the life of Charles Darwin, shows the strain of that effort.Through flashbacks, the movie gives us three distinct periods in Darwin's life, which we keep track of by checking on Darwin's degree of hair loss. In the earliest scenes, when he's happy, he has a full head of hair. In the middle scenes, when his favorite daughter, Annie, falls ill, his hairline is receding. And in the later scenes, in which he is a physical and mental wreck - suffering from tremors, stomach disorders and hallucinations - he has the mid-19th century equivalent of a comb-over.The constant use of flashbacks becomes the filmmakers' arbitrary way of imposing a sense of narrative where there isn't much of a real one. The death of his daughter - a death we know about from the movie's first minutes - was the worst thing that ever happened to Darwin, and that, alas, makes it the story's greatest source for potential drama. Whenever the spectacle of Darwin boiling pigeons or struggling to write On the Origin of Species becomes monotonous, the movie flashes back to Annie (Martha West), who is precocious and adorable, and we're forced to dread what's coming.Along the way, the movie sets up an argument between the religious and scientific views of the world ... and then doesn't follow through. Darwin's supporters in the scientific community tell him that his research has killed God, which they see as a good thing. As a counterbalance, the film offers the local preacher, an appealing man as played by Jeremy Northam, but one who isn't given a single line that isn't a cliche (The Lord works in mysterious ways). If Creation wanted to present a statement about the value of science over religion - or of the social benefits of atheism - it needed to make and refute the other side of the argument. This is just too easy. Moreover, in the movie's haste to put forward an either/or proposition, it doesn't once address an obvious fact, that Darwin's theory of evolution does not preclude the possibility of religious faith, except for atheists or fundamentalists. The filmmakers' effort to keep the science/religion argument easy and pure renders it stacked and simple.  These are big faults, but the movie's virtues overcome them in the end. Paul Bettany, though he gives us a Darwin so lacking in energy it's hard to imagine him accomplishing anything, conveys effectively the essential gentleness and decency of the man. Darwin's wife, a religious woman who disapproved of her husband's theories, is played by Jennifer Connelly, Bettany's real-life wife, in the kind of casting that doesn't always work, but it does here. We believe in the Darwins' history together, their familiarity and affection. Connelly's English accent is also as good as Renée Zellweger's and Gwyneth Paltrow's. She doesn't get just the sounds right, but also the music and the attitude.  The film's attempt to depict challenging and thoughtful material is appreciated, even if the results are mixed. It helps that most of Creation is about the relationships - Darwin's with his wife and with his daughter. Even if we resist it, even if we don't want to be dragged in, the story of Annie becomes quite moving, almost unbearable. Here and there, director Jon Amiel jazzes things up with a handful of dream and hallucinatory sequences, which, if they were just a little more joyful and out of control, might seem like something out a Ken Russell movie. Any attempt to do Ken Russell is OK with me.  By the way, Amiel will appear at the Landmark Embarcadero to answer questions and introduce his film at Saturday evening screenings and at the Sunday matinee.  -- Advisory: Adult situations.Great-great-grandson talks about Darwin.

"Watch the trailer for the movie Eat Pray Love. Comedy-Drama. Starring Julia Roberts, Billy Crudup and Javier Bardem. Directed by Ryan Murphy. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Julia Roberts spends a lot of time meditating in Eat Pray Love, and at a certain point the movie replicates the effects of meditation within the audience. About two-thirds into the film - probably during one of the hundred or so times someone tells our heroine that she should open up to love - my mind shut off. When it switched back on a minute later, I didn't know the day or time, or where I was or what movie was onscreen. Eat Pray Love had induced a state of pure, undifferentiated being. This experience, unique in a lifetime of moviegoing, says something about the numbing quality of Eat Pray Love at its worst. It is 140 minutes long and repetitious beyond belief. Yet for all its weaknesses - unconscious contradictions, travelogue simplicity and mix-and-match spirituality - Eat Pray Love is, like its central character, on a genuine quest. It's about something important, the search for meaning and happiness, about finding one's inner life amid the clutter and confusion of modern existence.Based on the memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert, it's the story of a successful writer (Roberts) who, like Dante, finds herself in her mid-thirties feeling lost and without direction. She ends her marriage to her sweet but hapless husband (Billy Crudup) and, after the obligatory affair with a sensitive young hunk (James Franco, of course), she decides to renew herself through travel. First she'll go to Italy and enjoy good food. Then to India, to pray in an ashram. And then to Bali, to find love.There's an irony here that the movie can't acknowledge without imploding the whole enterprise. Much of the message of Eat Pray Love is that people - success-driven Americans, in particular - need to kick back, enjoy themselves and let life in, just let things happen. But Gilbert's spiritual journey may be the most programmatic in history, with realizations and discoveries planned in advance, from a desk in New York City. Thinly veiled in Eastern robes, Eat Pray Love is the ultimate American success story, in which every warm human contact becomes grist for commerce. That we can push these dark thoughts aside is largely due to Julia Roberts, who has never seemed so relaxed and at home with herself. She doesn't push, has no underlying sense of aggrievement. She is, instead, a nice travel partner, easy to take over a long, long trip, and we believe, at all times, that she's searching for happiness and not merely filling out a pre-packaged best-seller. Javier Bardem as Felipe and Julia Roberts as Elizabeth Gilbert in Columbia Pictures' EAT, PRAY, LOVE.Javier Bardem as Felipe and Julia Roberts as Elizabeth Gilbert in Columbia Pictures' EAT, PRAY, LOVE.The movie benefits also from Ryan Murphy's sensitive and tasteful direction, which finds subtle ways to illuminate and amplify Gilbert's thoughts and emotions, which are central to the story. Her dark night of the soul, early in the film, in which she decides to leave her husband, is handled simply: It takes place in the middle of the night, with a languor and a quietness that distills a sense of aloneness and mental oppression. When the film switches to Rome, Murphy uses the natural soundscape, so that we can hear the unique sounds of that city. At times, Eat Pray Love feels like Travel 101. When the Italians tell Liz, for example, about the Italian art of La dolce far niente - the sweetness of doing nothing - that's something you can hear five minutes into any Rick Steves or Samantha Brown travel video. Still, the movie conveys a genuine feel for the mood and the sights of the city, and in the end, it does for Rome what Frances Mayes did for Tuscany. Eat Pray Love has three challenges it never completely overcomes. The first is that leaving Rome is never a good idea. The second is that much of the movie is about the spirit, but you can't make drama out of someone meditating. The third is that, for all its length and ambition, the film's spiritual insight is superficial. Liz's journey toward self-acceptance arguably borders on solipsism. Perhaps not accepting herself might have been a more enlightened first step. For all these reasons, the India section sags woefully. But then, things pick up in Bali, with the arrival of Javier Bardem, who's just more manly and elemental than Franco and Crudup, definitely more suited to Roberts, who looks like she could eat those other guys alive. Pray is rough going, ideal for a bathroom break or a soul-renewing trance. But Eat and Love are cinema friendly. -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Edge of Darkness. Drama. Starring Mel Gibson, Bojana Novakovic and Danny Huston. Directed by Martin Campbell. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)In the six years since his last big-screen role, Mel Gibson has taken on the look of an aging parent. He plays a Boston police detective with a grown-up daughter, and seeing him with her - that is, seeing Gibson playing opposite the young actress who plays his daughter - is like seeing an older guy who accepts that his life energy is ebbing and who takes comfort that his vitality lives undiminished in his child. Gibson has only one scene with the daughter (Bojana Novakovic) in Edge of Darkness, and he plays it with the gentle self-consciousness of someone not old but getting old, who senses that the power balance between parent and offspring has imperceptibly shifted in favor of the younger generation. This is touching to see, and so when the daughter is killed - this happens within five minutes of the opening credits - it lands with an awful impact. Director Martin Campbell films Gibson staring into space in the aftermath looking small and weakened, as if he's not only lost his reason for living but also half his physical strength. Welcome to the Gibson Zone. For better and sometimes worse, this actor is about anguish - to be specific, spiritual anguish as expressed through physical suffering. Gibson brings this tangible, deep-lived-in pain to Edge of Darkness, a pain that goes way beyond the usual this-time-it's-personal nonsense that we find in most crime movies. As Gibson plays it, the death of the daughter is not a misfortune, not merely a sad thing that happened, but a cataclysm. It's a rearranging of the planets and a revelation of dimensions of human suffering that no one knew existed. Take that quality - Gibson's ability to feel it and make you feel it - and combine it with the storytelling skill of Campbell, who directed the best James Bond film of a generation, Casino Royale, and you have the recipe for a crime drama that's exciting in the moment and that lingers in the mind. The film is based on a six-part BBC drama, which Campbell directed in 1985. In adapting six episodes into less than two hours, screenwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have crafted a tightly plotted story, loaded (but not overwhelmed) with incident. The grieving detective (Gibson) starts tugging on a loose thread and finds himself starting to unravel fathomless conspiracies involving politicians, paid assassins and corporate villains. It's an arresting clash of forces: The bad guys have everything, but they have everything to lose; and the lone hero has no power, except the power that comes with having no limits. He's lost everything already.Gibson, who was a convincing Southerner in We Were Soldiers, becomes an honest East Coast working man in Edge of Darkness, assuming the sounds of a blue-collar Boston accent and all the things that go with it, too - the facial expressions, the social diffidence, the way of looking at life. The detective doesn't start out a superhero, and he doesn't morph into one as the movie progresses. Gibson plays him at all times as a regular guy, out of his depth, trying to get from one minute to the next as he encounters people so depraved, he can hardly believe it.Against Gibson's aura of uncomplicated decency his co-stars' villainy gets to stand out in sharp relief. As a nuclear executive, Danny Huston seems mentally convoluted and baroque, and Dennis O'Hare's government bureaucrat is like some fretting fiend, unwilling to slow down for one second to consider obscure matters such as truth or common decency. Damian Young plays a Massachusetts senator as the worst kind of stuffed shirt: corrupt, complacent and oozing politeness.These villains are specific, of course, but they're also archetypes for the things people fear - unseen powers running our lives, running our world, threatening to take what's most precious from us. I don't see Edge of Darkness as a great movie, or a particularly exalted one, but I do see it as one made by people who know where the buttons are - and who know how to press them.

"Watch the trailer for the movie Everybody's Fine. Drama. Starring Robert De Niro, Sam Rockwell, Kate Beckinsale and Drew Barrymore. Directed by Kirk Jones. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Let the sentiment reveal itself. Don't veer into sentimentality. Don't push. Just trust the story. That's the whole trick with a movie like Everybody's Fine. Nineteen years ago, the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) made the original version of this story, and he gave into every bad temptation - faux Fellini dream sequences and enough schmaltz to cover the Mediterranean coast. Now comes this American version, which turns out to be the exception, an American remake that's better than the European original.In retrospect, Tornatore was probably just too young back then (in his early 30s) not to make something romantic out of old age. Writer-director Kirk Jones, who is a decade older, takes Tornatore's central character, a delusional old civil servant (a kind of feeble-minded version of De Sica's Umberto D.), and transforms him into a blue-collar American guy who bought into the American dream. Played by Robert De Niro, Frank has a major investment in his children's success. His self-conception is riding on it.  The setup is simple. Dad, a recent widower, finds out that none of his four grown children will be flying out for a planned holiday get-together. So he decides to go to them, to travel to the various cities where they live and surprise each one. But wherever he goes, he finds a strained welcome and hints that their lives might be quite different from what they've told him. To enjoy Everybody's Fine, you have to accept that it's possible, in a modern American family, for adult children to misrepresent their careers or hide from their father major life changes such as divorce and childbirth. Accept that, and Everybody's Fine becomes a satisfying family story that accomplishes something unlikely but essential. It establishes convincing family dynamics that allow audiences to believe that Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore are siblings and that De Niro is their father.  I particularly enjoyed Rockwell, who slips easily into a roughneck mold, playing a workaday musician, and Barrymore, who has within her a natural capacity to be a very satisfying daughter. Clearly, the director worked with his actors in establishing a family history and a pattern of relationships. We're never told the backstory, but it's suggested in the texture of the interaction. One child (Barrymore) was Daddy's favorite. Another steered clear. Another made points by excelling in school. Another could do nothing right. Finally, De Niro gets to make a good movie. -- Advisory: The movie contains one brief, shining outburst of profanity.To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies, listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Green Zone. Drama. Starring Matt Damon, Brendan Gleeson, Greg Kinnear and Amy Ryan. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Director Paul Greengrass is working his way through recent American history, but it's giving him a bad case of the shakes. His latest, Green Zone, which dramatizes how bureaucratic arrogance and stupidity ended up pouring gasoline on the Iraq insurgency, is watchable in spite of Greengrass as much as because of him. The story is good enough to make viewers want to ignore the photography. He begins by showing us the start of the war, the shock and awe air offensive, as experienced from the ground. Just imagine the license such a scene might give to a director who wants to shake the camera. This is followed by an assault by American troops, under sniper fire, at a building thought to hold weapons of mass destruction. Of course, there's nothing there, and from the bird droppings, it's clear there hasn't been anything there for a decade. It's a tribute to Matt Damon's special quality as an actor - not his star wattage, but his ability to project a certain simple human decency - that we care about him even when we only see the side of his head, the back of his head and the stray glimpse of his head bobbing into and out of the frame. In the first 10 minutes of Green Zone, it becomes exhausting (for some it will be dizzying) trying to penetrate the loony camera work just to locate the actors and the story.  But then the story kicks in, and perhaps Greengrass takes a Valium - not an extra-strength one, 5 milligrams at most - and it suddenly becomes possible to watch Green Zone without feeling that one is wrestling with it.  As a chief warrant officer leading men into lethal street battles over worthless, empty sights, Damon is smart enough to know that the bad intelligence can't be random. The intelligence has been cooked. His effort to find out what's behind the mess gives him a ringside seat to the turf battles between savvy Middle East experts and administration-appointed dilettantes, who'd be challenged running a bowling alley, much less a country. The film is based on Rajiv Chandrasekaran's nonfiction book, Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone. From this, screenwriter Brian Helgeland (Mystic River) fashions a fictional story, but with characters based on either real people or recognizable types: The duped journalist (Amy Ryan). The crony (Greg Kinnear) brought in to run the show. And the career intelligence officer (Brendan Gleeson) who knows that these ignoramuses and lightweights are about to create a disaster.Kinnear is best known for playing engaging, likable characters, but there's something especially satisfying about seeing him as a villain here, if only because the kind of villain he plays is so common in the world, and yet so underrepresented in art. He's the man on a small scale, who will do evil and yet never admit it to himself, and create catastrophe and never feel responsible. He's the man whose entire life and manner are based on a fundamental confusion between geniality and morality. Even if you catch a guy like this and bring him up on war crimes, he'd only be confused. He'd say, Wait! I'm a nice guy! Fortunately for Kinnear, if he really were that man he couldn't play him so well.  The challenge facing the filmmakers with Green Zone is that the audience knows how the real history played out: The cronies triumphed and within months plunged the country into chaos. Still, within those limits, Greengrass and Helgeland squeeze out a convincing narrative, one that's gripping and suspenseful and keeps us worrying about Damon - and thinking about all the other soldiers, shafted by bureaucrats. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and violence.

"Watch the trailer for the movie Greenberg. Comedy-drama. Starring Ben Stiller and Greta Gerwig. Directed by Noah Baumbach. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Ben Stiller's haircut in Greenberg gives you his character. It's a little too long, but not long enough to be a style statement. It's bushy and curling in the wrong places, like something that might look good only on a 20-year-old. But it's carefully groomed, too, suggesting a guy who has definite (but incorrect) ideas about himself. The haircut announces to the world that he's wedded to an outdated self-image from 20 years ago, that he doesn't have much money (or else he'd go to a stylist) and that he doesn't have a girlfriend. Details like these have allowed writer-director Noah Baumbach to keep making this kind of movie for the past 15 years. Film students start their careers wanting to make such movies - small, completely personal films about people like the folks they know; films that are short on plot and that, by the end, go nowhere, that end on an ellipsis. ... Then they realize that nobody wants to see these movies and that, in most cases, nobody should want to see them. The Baumbach difference is that although he focuses on characters we might find in life, they happen to be exceptionally distinct characters. Moreover, as he does in Greenberg, Baumbach notices things about them that we might not see. And he brings out those character traits by carefully putting people into conflict - not huge conflict, tiny conflict, but just enough so that the feeling is often tense, scene after scene. Baumbach may paint miniatures, but his films are anything but quaint. They're as unsettling as meeting a harmless but difficult stranger.  Like Nicole Kidman in Margot at the Wedding and Jeff Daniels in The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg places at its center an intelligent but colossally self-deluded lead character. Newly released from a mental hospital after a breakdown, Greenberg (Ben Stiller) is house-sitting for his highly successful brother, who is off on a business vacation. If the movie has a story - and there really isn't much of one - it involves the contact that develops (you couldn't really call it a romance or a friendship) between Greenberg and his brother's 25-year-old assistant (Greta Gerwig), who runs the household.  It is Gerwig's profile that appears under the opening credits, and as much as Stiller, she's an object of Baumbach's contemplation - a gentle, tactful, emotionally open young woman, whose complete lack of sexual barriers seems less a personal characteristic than a generational trait. In another era, such a woman would have been played by Sandy Dennis or Diane Keaton or Rosanna Arquette and would have been diagnosed as having low self-esteem. But that's not the case here. At one point, Greenberg attempts to buck up her spirits, telling her You're of value, and she looks at him as if he's nuts. Of course she's of value - she knows it, and we already know she knows it.  Where other filmmakers find types, Baumbach discovers characters. He finds the radiance in this average young woman. In a rocker who never made it (Rhys Ifans), he finds the dignity of a thoughtful man whose life disappointment has been incorporated within the framework of a healthy self-image. And in Greenberg - who would have been a lovable nut in every other comedy - he finds the ugly selfishness of neurosis. Greenberg might be beyond help, and then again he might not. It's up to Baumbach to decide, and maybe he does, but maybe he doesn't. I wish he'd decide more decisively, but Baumbach makes the movies he wants to make. Jennifer Jason Leigh (Baumbach's wife) appears in two scenes, as an ex-girlfriend of Greenberg, and she's quietly brilliant, as always. It's just a nice reminder of an actress who's the late Baby Boomer version of Meryl Streep, whose talent deserves more than scenes but entire movies built around her.  -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations, nudity and strong language.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Harry Brown. Drama. Starring Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer. Directed by Daniel Barber. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If you go to London, you end up meeting lots of people like Michael Caine in Harry Brown, who are kind, courtly and very working class. More than a specific character, Caine gives us a type of person in this movie, a gentle, salt of the earth cockney fellow that we think of as quintessentially English. And then, in an irresistible stroke, the movie puts him up against the embodiment of everything quintessentially modern and awful - a gang of violent thugs terrorizing a housing project.  The shorthand on Harry Brown is that it's Michael Caine as a 77-year-old vigilante, and in a way that would have been enough - at worst, Caine would have made it watchable. Instead Harry Brown has more to say, about aging, about old-school courtesy in collision with blind stupid violence, and about how sometimes pensioners on a fixed income get stuck in neighborhoods that turn dangerous. To an extent, the movie is even about Caine himself and what he's come to mean to audiences over the years.  There's an early scene in which Caine, as Harry, a recent widower, reminisces about how he met his wife. It was back in the days when he was in the Royal Marines, he says: He spotted a girl, cut in on the dance floor, and they danced together the rest of the night. It's just a little story, related in a simple, touching way, but its effectiveness is enhanced by our ability to picture it. We can see the incident in our minds because we know what Michael Caine looked like as a young man. And in that moment, it's all there, a poignant awareness of time passing that works inside the film and outside the film, as well, and makes us see Caine as Harry and Harry as Caine. Harry's wife has just died, and though the movie never has anyone mention it, his one daughter has been dead for many years. (You can pick this up only by reading a tombstone in the background.) So he is a man who has known sadness and doesn't really want anything more than to go to the pub, play chess with his best friend and wait, in sober equanimity, for the arrival of the Grim Reaper. But then some street punks kill his friend, and Harry - well, at first he's very sad. Then he gets really, really mad. Turns out, this old man who can't run and is none too steady on his feet has one huge advantage over the local gangsters, and it isn't that he used to be a Marine. It's that he doesn't care what happens to him. He's ready to go at any time. This quality is not, strictly speaking, to be found in the script but rather is something that Caine brings. And it adds a special quality to this movie's one great scene, in which Harry goes into the lair of some crazy drug dealers in order to buy a gun. They look like minor demons in a Hieronymus Bosch painting, cadaverous, drug-ridden and full of rage - it's scary just to look at them. But because Harry's not afraid of death, he's not focused on himself. He's able to clock everything going on around him. Writer Gary Young and director Daniel Barber lavish time on the villains so that the audience can really come to loathe, revile and despise them. They also introduce a sympathetic character in the form of Emily Mortimer, as a remarkably sensitive police detective. They provide a reliable frame for Caine, who uses a good script and a stock action premise to create something unexpectedly moving, one of his most heartfelt portraits in recent years.  -- Advisory: Drug use, nudity, strong language and graphic violence.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Invictus. Drama. Starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (PG-13. 134 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Morgan Freeman has become such a notable and noble presence in American film that it would seem almost as appropriate for Nelson Mandela to be playing Freeman in Invictus, instead of the reverse. Freeman's signature presence comes rich with associations, but it comes with disadvantages, too. For example, when this actor, who has one of the most recognizable speaking styles in movies, first starts talking with a South African accent, the effect is inescapably comical.Equally disconcerting is the first sight of Freeman, who usually can manage little more than a wistful smile, suddenly beaming in that genial Mandela way. Instead of accepting that this is Mandela and he's cheerful, the first thought that flits across the mind is, Wow. Morgan Freeman must be really happy to be playing Mandela.And he should be happy. This latest from Clint Eastwood is, by design, a serious holiday-season movie and an automatic Academy Award contender. It's intelligent and classically made, and some people could easily mistake it for a great film. It is, in a sense, a movie in the Great Film Genre - with a worthy subject, an important director and a major actor swinging for the fences in the kind of real-life role that automatically wins respect. But it falls short of its clear intention (just a little too clear) to be inspirational. This is what Eastwood gets for making a lot of great movies in recent years. When he finally makes just a good one, it's necessary to explain why, and it sounds like a slam. In fact, Invictus contains many fine Eastwood touches, which highlight his skill and his tough-guy Norman Rockwell personality.Here's just one example: During a crucial rugby match, he shows a little black boy lingering by a police car, in which two white cops are listening to the game. Throughout the match, Eastwood cuts to the three of them, each time showing the boy edging closer ... until, finally, all three are listening and celebrating together. Eastwood contains the entire essence of his story in those little wordless tableaus, and in a light and seemingly offhand way.Invictus is a sort of combination biopic/sports movie, which tells the story of Nelson Mandela from his release after 27 years in prison through his first years as South Africa's president. Freeman, who grows into the role, presents Mandela as a master manipulator, one who is genuinely appreciative of other people but nonetheless aware of his own charm. He has the politician's gift of being able to say things without saying them, and he's nicely matched, in their few scenes together, by Matt Damon as a rugby team captain who is modest, open and completely straightforward.Some of the best parts of the film occur in the first hour, in which Mandela, upon assuming the presidency, has to rein in his own partisans who want to exact vengeance on the white population after years of apartheid. These early scenes show the dangers Mandela faced and showcase his political acumen, as well as his humanity and psychological insight. Mandela doesn't want to fracture his country but unite it, and so he seizes on the rugby team - with its millions of white fans - as a vehicle for bringing together all South Africans in a common cause. In his subtle, suggestive way, he lets it be known that South Africa must win the World Cup. This country is hungry for greatness, he says.At its best, Invictus demonstrates the connections between sports and politics, as in the superb scene in which the team goes to a poor black township to teach the kids rugby. But as the film wears on, Invictus takes on the contours of a standard sports movie, making it both predictable - wanna guess the ending? - and reductive: Certainly South Africa had bigger problems than rugby, and Mandela had more on his plate than the World Cup. Eastwood devotes about 20 minutes to the final game. He does it well: For one thing, he doesn't fall back on the crutch of having an announcer tell us what's going on. But by then, Invictus is mostly about the game, and only partly about South Africa and Mandela. It's never less than worthy and entertaining, but the importance of Invictus doesn't broaden as it goes along. It narrows.-- Advisory: Aside from some brief strong language - cover their ears - there's nothing here that kids can't see.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Knight and Day.Action comedy. Starring Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Peter Sarsgaard. Directed by James Mangold. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Knight and Day is a high-functioning entertainment machine, guaranteed to please just about everyone who isn't determined to be grumpy. It places two charismatic stars in an engaging, action-filled story, set in a variety of glamorous locations, about a woman inexorably drawn into the sphere of a rogue government agent - an agent who looks great and can do absolutely anything, because he's played by Tom Cruise.He seems poised to break one of the unwritten laws of cinema, that action movies just don't work once an actor is in his late 40s. Before that age, men are footloose and can do anything on screen, but by 47 or 48, guys begin to look like, Why is Daddy still getting into fights with everybody? But at 47, Cruise looks at most 42 - and that's in close-up, in direct sunlight - and though he appears in one scene eating an ice cream cone, he hasn't been eating many of those in his off hours. This man has been working out like a monster.Give Cruise credit: Nobody works as hard - nobody else would ever work this hard - at being Tom Cruise than Cruise. As a screen energy, Cameron Diaz is as scattered as Cruise is focused, as open as he is covered and as clearly benign as he is shady. When she smiles, you know everything is all right. When he smiles, you have no idea what he's thinking. His charm disarms, but it doesn't reassure - which is all a long-winded way of saying that these two make a very good and complementary pair.The early scenes are a delight, particularly one on an airplane, in which she sees this handsome stranger as a possible romantic connection, while he's aware that he's surrounded by enemies - and that, at any moment, they might make their move. Equally amusing is the ongoing revelation of our hero's abilities, as well as his unfailing politeness in the most harrowing of circumstances. If the movie has a weakness, it's that once you get the gag, you get the gag. The movie establishes a pattern in which every time Roy (Cruise) shows up, all hell breaks loose. And then it keeps repeating the pattern. The concomitant suggestion that, with each encounter, June (Diaz) grows in confidence and competence feels like an arbitrary construction, there to support a sense of narrative movement. Fortunately, the structural sameness is balanced by genuinely witty action sequences that also create a rooting interest. The banter is fairly diverting, too, especially as delivered by actors who are naturally funny. She asks, Are those the bad guys? He answers, No. Worse guys. The locations are straight out of a Rick Steves travel video - Seville, Salzburg - and director James Mangold milks them for all their glamour and allure.  Peter Sarsgaard, looking like he has a bad taste in his mouth but enjoys having a bad taste in his mouth, plays the rival agent on Cruise's tail. He might be the movie's true villain; but then again, it might be Cruise. Hmm. Sarsgaard or Cruise, Sarsgaard or Cruise ... Let's give this one lots of thought.  In the end, Knight and Day isn't really about much of anything besides having a good time or perhaps the meaning of Tom Cruise-ness in the universe. But sometimes movies are interesting for what they say when the filmmakers think they're saying nothing - that's when they reveal what they consider to be self-evident. Very much in keeping with the public mood, Knight and Day tells audiences that no one is to be trusted, especially organized power, i.e. governments, business, crime syndicates.  As for the rest, all you've got are your instincts.-- Advisory: This film contains violence.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Mother and Child. Drama. Starring Annette Bening, Naomi Watts, Kerry Washington and Samuel Jackson. Directed by Rodrigo Garcia. (R. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Rodrigo Garcia knew he was making a good movie, but did he really understand the kind of good movie he was making? That's a presumptuous thing to ask, and yet the question presents itself when you see Mother and Child. For about 100 minutes, the movie is mostly a grounded, realistic study of two specific and thoroughly interesting women, a mother and daughter who were separated at childbirth.  Then, about three-quarters in, the realization breaks that Garcia's concern is not with these particular women at all, but rather in using them to present life as some kind of mystical panorama, full of coincidences and chance occurrences, of joys and tragedies, that we're supposed to witness as though from a distance. With that, something focused becomes general and something urgent becomes fuzzy, and the movie collapses into a fake-poetic muddle.  Yet how do you dislike a movie that gives Naomi Watts her best role since The Painted Veil? She plays a fascinating character - a highly prized young lawyer who drifts from job to job, a woman of enormous confidence and charm but with streaks of coldness and hostility that manifest in erratic sexual behavior and in acts of wanton spitefulness. And then the movie takes her on a journey of transformation. This is a role worthy of the actress, and she gives a performance worthy of the role. The lawyer's cold-bloodedness, we're to understand, has something to do with her lifelong separation from her biological mother. As Mom, Annette Bening presents a bottled-up, difficult personality, who has never gotten over giving up her child and still lives in the shadow of that one event. By now, it's almost unnecessary to say it, but Bening is excellent as always. Garcia should have trusted those two characters (and those two actresses) to bring him home, but instead he introduces Kerry Washington in an unrelated story, as an infertile woman who wants to adopt an infant. Nothing wrong with Washington, but this extra element lengthens the film and takes things into a Babel direction. It tempts Garcia to bring the separate strains together by pursuing a semi-magical realism strategy, which here seems more reflexive than inspired. Viewers will begin to feel had. Still, the goodwill lingers, even though Mother and Child falls down, dies and is beginning to look a little green and stiff about 15 minutes before the finish line. -- Advisory: This film contains very convincing simulated sex, full frontal nudity and strong language.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Pirate Radio.Nostalgic comedy. Starring Tom Sturridge, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy and Talulah Riley. Directed by Richard Curtis. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Seen from a distance, 1966 is a neither-fish-nor-foul era. In 1965, there were no drugs, black-and-white film, and the end of the old. In 1967 , there were LSD, psychedelic colors and the birth of the new. So what was 1966? Yet, people who were there often say that '66 was the best time, the height of that decade's fun. And now Pirate Radio has arrived, evoking 1966 as the life pinnacle for a group of DJs on a boat, broadcasting rock 'n' roll to the United Kingdom. If you want to know years in advance what old-age nostalgia is going to look like for Baby Boomers, look no further than Pirate Radio, in which the sun always shines, the music is great and the sex is available, guilt-free and glorious. This might sound like a sentimental recipe, but Richard Curtis, who wrote and directed, keeps the spirit fresh and anarchic. At one point, the American DJ, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, observes that it's a terrible thing to realize you're living the best days of your life - to know that as you're living them. And with that, we realize what Curtis has achieved in Pirate Radio. For all its irreverence and caustic humor, this movie is about the recipe for happiness - how sometimes it can all come together: friends, community, excitement and faith in the future. Apparently in England at that time, rock 'n' roll could only be played for about an hour a day on the radio. And so pirate stations proliferated, broadcasting from offshore to an audience of 25 million people daily. Sustained by advertising, these stations were serious business, and Pirate Radio depicts one such station, in which a crew and a slate of DJs live together on a big boat, hanging out and playing music all day.Life on the boat is seen through the eyes of young Carl (Tom Sturridge), who is sent by his free-living mother to live there for a few months. Carl is a virgin, which gives the DJs a problem to be solved, in between playing the music of 1966 - and a little from 1969. (Maybe Curtis thought no one would notice the difference.) Yet if Pirate Radio plays a little fast and loose with the music chronology, at least it has the era's look down to a science. Almost every guy on the boat has a haircut something like John Lennon's on the back cover of Revolver (1966).Even more delightful, when Carl is finally fixed up with a girl (Talulah Riley), she is a dead ringer for the actress Anna Karina. This is casting on a sophisticated anthropological and socio-historical level, folks, because if there was one woman on the planet who embodied the style and the fantasy of that particular year, it was Karina. A few years earlier, it might have been Jackie Kennedy. In 1967, it was probably Marianne Faithfull. But in 1966, if you're an 18-year-old guy and a dead ringer for Anna Karina comes walking through the door, you're the happiest (and most nervous) kid on the planet. Curtis, who has written a string of superior movies, including Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, does something quite clever with the story. Essentially, he structures the scenes of life on the boat as a series of disparate incidents. Yet he gives the action the illusion of narrative and a feeling of urgency by cutting to the mainland every few minutes to show how the government is planning to shut the station down.Kenneth Branagh, with his accustomed brio, plays a stuffy English type that he perhaps remembers from his early childhood - a miserably uptight, slicked down suit who hates rock 'n' roll and would be happy to see the pirates dead. He's the villain of the piece, but such is the movie's good nature that we can't dislike him. He is, after all, about to get swept away by history.-- Advisory: This movie contains sexual situations, strong language and drug use.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Salt. Action. Starring Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Directed by Phillip Noyce. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Angelina Jolie can climb up the sides of buildings. She can leap from an overpass onto a truck, dress her own bullet wounds, and yank a guy off a motorcycle as he rides by on the highway. She can even chase an elevator that's going down by jumping from side to side along the shaft like a human fly. The woman is amazing.Now some might say that Jolie can't do these things, that what we're really talking about here is Evelyn Salt, the heroine of the new action thriller, and that Jolie is just an actress. But this is a prosaic distinction hardly worth making. Salt is a dream tailored to the public idea of Jolie as the woman who can do anything. She can do anything onscreen, just as in real life she can stand next to one of the most desired men in the world and have it look like, Oh, yeah. Him.Jolie's superwoman tendencies have resulted mainly in cartoonish, abrasive movies (Wanted, Tomb Raider) worthy of neither her talent nor the intelligence of an audience older than 12. But when exploited properly - as Salt does, keeping her human and vulnerable, so that the character's amazing ability and ingenuity continue to surprise - this thing that Jolie does is, well, very cool. Making us believe in the woman who can do anything, and I mean anything, is Jolie's distinct contribution to today's cinema. This time she really doesn't want to kill anybody. Salt is a CIA agent in search of a desk job, and on the day all hell breaks loose, she's just looking forward to a quiet anniversary dinner at home with her kindly, nerdy husband (August Diehl). Then in walks an old Soviet agent, wanting to defect, with a wild story to tell: Apparently, there are Russian nationals embedded within our intelligence agencies, and at a signal, they will commence their doomsday plan. And one of those agents, he says, is Salt.From there, hold on to your hat. She goes on the run, with the CIA, FBI and the Secret Service after her, and those Russians might want a piece of her, too. Sometimes they're chasing her, and sometimes she's chasing them, but throughout the movie is careful to slow down long enough for viewers to catch their breath and find their place within the story. Director Phillip Noyce strikes a modern mood and makes use of modern technologies, but he's forgotten nothing of what he knew about storytelling in the 1990s, when he made Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. In its small details, Salt can seem ridiculous at times. At one point, she seems to be steering a car by using a Taser on the driver's leg; each spasm makes the car accelerate. The president is presented as a moron, which is a bit behind the curve, and his name - President Lewis - sounds as though it were pulled from a phone book. But it's no match for Vice President Maxwell Oates, a name that sounds funny the first time you hear it and is repeated over and over.The main thing is that Salt holds together. Its narrative strategy is to leave audiences in the dark for much of the action, but each tidbit we're given fits into the broader picture. The action scenes are imaginative and elaborate without seeming fake. Nothing is belabored, and the stakes never stop escalating. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber offer vivid support as two distinctly different government types (the unimaginative suit and the independent thinker), and the movie never forgets the human element. Salt always has a strong emotional reason for what she does.For Jolie, it's the best of both worlds. For once, she gets to be a woman and a superwoman in the same movie.-- Advisory: This movie contains lots of violence.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie The A-Team. Action. Starring Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper and Jessica Biel. Directed by Joe Carnahan. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The characters in The A-Team are in possession of esoteric knowledge: They know what's going on in the movie. To each other, they talk about various people and situations, and we just sit patiently, accepting that they know what they're doing, that it will all work out for the best. Kind of like watching a Latin Mass.Yet somehow this is OK. The A-Team is a Joe Carnahan movie, i.e., an experiment in propulsion and personality over substance and story. Carnahan directs as if his audience were made up of creatures without thought or memory, who can be distracted only by flashing images and wisecracks. The characters he places onscreen are without interest. Their problems are not our problems. But the sheer motion, the spectacle and the flashes of wit take The A-Team out of the realm of garbage. It's fun.The movie is based on the TV show of the same name, which was considered lowbrow in the 1980s. But that was before the collapse of Western civilization, so the filmmakers had their work cut out for them. Carnahan and co-screenwriters Brian Bloom and Skip Woods introduce the main characters over the course of a long and entertaining credits sequence, in which Hannibal (Liam Neeson) is about to be devoured by dogs and Face (Bradley Cooper) is about to be burned alive. Face, apparently, had sex with his tormenter's wife, and before the angry husband lights the match, he asks why. Well, she's so hot, and we both hate you, so ... The attitude is offensive, but the logic unassailable.The movie also introduces Quinton Rampage Jackson as Baracus, the role made famous by Mr. T. Actually, Mr. T was so distinct, even for those of us who weren't fans of the show, that to see Jackson here is to think, Who is this nice guy going around in a Mr. T costume? The script gives Jackson plenty of opportunities to say, I pity the fool, but he just doesn't have the anger - or the comedy. There's something missing there. After the credits, things settle down for about a minute or two to give the audience not quite a story, but a pretext for the ensuing action: Some Arabs are in possession of authentic $100 plates and will soon be printing billions and billions of dollars in counterfeit currency, which will result in ... oh, I dunno, the collapse of the world economic system, the end of life as we know it, take your pick. Basically, the only thing between us and disaster is the morons in this movie. They have to get the plates! Get the plates! This becomes the movie's mantra. Along the way, we meet Jessica Biel as a Defense Department agent who used to be in love with Face, but now she hates him. Biel needs careful handling as an actress, and Carnahan is not the one to give it to her. And so with this film, she assumes the crown once held by Jessica Alba as the movie star with the most profound inverse relationship between her good looks and her acting ability.Neeson and Cooper pick up the slack, with Cooper especially showing a comic insouciance that we haven't seen before. The action sequences are imaginative and on a grand scale, and every so often someone gets off a good line. It would probably be for the best if Carnahan might drink one less Red Bull before showing up on the set or in the editing room. But by the end of The A-Team, there's the sense of having had a full movie meal - most of it empty calories, but with lots of opportunities for seconds and thirds.-- Advisory: This film contains lots of violence.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie The Invention of Lying. Comedy. Starring Ricky Gervais and Jennifer Garner. Directed by Ricky Gervais and Matthew Robinson. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Take time to appreciate it, because right now we're in the midst of a strong era for screen comedy, with filmmakers pushing limits, bending genres and using comedy to advance serious ideas. The newest installment in this trend is The Invention of Lying, in which Ricky Gervais, instead of resting on formula and on a familiar persona, uses his first opportunity as a big-screen actor-director to make an original comedy that expresses some real thinking and feeling.  The Invention of Lying, in addition to being very funny and inventive, is an attempt at a genuine statement about life, social discourse and morality. Ultimately, Gervais may bite off more than he can chew, but this movie shows he's going for the brass ring. First time out of the box, he's heading into Woody Allen territory.  The movie takes place in an alternate-universe modern-day America in which no one has ever told a lie - in which the concept of lying is not even understood. Gervais plays Mark, a sad sack who one day stumbles upon the one talent that can unlock the universe and give him fame and wealth: He, alone among his fellow man, can lie. He can invent stories that are made into screenplays. He can go into banks and withdraw as much money as he wants. He can invent a heroic past for himself to impress women. He is alone in a world of pushovers. Much more than Liar, Liar and other comedies about the hazards of telling the truth, The Invention of Lying forces audiences to see how much lying permeates social life. In the movie's first scene, Mark shows up for a first date with Anna (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that she has no intention of ever going to bed with him. He reacts by announcing that he's about to get fired from his job and that he's not sure that the restaurant he's chosen is any good. And on and on. The audience laughs, recognizing that the outrageous things being said could easily form the undertone of any first date. When Mark soon develops the ability to lie, Gervais invites us to consider the kindly aspect of lying - of telling people what they want to hear. In its comic way, the movie demonstrates how lies feed the imaginations and in some cases make life bearable. At the same time, lies can be self-serving and dangerous. To see The Invention of Lying is to think about the degree to which lies run the world. Just that would have been enough to form the intellectual backdrop for a serious-minded comedy. But Gervais and co-writer and director Matthew Robinson are also interested in religion. Gervais, who has talked about his atheism in his other work as a comedian, sees religion as a kind of ultimate lie, one that has been used for good and ill. This is an enormous subject, one obviously close to Gervais' heart, but one that proves a little unwieldy. One consequence of the filmmakers' ambition is that The Invention of Lying never completely arrives and ends up promising more than it delivers. But it delivers enough. Onscreen, Gervais has something Jackie Gleason had: His eyes are rarely involved in the comedy. His eyes are fixed rather on the serious intention or emotion underlying the comedy. This weighty mental quality allows him to segue seamlessly from comic high jinks to drama. For example, he has a tearful breakdown in The Invention of Lying that eschews any sense of laugh-clown-laugh self-indulgence. It plays simply like the organic unfolding of the character. Jennifer Garner has never been better onscreen. Usually consigned to roles in which she's either blandly nice or some ridiculous superhero, Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before. She is both poignant and absurd, trying to keep up with a man whose lies give him an aura of brilliance and originality. The cast is rounded out nicely with some good comic actors in smaller roles (Louis C.K., Jonah Hill, Tina Fey) and cameos (Christopher Guest, Edward Norton). Together they give the sense of a community coming out to launch Gervais on his new venture. Consider him launched.  -- Advisory: This film contains sex talk and sexual situations.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie The Joneses. Starring Demi Moore, David Duchovny and Gary Cole. Directed by Derrick Borte. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The Joneses. They're the people that others want to keep up with. That tendency isn't healthy. It can even be self-destructive, according to The Joneses, an observant comedy-drama. Yet this movie is no caustic indictment of consumerism. Instead, it's sensitive to the real human longing behind the impulse for acquisition, which can sometimes be a sort of misdirected desire for more spiritual things.People want to fit in. They want to be liked and admired. They want to feel good about their lives. And so when the Joneses come to town - an ideal family, headed by Kate (Demi Moore), the glamorous mom, and Steve (David Duchovny), the confident, affable dad - their neighbors want to be just like them. Perhaps they can't aspire to be as beautiful as Kate or as self-assured as Steve, but they can buy the products they buy. And so they do. That, it turns out, has always been the plan, because in this shrewd examination of consumer culture, the Joneses are not a family at all. They are salespeople posing as an American family, while surreptitiously representing a host of products for a variety of clients. Steve talks up his car and his golf clubs. Kate talks up her hair products, and their kids - that is, the teenagers posing as their kids - get their friends interested in an alcohol-laden juice drink. Sales go up, and the Joneses' acquaintances never know they've been carefully manipulated. Don't get bogged down in the logistics, such as Would this work? and Would it really be cost-effective for advertisers to bankroll a family in an upscale community for an entire year? The Joneses is not meant to be realistic, but a parable contrasting consumerism with the true yearnings of the soul. The idea is that in a consumer culture, when people feel restless and unsatisfied, instead of looking inward, they look outward for something to buy. And when that doesn't satisfy, they buy something else, and keep distracting themselves in this way, without ever taking time to examine or truly live their lives. The beauty of The Joneses is that the salesmen are as much the victims as the people they're deceiving. They become addicted to their lives of comfort and begin to prefer the illusion of their pretend lives over their real ones. In truth, Steve is a fledgling salesman on his first assignment, and Kate is his boss. When they begin to feel stirrings of attraction for each other, is this something to take seriously or just the inevitable consequence of play-acting? In an entertaining way, the movie says something challenging, that it's possible to lose your life to stuff - and never even know it.By the way, a special mention needs to be made of Moore's physical appearance in this film. I have no idea what she did. Maybe she gained 5 pounds, maybe she's eating lots of vegetables, maybe she has a very hideous painting of herself hidden in the closet. But she looks, literally, 10 years younger than she did in Bobby, which she made in 2006. In any case, like a lot of people, I, too, would prefer to look the way I did in 1996, so I'm hoping she'll reveal her secret.-- Advisory: This film contains drug use, strong language and sexual situations.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie The Last Station. Drama. Starring Helen Mirren, Christopher Plummer, Paul Giamatti and James McAvoy. Directed by Michael Hoffman. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)It wasn't easy being Countess Tolstoy, stuck in the same house with a rich, world-renowned husband who insisted on living like a peasant and a saint, when he was neither. How much fun could it have been to see him surrounded by worshipers, sycophants and sponges, knowing that at any minute, in some grand spiritual gesture, he might sign away all his wealth - to them? For a century, the wife of the mighty author of War and Peace has been usually portrayed as a nagging, materialistic harpy, but The Last Station tells the story of Leo Tolstoy's last year from a refreshing new perspective. It stars Helen Mirren as the countess, which automatically makes her both likable and forceful. The film presents her as a woman surrounded by enemies in her own home, with a much older husband so guilt-ridden about his wealth that he might be willing to buy his way into heaven - at the expense of his wife's inheritance. The appeal of The Last Station is not in what it reveals about the Tolstoys' domestic life. In fact, few will come away from the film believing they've seen anything like the whole story of this marriage or anything close to its genuine dynamic. However, they will see Mirren in a juicy role that showcases her in a variety of modes - panicky, bitchy, seductive, warm, maternal, scheming, self-knowing, funny. And they will see Christopher Plummer (as Tolstoy) wearing big facial hair and peasant clothes, laughing in that time-honored British version of Russian gusto.  No one is joking in The Last Station, but it's all in fun, nonetheless. You won't believe for one second that Plummer wrote Anna Karenina, but after a while you will accept that, in this alternate universe, Tolstoy probably did sing Edelweiss in The Sound of Music. You will even grow to like this casting, because Plummer is big and generous in the role, bogus and yet sincere, and because there's something delightful and ridiculous about actors. An actor can be 80 years old, but give him fake whiskers and a pair of heavy boots, and he'll stomp through a two-hour movie like a happy kid. Meanwhile, as his elders have all the fun, James McAvoy has the role of straight man in this enterprise, as Valentin, hired to be Tolstoy's assistant. A devoted Tolstoyan, one of a group of followers who have set up a religion based on Tolstoy's teachings, Valentin is devoted to chastity and lives in a commune. As a Tolstoyan, it's also expected that he should be the enemy of Countess Tolstoy. In fact, his superiors in the movement - particularly Paul Giamatti as Chertkov, the Tolstoyan leader - have placed young Valentin in the household as a spy, to report on everything Mrs. Tolstoy might do to thwart the Tolstoyan movement.In films such as Wanted and The Last King of Scotland, McAvoy mastered the fine art of playing discomfort, and The Last Station gives him lots of opportunities to be uncomfortable: He works for his hero. He keeps ending up in the middle of domestic arguments. What's more, he finds his loyalties shifting from the count to the countess.Valentin provides an interesting window into the Tolstoy household, and his own journey from Tolstoyan asceticism to a more balanced embrace of life gives the film an extra dimension. But for much of the action, he's little more than a witness, so ineffectual that I just assumed he was a fictional creation. In fact, Valentin Bulgakov was a real person - one who probably spent a lot of time just standing around.Along the way, almost in passing, director Michael Hoffman shows celebrity culture, as it was forming in 1910 and the perennial difficulties of living a spiritually committed life while surrounded by fans and cameras. The Last Station doesn't necessarily add up as a completely coherent or satisfying statement, but all its elements are pleasing. This is light entertainment for a literate audience.

"Watch the trailer for the movie The Messenger.Drama. Starring Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson and Samantha Morton. Directed by Oren Moverman. (R. 105 minutes. At the Lumiere in San Francisco.)Two soldiers show up at a suburban home, the door opens and they deliver the awful news: The secretary of the Army regrets to inform ... Someone is dead - a son or daughter, a husband or wife - and the person hearing those words has to go through a rapid process of shock and disbelief, ending finally in the realization that the dreaded thing is happening. This is the nightmare for anyone with a loved one serving in the military.The Messenger is a privileged glimpse into people's private pain, a drama shot with the simplicity and immediacy of a documentary. It presents the above scenario from an angle most of us have never considered, that of the soldiers whose ongoing assignment is to deliver bad news. It shows the kinds of things that happen to these men in the course of their work and the psychological toll it takes, and it features two exceptional performances - from Woody Harrelson, as an officer who specializes in this, and Ben Foster, as a sergeant forced into the assignment. Along the way, The Messenger conveys a sense of military culture, specifically that of soldiers who return from battle to family and friends who can't possibly understand what they've been through. Foster, with little dialogue and with not much more than his facial aspect and bearing, conveys the sense of a soldier who saw horrors and feels disoriented back in the world of smiling faces and Have a good one.The last thing he needs, in his remaining months of active duty, is to be assigned as partner to Capt. Stone (Harrelson), as the messenger no one ever wants to see. Their scenes at the doors of loved ones are genuinely harrowing, each one distinct and raw, and filmed continuously, with a minimum of cutting. At times, it's almost too much, like spying on strangers in the worst moment of their lives. But mostly, it feels like seeing real pain that deserves real acknowledgment. In recent years, Harrelson has proved himself a versatile actor with a shrewd understanding of himself as an instrument. His crazy-eyed smile has served him well in roles ranging from clueless good-old boys to zany hippies. But the reason he can play such parts is because he's not those parts but, rather, a very shrewd actor with lots of honesty and little vanity. In The Messenger, he shows us Capt. Stone's limitations, with a sensitive understanding of how such a fundamentally simple guy, without much in the way of intellectual resources, might react under this kind of crushing stress. For those of us who have been taking Harrelson seriously, this is the performance to point to and say, See?Samantha Morton plays a war widow with whom the young sergeant strikes up a friendship. Director Oren Moverman films their scenes with long takes, sometimes using just one setup, creating a sense of really being there. There's only one moment where a little more cutting might have helped an actor. I don't know if the problem was Foster or the writing, but I didn't quite buy it.It also is worth noting that there are pockets where the energy drops out of The Messenger. Worth noting, yes. But big deal. When 2009 is over, this is one of the movies we'll remember the year by.-- Advisory: This movie contains strong language, full frontal nudity (female) and sexual situations.",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie The Runaways. Drama. Starring Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart. Directed by Floria Sigismundi. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)The strength and beauty of The Runaways are that it tells the truth. It doesn't always tell the literal truth about the pioneering all-girl rock band, the Runaways, though it gets the basic facts and most of the details right. More crucially, it conveys precisely what it was like to be young in the mid-1970s, a peculiar juncture in American social history. Back then, there was an almost post-apocalyptic feeling in the air, that all norms had been tossed aside, that nothing mattered, that the whole country and the world had spun out of control. Other films have attempted to convey this. Ang Lee's The Ice Storm got a piece of this feeling, but it couldn't get all of it. Its failure was that it was, in a sense, too good a movie, too artful. The Runaways, by contrast, is precisely the kind of gritty, seamy and occasionally awkward picture that the 1970s deserve. And in getting that one thing right - in capturing that strange combination of despair and frustrated energy - it gets everything right. It explains why kids needed rock 'n' roll, and why the Runaways still mean so much to those who remember them.Based on Neon Angel, the memoir of lead singer Cherie Currie, The Runaways tells the story of the creation of the band, focusing mainly on Joan Jett, who became the group's rhythm guitarist and principal songwriter, and Currie, who was discovered by Jett and producer Kim Fowley at Los Angeles nightclub when she was 15. They liked her look (a little Bowie, a little Bardot) and had no idea whether she could sing. She could. To be a teenager can feel like being stuck in mud. The world is alive with promise and excitement, but you can't get to it. You have no power. But music gives the feeling of power, the illusion of it, and sometimes that's enough to keep you sane. Currie (Dakota Fanning) and Jett (Kristen Stewart) start off as rock-obsessed high school misfits, Currie with a falling-apart family and an obsession with David Bowie, and Jett with her leather gear and a dream of becoming a female rocker - of a variety that did not yet exist. The Runaways shows how rock 'n' roll can save your life and almost wreck it. The soundtrack includes artists that influenced the Runaways (such as Suzi Quatro), original Runaways recordings and live re-creations of Runaways songs, with Fanning singing lead vocals. It all sounds terrific, though it must be said that Fanning isn't half the singer Currie was. Where Fanning excels is in suggesting the misery and confusion under the assumed air of teenage cool, and the gradual loss of herself to all the pressures and the drugs. She becomes the prime whipping girl for Fowley, ably played by Michael Shannon as an almost demonic presence, part sadistic idiot, part rock 'n' roll seer. Stewart, known mainly for mumbling and stumbling through the Twilight movies, is the revelation here. She has made a meticulous study of Jett - of her posture, her manner, her expressions, even in the way thoughts cross her eyes. And she has Jett's stage manner down, the way this seemingly shy person assumes total authority when she gets up to play. The visuals help - the costuming and art direction are spot-on.At the heart of The Runaways is Fanning and Stewart and their portrait of an unlikely friendship between two very different teenage girls - a friendship that, for a time, becomes very close indeed. It's also a showbiz story, of one girl who just didn't want success bad enough, and another who recognized her chance and clung to it like a lifeline.Some will complain, understandably, that The Runaways ultimately tells a downbeat story that drifts and fades into a diminuendo. It feels ungainly, as though something else - something big - should be happening. But no, the filmmaker knew exactly what she was doing: It just wouldn't be the '70s if it didn't leave audiences with a cocaine hangover. ",1
"Watch the trailer for the movie Valentine's Day.Romantic comedy. Starring Jennifer Garner, Ashton Kutcher, Patrick Dempsey, Jessica Biel, Taylor Swift and Shirley MacLaine. Directed by Garry Marshall. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)Like most Garry Marshall films, Valentine's Day is warm and pleasant and full of nice people. Also like a lot of Garry Marshall films, this warm pleasantness occasionally feels forced. In Marshall's movies, people are nicer than people are in real life - and less complicated and less interesting. Ever so faintly, everyone in a Marshall movie, whether we're talking about Beaches or Pretty Woman, Georgia Rule or Valentine's Day, acts like a small child.Behind this, I suspect, is a genuinely benign vision of life, one that has its appeal and speaks well of Marshall the man, even if it doesn't always do Marshall the artist any favors. To put it simply, this is a filmmaker who is always going to present the world as an essentially kind place populated by hapless, well-meaning people. And he's going to do that no matter what the subject is, short of the Nuremberg trials. So the whole key with Marshall is in finding material suited to this inevitable message. The good news is that with Valentine's Day, he finds a pretty good match. At its worst - fortunately, the movie is not often at its worst - there are moments of fake sincerity and even flat-out dishonesty: Sometimes characters do things they would not do and neglect to say things that they absolutely would say. But these flaws are more than balanced by an appealing atmosphere that pervades the whole movie, an almost holiday feeling. The running time is 125 minutes, a lot for a romantic comedy, but the minutes fly by.The cast includes many famous names and faces, so many that, if the movie were a drama, they would intrude on the film's illusion of reality. In a way, they intrude on the reality here, as well, but in a welcome way, contributing a sense of something just a bit fantastic, an imaginary pageant of life in contemporary Los Angeles. Here, you're asked to believe in Julia Roberts as an American soldier, and in Ashton Kutcher as a scruffy florist, and in Jessica Biel and Jennifer Garner as two women who can't find a decent guy. But you're not really asked to believe it but rather to enjoy the spectacle and accept the ride.At the center of the movie are two relationships, neither perfect. As the sun rises on Valentine's Day, the florist - a young, heart-on-his-sleeve kind of fellow - surprises his girlfriend (Jessica Alba) with a wedding ring. The girl says yes. Meanwhile, in another part of town, Julia (Garner) is waking up with her new boyfriend, a surgeon, and she's bemoaning that they won't be able to spend the evening together. He has to go to San Francisco to perform an operation ... or so he says. The cardiologist is played by Patrick Dempsey. Would you believe him?All ages are represented. There are a pair of 18-year-old lovers planning to have sex for the first time. (They don't, in an example of movie squeamishness not in keeping with the Valentine's Day spirit.) And there is a couple in their 70s, played by Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine. Apparently, MacLaine plays an actress in the movie, because at one point there's an outdoor screening of a MacLaine film from the 1950s. In an affecting shot worthy of G.W. Pabst, Marshall puts both MacLaines - old and young, both enacting a love scene - in the same frame. Just lovely.There are lots of cameos, as well, too many to count. However, it is worth mentioning that singer Taylor Swift shows up in a couple of scenes, playing a vapid Valley girl, and she's very funny.-- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations.",1
"Water Lilies: Drama. Starring Pauline Acquart, Louise Blachere and Adele Haenel. Directed by Celine Sciamma. (Not rated. 85 minutes. In French with English titles. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times, and to buy tickets for select theaters, go to sfgate.com/movies.)  This French movie, about teenage girls first discovering powerful sexual feelings, is being released in the United States under the unfortunate and misleading title Water Lilies. The treatment of these girls is anything but corny, but the title is, and it's enough to distort the experience of the film. Knowing the original French title at least helps. It's Naissance des Pieuvres. In English: The Birth of the Octopuses. Now think about that. Imagine you have two movies about blossoming female sexuality. One is called Water Lilies and the other is called The Birth of the Octopuses. Which one would you go see? The one that just floats there or the one with eight arms? One of these days, somebody somewhere will figure out how to distribute foreign films in the United States, and maybe then these movies might start making money. The picture plays, at first, as a series of incidents in the life of young Marie (Pauline Acquart), a 15-year-old girl. She has a friend, Anne (Louise Blachere), who is interested in swimming, and Marie becomes interested in swimming as well. Because she can't officially come to swim practices until she is a member of the team, she makes friends with Floriane (Adele Haenel), who gets her into swim practice every afternoon. Watching Water Lilies is a little like being a parent and having no idea what's going on with kids these days. If you're not paying attention - if you've been lulled by the title into expecting a placid little film about youth and friendship - you might not notice the roiling emotion underneath the seemingly tranquil surface of things. You could easily think this is simply the story of a girl who really, really wants to be on a synchronized swim team. If Marie is at the center of Water Lilies, Floriane is the center of everyone's focus within the movie. Though a teenager, she has the body of a woman, the gravity of an adult and a face that, in some lights, looks as though she's about 30. Known as the loose woman of the swim team, she is both cold and flirtatious, and she treats Marie, at least for a while, as little better than a minion. In exchange for getting Marie into swim practice, Floriane demands that Marie serve as her decoy. Floriane uses Marie as a cover so that she can see her boyfriends. But everything in Water Lilies is more guarded, more complex and far more interesting than it seems. There are two ways to enjoy this movie. One way is to focus on surface externals and then look back, at the finish, to realize that big emotional movements have been going on all along. And the other is to pay close attention and appreciate the subtlety and respect with which director Celine Sciamma treats her characters throughout. Water Lilies - or rather, The Birth of the Octopuses - is the first feature film by Sciamma, who was only 26 when she made it, a good age from which to look back on the teenage experience, before the calcification that comes with distance, sentimentality and nostalgia. Her point of view is fresh, and her control is mature. That's a strong combination. -- Advisory: Frontal nudity, sexual situations.",1
"We Dont Live Here Anymore: Drama. Starring Mark Ruffalo, Laura Dern, Peter Krause and Naomi Watts. Directed by John Curran. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Americans may not often film this kind of story, and yet We Don't Live Here Anymore is refreshingly, distinctly American. Unlike every Continental film about adultery, it tells its story without the raised eyebrow, without cynicism. Sex is serious. Infidelity brings guilt. A sense of responsibility hangs over the characters, particularly Mark Ruffalo as Jack, who initiates an affair with his best friend's wife, Edith (Naomi Watts). To spend 10 minutes with Jack is to know his mental loop, his wondering which woman to be with, which one he loves, and what's to be done about the kids. It's to see a harrowing example of someone who doesn't know himself. Jack is married to Terry, played by Laura Dern, who feels her husband's drift from her but has no evidence of his infidelity. Something of a drinker and emotionally out of control, her mode is to lash out, make accusations and apologize later. The least intellectual of the spouses, Terry has the humility to think she might be imagining things, and she has the motive to doubt herself, too -- she loves her husband. Their arguments are painful to watch, because she's really trying to communicate, and he's just trying to confuse her. The Jack-Terry arguments can almost exhaust an audience, making viewers feel as if they're stuck in that marriage, too. But they have the ring of truth: The spouses see the arguments before they arrive, and yet they stand there and let them happen. They argue about everything, including things they're not really concerned about. And by next morning, there's a truce, but it's entirely a function of exhaustion and proximity, not reconciliation. By contrast, Edith and her husband, Hank (Peter Krause) never argue, but then they don't really talk. Like Jack, Hank teaches in the college, but unlike Jack, he is also a writer. Caught up in his own inner life, he assumes a blithe facade in his daily existence, a benign face on what is really a rather chilly indifference. He doesn't have much to offer a wife who, as played by Watts, is a woman of vivacity and intelligence just coming into her own power. So why shouldn't Jack and Edith get together? They make a sexy couple, and the fireworks they make are the only sparks in their dreary existence. Who could blame them? And yet we do blame them, and they blame themselves. Their passion can only relieve itself. Scenes with their respective children -- kids are usually avoided in adultery movies, but not in this one -- are painful, with each parent suddenly feeling like an impostor, someone obliged to assume a cheerful demeanor, even the kids' world is being undermined. Hemingway wrote that All things truly wicked start from an innocence. In We Don't Live Here Anymore, the characters share an innocent belief in the right to pursue happiness, and the equally naive expectation that such a state is their due. Out of this faith comes cruelty and emotional perversity. Often the characters don't even know what's driving them. But we do. It's one of the great pleasures offered by this movie, the privileged view into extreme human behavior. The direction, by John Curran, is superior, not only for the uniform strength and subtlety of the performances but also for the way Curran juggles the perspectives of all the spouses. Part of the credit goes to Larry Gross, for his intelligent screenplay. But it's also a function of editing. Curran is constantly flashing for two or three seconds at a time, either to show what someone is thinking or to let us see what is happening concurrently in the other household. The possibilities for such intercutting are almost infinite. Curran chooses his moments well. Also notable is the sound design, full of echoes and mystical chords that create the sense that, in these specific lives, something is playing out both universal and inexpressibly sad. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and simulated sex.

"Well, it’s August. These are the doldrums. The summer, as a movie season at least, is effectively over, and the fall hasn’t started yet. Perhaps for that reason, “The Hitman’s Bodyguard” seems just a little better than it really is.For the record, it’s a pleasing action movie that aspires to be something more, but doesn’t quite achieve its intention. But it really is pleasing and better than routine, and it has a way of topping itself. So if, after about 80 minutes, you think the movie is offering you its big climax, that it’s giving you all it’s got, it’s not. It goes on to catch a second wind and gets bigger and wilder and even more satisfying.The movie also is a chance to appreciate Samuel L. Jackson in something close to his purest form. Other movies, after all, have other reasons for being. There are roles to be cast and actors to play them. But it’s hard to imagine any reason for this movie’s existing but for the fact that Jackson was willing to be in it. It’s impossible  to imagine it even making sense without the menacing joviality that he brings to it — and also his history with the audience, our shared feeling of knowing this actor and of being in on his particular comic wavelength.“The Hitman’s Bodyguard” pairs Jackson here with Ryan Reynolds, and sprinkled throughout we get moments that suggest an attempt — by Tom O’Connor’s screenplay and Patrick Hughes’ direction — to turn the movie into a buddy action-comedy. But O’Connor and Hughes aren’t quite sure whether they’re making a buddy action-comedy or lampooning the genre, and so their attempt is stuck somewhere in between. This is less a problem than it sounds, though, because, lampoon or not, Jackson and Reynolds are good together.Reynolds plays Bryce, a former CIA agent specializing in  first-class (“Triple-A rated”) protection for corporate clients who feel their lives might be in danger. In an opening scene, we meet him in flashback, giving the deluxe treatment to a Japanese businessman. He and his team escort the gentleman to the tarmac and see that he is safely boarded onto his private jet. And then just as they are all congratulating themselves for a job well done, the businessman is assassinated through the window of the plane.This is what passes for slapstick in “The Hitman’s Bodyguard” — assassination as punchline. If you don’t think you could possibly consider that funny, this fine cinematic exercise is not for you.Anyway, two years later, Bryce needs a shave; his love life is nonexistent, and his once top-flight business is a shadow of itself. Then one day he gets a phone call from his estranged ex-girlfriend, an Interpol agent played by  French actress Elodie Yung: She needs him to escort a notorious hit man (Jackson, of course) to the Hague, where he is to testify against a really, really horrible war criminal (Gary Oldman, of course). The only catch is that there are many dozens of heavily armed criminals and corrupt Interpol agents who want to make sure that this testimony never happens.Does this story have a certain familiar ring? The last time somebody made this movie, it was called “Hot Pursuit,” with Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara — essentially a road trip comedy about a pair of opposites, whose slowly blossoming friendship keeps getting interrupted by violent interludes. That movie collapsed into total discord, but “The Hitman’s Bodyguard” finds a tonal universe in which the violence and the comedy are not in conflict. Then again, perhaps the tone didn’t really have to be arrived at. Perhaps the tone was just a given, something that was automatically built in from the moment  Jackson appeared on the set.Aside from the principals, who are everything they should be, there is Oldman, who is appropriately repellent in a couple of key scenes, and  Yung, who makes a nice impression of strength and purpose as the Interpol agent. In a sense, Oldman and Yung play dramatic characters in the midst of a comedy, but the filmmakers weave them into the flow. Meanwhile, Salma Hayek stands out in a comic role as the hit man’s impossibly vulgar, assertive wife.It’s also worth noting that there are lots of car chases here, and they actually aren’t boring. That qualifies as a rare achievement. ",1
"Wendy and Lucy: Drama. Starring Michelle Williams, Wally Dalton and Will Patton. Directed by Kelly Reichardt. (R. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)  Movies have a funny way sometimes of knowing the future. The latest example is Wendy and Lucy, which tells the story of a struggling young woman trying to make it to Alaska, so she can reach her idea of employment nirvana: a job in a fish-canning factory. This tale of poverty American-style was conceived and filmed when the Dow Jones was up around 11,000 and when the idea of going broke was, for most people, an abstract concept.  Going broke. Being poor. Getting down to your last buck. Wendy and Lucy may focus on one person, but its ambition is to make a larger point about what it's like to lose everything. Lack of means might be the easiest part. There's also the isolating loneliness of poverty, as well as the danger of it. There's that way poverty has of perverting relationships, inspiring disdain and eating into self-esteem. Wendy and Lucy shows all this and, with an uncanny prescience, presents it at precisely the moment when audiences are capable of receiving it, not with distance, but with empathy. And some real fear. The film, written and directed by Kelly Reichardt, has a European aura that can only be intentional. Those with even a scant familiarity with Italian cinema, for example, will see the parallels between this young woman-and-her-dog story and Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D., about a retired old man struggling to maintain his dignity in the face of degrading poverty. (He had a dog, too.) That parallel in itself contains a message: The conditions that produced Italian neorealism have come to the United States.  (Wouldn't it be nice if we could get movies of such sterling quality without having to go through the national pain that inspires them?) In more general terms, Wendy and Lucy seems European in its focus on the individual and in its social concern, measured pace and modest length - a length perfectly suited to the material. Too often American directors wreck their movies by taking an 80-minute idea and stretching it to 110 minutes. Long doesn't mean important, and short doesn't mean trivial. Wendy and Lucy provides a concentrated dose of affecting human drama. A deglamorized Michelle Williams (bad clothes, cropped hair, no makeup) plays Wendy, whose car breaks down in Oregon. That she breaks down while still in the continental United States is essential to the tale. Had she broken down in Canada, it would have meant something else, but this is an American story about an American problem.  Her best friend in the world is her dog, Lucy - in fact, the dog might be her only friend. The dog is yellow and vivid and, though a bitch, a fine actress, as is often the case. Because of circumstances I won't reveal (even though they unfold in the first 20 minutes), Wendy and Lucy become separated. The rest of the movie consists mainly of Wendy's trying to find Lucy, while looking for a way to get her car fixed, so they can continue on their journey. The film captures the mercilessness of a small town in the middle of the night - the headlights and rushing sounds of the interstate, the train whistles, the brightly lit gas stations with no one in them, the deserted streets. In one scene, Wendy decides to sleep in the woods and wakes up to a crazy homeless man's haranguing her about his rights and how he doesn't like being treated like trash. (A very American lunatic, he wants respect as much as he wants money.) Reichardt films the scene with great taste and economy - just a close-up of Williams' terrified eyes. Williams is equally impressive in moments that call for less intensity, that demand only a lived-in sense of always having been close to the economic brink. In one telling scene, an old security guard (Wally Dalton) does her an unexpected good turn, and she seems embarrassed. She doesn't know how to act when people are nice to her. Unfortunately, there's a limit to how much anyone can help her: When you're broke, you tend to meet only people who are equally broke.  At the start of the movie, Wendy is part of the dysfunctional lower class, and her goal is to work very hard to make it into the functional lower middle class - and to keep from falling off the edge of society altogether. It's impossible to watch this film in January 2009 without being aware that, in an economic downturn, the people who don't have much to begin with stand the greatest chance of getting clobbered. That's the reality on the screen, and that's the truth in the movie theater. In this way, Wendy and Lucy - a film that might have seemed faintly academic six months ago - becomes an anxious expression of its historical moment. -- Advisory:Strong language and menacing situations.",1
"We’ve heard their playlists, watched them dance, and soon we’ll be able to see Barack and Michelle Obama on their first date.    Who catchin this in theaters?“Southside With You” is familiar and yet new. In its form — two people go on a long first date and just talk and talk — the movie is reminiscent of Richard Linklater’s “Before Sunrise” (1995), with Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. But here we also get the mythologizing of a sitting president, a detailed, semifictional account of Barack and Michelle Obama’s first date.Needless to say, if you don’t like President Obama, don’t bother seeing this. You won’t enjoy it, despite its virtues, because “Southside With You” is about two love stories, and one of them you’ll find annoying. There’s the burgeoning onscreen romance between Barack and Michelle, but then there’s the love story that the movie’s existence both implies and tries to feed — the romance between Obama and the American public. To see “Southside With You” is to come away assured that Obama has earned an unusually fond place in his countrymen’s affections.The film was written and directed by Richard Tanne (this is his first feature), who researched the Obamas’ first date with no help from the first family. Tanne pieced together as many details as he could from the historical record, and he made up the rest. For the record, Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson really did go to the Art Institute of Chicago, and to Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing.” They really did get ice cream, and the movie shows them having their first kiss at the time and place it actually happened. But the community meeting also depicted in the film may have occurred on an entirely different day.Of course, when the Obamas eventually see this movie, even they will have to agree that, if they didn’t say or do these things, they really should have. The casting is splendid. Tika Sumpter looks only slightly like Michelle, but she sounds exactly like her, and Parker Sawyers becomes Barack Obama over the course of the film. The voice is different, but there’s a sort of resemblance, not to mention an uncanny assumption of Obama’s manner, a combination of blitheness, deadpan humor, and sureness of reason and observation.The community-meeting scene, in which the 28-year-old Obama fills a room full of disappointed citizens with hope, is a tour de force of Tanne’s writing and Sawyers’ acting. In the scene, Obama’s audience starts off angry that their request for a community center has been turned down by the city government. But then Obama, in a speech very much in his signature style, invites the audience to let go of anger and judgment and to imagine the city’s rationale. Their goal, he says, is to “turn self-interest into mutual interest.” This is the movie’s equivalent of the scene in John Ford’s “Young Mr. Lincoln” (1939), in which the future president turns away a lynch mob through the force of his reason. The community scene is the moment when the audience thinks, “There he is. There’s the president in miniature.” And it has the same effect as the “Young Mr. Lincoln” lynch-mob scene: goosebumps. “Southside With You” proves once and for all that a romantic film doesn’t rely on suspense. We know these people are getting together. What holds us to our seats is wondering how  it will happen. At the start of the film, Michelle is very proper, almost a scold. She doesn’t want to get involved with a guy from work, especially one working under her. She’s a low-level associate at a prestigious Chicago law firm, and he’s a summer intern, in between terms at Harvard Law School.Throughout the film, he is casually, persistently and pleasantly in pursuit, and she’s holding him off, not wanting to be taken in by a smooth talker. Lots of luck with that. The ensuing conversations are interesting and believable, and Tanne resists the temptation to emphasize that which we can’t forget, anyway: These are young people with a remarkable destiny, and they don’t even know it yet. In fact, they’re not really going to have a hint of it for another 10 years. ",1
"What Alice Found: Thriller. Starring Emily Grace, Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. Directed by A. Dean Bell. (Not rated. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) An enigmatic Good Samaritan? What does that mean? Well, here's the problem: The great virtue of What Alice Found is that it is consistently surprising -- and surprising in different ways. Yet to explain this -- to go into any kind of real detail at all about the film -- would be to give away half the plot, and that will not be done here. So if the following recommendation is a little vague, just know that an explicit recommendation would demolish the experience of the movie. It's about an 18-year-old girl from the wrong side of the tracks in Massachusetts, who loves dolphins, because the one fun thing she ever did in her life is go to SeaWorld. Summer vacation is over, and a friend has already gone off to college in Miami to study marine biology. So Alice (Emily Grace) - - adventurous and unhappy -- decides to go on a road trip. In a beat-up car, she embarks on a thousand-mile journey. Along the way, she meets and is helped out by an older couple, Bill (Bill Raymond) and Sandra (Ivey), and they start traveling together. ... And that's all anybody needs to know. As for the rest, maybe nothing else happens. (This was, after all, a Sundance movie.) Maybe the whole thing is just a meeting of the minds, an exchange between generations, a heartfelt slice of life that leaves everyone better off for the experience. ... Or maybe not. I'm not talking. I will say that Ivey is fascinating, cooing nonstop in a cozy Southern accent, friendly and accepting, but also observant and oddly unknowable. It's a performance that even gets better on second viewing. As for newcomer Grace, she is all she needs to be as Alice, a gawky kid, wary but gullible, and always a little bit angry about something. She doesn't know why she's angry, only that she has a right to be. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language, sexual situations and full frontal nudity. ",1
"What a strange movie this is. “Aferim!” — the ironic title means Bravo! in Romanian — is funny in both senses of the word:  amusing and very odd. It’s unlike any film in memory, a historical drama that finds a strain of comedy, not by being silly, but by being accurate. The laughs come from our disorientation at witnessing a world that is insanely peculiar, so different from ours in its understanding of right and wrong that we sit in amazement.Based on an amalgam of true stories, the movie presents an essentially simple situation. The year is 1835. The place is the Wallachia region of Romania, and a constable (Teodor Corban) has been given an assignment by a wealthy landowner to capture and return an escaped slave. The landowner wants the slave back because he wants to exact punishment. The slave had sex with the landowner’s wife.The film has an episodic structure. The constable, accompanied by his son (Mihai Comanoiu), goes into various squalid little villages and asks if anyone has seen the slave. In between towns, the father and son talk, or rather the father talks, in long monologues punctuated by aphorisms, only some of which make sense (“When drunk, give no gifts and do no harm”). The first thing that strikes you is that the constable seems a rather genial fellow. The second thing is that he’s nasty and brutal to virtually every stranger he encounters.What we glean from this is that the constable is a man of basically decent disposition, but one of no independence or originality of thought, and so he reflects the morals and the practices of the world that he knows. He’s not a good person, but he’s most certainly not a wicked one, just someone who acts without thought, according to the accepted practices of his time.It’s the period of history that director Radu Jude wants us to notice. At one point, the father and son help a priest on the road, who launches into an insane, heated diatribe about why Gypsies are bad but Jews are worse, because Jews, according to him, are not even human. The monologue is so extreme it’s like something out of Monty Python, but what compounds the absurdity is that the constable listens to the priest while giving no indication that these are bizarre opinions. Apparently, in 1835, they weren’t. Along the way, the movie calls attention to a bit of history that most people don’t know, that for centuries the Romany people, known as Gypsies, were slaves in Eastern Europe. This practice continued into the 19th century. As the film wears on, we become increasingly aware that we are looking at a period in which people were owned, slaves by their masters, wives by their husbands. The movie establishes a quality of history by filming in black and white and shooting from a distance, so as to emphasize the broad picture.In one scene, a woman tells the constable that her husband beats her. He asks how he beats her, and when she tells him “with his fists,” he says that that’s perfectly legal, according to current law. He seems vaguely sympathetic, but not as though he necessarily thinks it’s a bad law. The moment is funny, but not entirely funny, and “Aferim!” never seems to try for the laugh. It gets the laugh without trying for it, while building toward something else, a despairing sense of how millions of people once had to live their lives.",1
"When a teenage boy starts imagining adulthood, the ideal vision is something like “Entourage”: living in a big house with all your friends, hanging out and having adventures. Lots of girls, lots of laughs, lots of parties and no money worries. It’s the promise of a spring and summer that never ends, a vision of heaven on earth.Ultimately, the vision matures and the goals change, but the memory lingers on, and that’s the appeal of “Entourage” and its irresistible depiction of an immature person’s paradise. Frankly, I can’t begin to imagine what women might see in this fantasy. But its appeal to men — or to the residual teenager that never completely leaves most men — is so clear and so gut-level it’s almost embarrassing.Four years after its eight seasons as an HBO series, “Entourage” is back as a feature film, and the first thing that needs to be said is that you don’t have to know the show to enjoy the movie. Years ago, I saw maybe one or two episodes and don’t remember them. However, those familiar with the show should know that the movie picks up a few months after the series left off — then plunges into the action with a velocity that makes an audience barely realize that every character is being reintroduced.As we enter the story, Vince (Adrian Grenier), the movie star, is on a yacht (of course he is), having just ended his marriage. His former agent, Ari (Jeremy Piven), is now head of a movie studio. Vince is directing and starring in a new movie and needs more money to finish it, but Ari can’t provide the money without permission from the co-producer, Billy Bob Thornton. Just imagine begging for money from Billy Bob Thornton. Do you think he’d be a sympathetic ear? The world of “Entourage” is one of sex and parties and a steady drumbeat of professional abuse and the ever-present possibility of career implosion. Vince leads a young man’s seemingly idyllic existence, but even he has to suck up to people for whom he has no respect, such as the producer’s ne’er-do-well son, played by the former child actor Haley Joel Osment. If “Entourage” signals the return of Osment, reborn as a character actor, that will be a very good thing. He is superb in this, by turns hapless and intimidating, stupid and shrewd, and wallowing in the unfair authority of money.The party scenes are entertaining fantasy, but the insider-business end of the picture is occasionally interesting in its own right. There’s an etiquette to the negotiations in “Entourage,” in which any time one person has an advantage over the other, the one in the privileged position insults, digs at and needles the other, but in a gentle way, as if to say, “You’re so low I don’t even have to raise my voice to insult you.” No wonder people get ulcers.As Vince, Grenier is like an abstraction of a movie star, an uninteresting guy who just happens to look a certain way, which makes it hard to believe that he could direct a great film. But certain things must be accepted for the movie’s wheels to go around. The people around him are a lot more amusing, particularly Piven, as a barracuda with a conscience. As Vince’s half brother, Kevin Dillon seems crude and far-fetched, though I suspect “Entourage” aficionados might like him best, the way “Sex and the City” fans tended to favor Samantha. “Entourage” abounds with celebrity cameos, some more welcome than others. Armie Hammer is particularly funny as an emotionally unhinged version of himself. But a scene in which Jessica Alba berates Ari, presumably with justification, just makes her seem crude. Still, if you don’t like that cameo, there’s another coming up in five minutes.",1
"When death comes to Jack Dodds, a popular butcher, his three best friends follow his last wishes to drive to the sea to scatter his remains. Chauffeured by Jack's burly and diffident son, they reminisce about World War II, old grudges and failed romances -- the signposts of decades of friendship. Based on Graham Swift's Booker Prize-winning novel and directed and written by Fred Schepisi, this is an enervated, overly muted drama that should have been a lot livelier, considering the terrific cast. Michael Caine is the late, jovial Jack. His widow is played by Helen Mirren, his friends by Tom Courtenay, Bob Hoskins and David Hemmings and his son by Ray Winstone. A number of unknowns play these characters in flashback -- Hemmings' son Nolan Hemmings does his dad as a youth -- and Laura Morelli is June, the autistic daughter Jack refused to raise. The actors do their best, particularly the impeccable Mirren, but Schepisi draws a shroud of chaste dullness over their scenes and lays on an energy- sapping score that seems to whisper, This material is dreary, and these people have lost their spirit and spunk. Surprisingly, the more enjoyable scenes take place in the past and don't involve Caine, Mirren and the other veteran actors. The action moves constantly between present and past, which isn't a bad narrative scheme, but when it's done so frequently and deliberately, we feel as if we're looking over Schepisi's shoulder as he diagrams the whole story for us. Advisory: This film contains nudity and violence. -- Edward Guthmann  Comedy. Starring Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn. Directed by Michael Kalesniko. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog gets most of the big things wrong and almost all the little things right. For two-thirds of its running time, it's a nasty little delight with an amusing and curmudgeonly central character. Then it veers into sentimentality, dishonesty and confusion and leaves us with a suspicion that it was heading nowhere all along. Kenneth Branagh stars as a British playwright living in Los Angeles, a former boy wonder who hasn't had a hit in seven years. Everything annoys or threatens him. His insomnia is aggravated by the neighbor's barking dog, and he's panic-stricken by his chipper wife's desire to have a baby, so panicked that he has become impotent. A visit to a doctor's office results in one of the funniest prostate-exam scenes on film. Beyond individual bits, Branagh is both appealing and disconcerting as a writer who, in order to maintain a safe zone in which to work, must fend off distraction. Yet in the process he is fending off his wife (Robin Wright) and everything else -- cutting himself off from the very contact that might result in new material. Yet any hope that the film might offer insight into the writing life is soon squelched when we see the playwright in rehearsal for his new show and realize that writer-director Michael Kalesniko knows nothing about what a rehearsal looks like or what a playwright does. Had Kalesniko taken all of an hour or two to investigate the realities of his subject, he would have unearthed riches. Instead he took an acerbic gem of a character and grounded him in a world made of nothing but fey falsehood. Eventually, these falsehoods pile up, undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice. Advisory: This film contains strong language and an animal's death. -- Mick LaSalle . When Ram Dass suffered a serious stroke in 1997, he didn't have the cosmic moment one would expect he'd have. No shimmering epiphanies. Just a view of the pipes on the ceiling. Here I am, Mr. Spiritual, and in my own head I didn't orient toward the spirit, the Marin County resident recalls in the remarkable documentary Ram Dass: Fierce Grace. It showed me I have some work to do. That's a powerful statement coming from the former Harvard professor, spiritual lightning rod and best-selling author of Be Here Now. It's also the entry point to a journey that surprised Ram Dass and brought him wisdom in a manner he'd never anticipated. Director Mickey Lemle takes a gentle, loving approach as he traces the long arc of Ram Dass' life: his early years as Richard Alpert, son of a prominent Boston attorney; his psychedelic experiments and dismissal from Harvard; his journey to India, where he met his guru, Maharaj ji. Ram Dass' older brother, William, offers a wry, affectionate take on his brother's saga, and we hear the piercing testimony of an Ashland, Ore., couple who credit Ram Dass with assuaging their grief after the loss of their teenage daughter. Lemle (Compassion in Exile: The Story of the 14th Dalai Lama) has made a generous, inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith. It's impossible not to admire Ram Dass' bravery and insight, or feel his ecstatic joy as he sits in his wheelchair and weeps with happiness during a concert of Indian music by Bhagavan Das. For Ram Dass, illness and recovery proved an unexpected gift. I was galumphing through life before the stroke, he says. I'm at peace now more than I've ever been. The peace comes from settling in to the moment. -- Edward Guthmann . Anyone under the impression that popular opinion in Israel is more or less homogeneous will be disabused of that notion by Time of Favor. Written and directed by Joseph Cedar, who lived for a year in a West Bank settlement, this Israeli film takes a critical view of the settlement movement, though it's respectful of the people in it. The movie uses a love triangle to explore the line between religious devotion and dangerous fanaticism. Aki Avni plays Menachem, a handsome soldier who, at the encouragement of a rabbi, starts a military unit made up entirely of Orthodox yeshiva members. While building this military force, he meets and falls in love with the rabbi's daughter, Michal (Tinkerbell). But the rabbi has plans for Michal. He wants her to marry a scholar, Pini (Edan Alterman), who is also Menachem's best friend. So the setup is pedestrian. It's the setting that kicks this into another gear. Were this an American movie, Freddie Prinze Jr. would play Menachem, and Bruce Davison would play the rabbi, only he wouldn't be a rabbi but a congressman. But because this is the West Bank, every move is laced with meaning, a statement of one's values, and there's always the possibility of danger. The tone is balanced, reflective and reasonable. Avni is a major star in Israel, and he is an actor with world-class charm. The popularity of Tinkerbell, who goes through the movie scowling and sullen, is more elusive, though maybe it's the role. Nice name, though. This film contains violence. -- Mick LaSalle . In 1974, Robert Aldrich directed The Longest Yard, a prison comedy about a bunch of cons who challenge a team of guards to a game of football and wipe the field with them. Burt Reynolds starred in that one -- back in his prime -- and now the movie has been remade as Mean Machine and relocated to England, where, we're told, The Longest Yard is a classic. That's news to me, unless the language has disintegrated so badly that old and classic are now interchangeable. The new version is directed in a jazzy, hyped style by first-time filmmaker Barry Skolnick and stars Vinnie Jones, a real-life soccer hero who turned actor in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. Looking a bit like Sex and the City co-star John Corbett, Jones plays Danny Meehan, a disgraced soccer star who lost his career when he threw a game. Sent to prison for drunken driving and assaulting two cops, he wears the sullen mask of a man who'll never live down a tragic blunder. Mean Machine takes a long time getting started and doesn't hit its stride until Danny starts coaching a team of fellow cons -- think Bad News Bears, just nastier -- and guiding them toward a predictable ending. The working- class British slang is often impenetrable, and the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch, elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny. Jason Statham, Jones' co-star in Lock, Stock and Snatch, plays a loose- cannon goalie and David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) gets the Morgan Freeman role of a wizened lifer who bestows hard-earned wisdom on Danny. This movie contains profanity and physical violence. -- Edward Guthmann ",1
"When it comes right down to it, “Inferno” is all about vacation. The movie presents us with a series of popular destinations, all of which are photographed exquisitely, and over and over we find ourselves thinking, “Oh, I’ve been there! I remember that!” Or “That looks great, I have to go there.” And as we’re admiring the sights, people are shooting at Tom Hanks.“Inferno” is like vacation in another way — a brain vacation. It is a satisfying but thoroughly idiotic film, in which relationships make no sense, character motivations change on a dime, and Tom Hanks has weird hair. But brainless as it is, it’s artful. It is a well-made bit of silliness, a piece of construction optimally designed to maintain audience interest while garnering absolutely no one’s respect.In fact, if you put monetary considerations aside (which is a little like pushing a gorilla to the side), the movie almost qualifies as an act of collective altruism: Director Ron Howard and a talented cast set out to entertain — and succeed — all the while knowing that their reputations are not exactly going to be enhanced by this enterprise. The movie begins the festivities by throwing us into a surefire situation. Robert Langdon (Hanks), a noted expert in medieval and Renaissance symbols, wakes up groggy and drugged in a hospital. He thinks he’s in the United States, but looks out the window and sees Florence (a very nice view).A nice young doctor (Felicity Jones) tells him that his head was grazed by a bullet, that someone tried to kill him, and that the trauma has resulted in a temporary state of amnesia.Next thing you know, an assassin shows up at the hospital, and the doctor is pushing a very tired, disoriented symbols professor down the stairs, out the door and into the cab. All the while, he hallucinates. You might ask, what does an expert in symbology hallucinate? Scenes from “Dante’s Inferno” as painted by Botticelli, of course. Come on, everybody knows that. Meanwhile — you’re going to love this — there’s an insane billionaire (Ben Foster) out there who is as obsessed with overpopulation as Ross Perot used to be with the national debt. This billionaire thinks humanity is heading toward extinction due to overpopulation, and so he has devised a way to “cull the herd,” as it were. For the sake of our children and our children’s children, he wants to kill half the people on the planet. You know, fresh start, eliminate the deadwood. Somehow Langdon’s situation is directly related to the billionaire’s quest, though that connection is revealed only gradually. In the meantime, everybody is either chasing Tom Hanks, or shooting at him, or both. Not only are private assassins in pursuit, but so are the Italian police, members of an elite security firm and emissaries of the World Health Organization. And just to make things interesting/more absurd, the woman who runs WHO (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is the great lost love of Langdon’s life. So we have the spectacle of a man trying to get away ... from the woman who got away.The story, based on Dan Brown’s book, has two missions, one easy and one requiring real skill. The first is to keep you wondering what’s going on. The second is to keep you curious as to what is going on.Shifts in plot and character reversals arrive with a will of their own, and it becomes entertaining just to watch the actors try to find logical justifications for the utter nonsense coming out of their mouths. Brown tosses garbage out of a speeding car, and each time, the actors catch it and arrange it beautifully before it hits the ground. Every one of them is appealing or amusing. You want an audience to care about the fate of the protagonist, no matter what the situation? Cast Tom Hanks. You want a young actress who can suggest fierce intelligence and conviction? Cast Felicity Jones.The movie wants us to believe that a Swiss WHO doctor is Langdon’s great love, and of course that makes sense, not because Langdon would ever meet such a woman, but because we saw the same actress — Knudsen — with Hanks in “Hologram for the King.” So we know they have a history. Irrfan Khan is particularly impressive as the head of the nefarious security firm. His performance is a mix of self-satisfaction and self-disgust, of suppressed anger with the vague but unmistakable suggestion of some buried decency, and he creates for himself some of the movie’s best moments. He also looks terrific in an impeccable gray suit. That’s another thing about “Inferno”: Everybody looks crisp, tailored and of the moment. Obviously, not one of us would ever want to be chased through Europe by teams of international criminals in the service of a diabolical conspiracy. But if that were to happen, you’d want costume designer Julian Day picking out your clothes. Likewise, if you had to run for your life, Florence, Venice and Istanbul are premium locations. That way,  in your downtime, you can get in a little sightseeing.",1
"When you sit down to watch a Garry Marshall movie, you know what you’re getting: A nice world with nice people, in which the jokes aren’t funny and yet are clearly identifiable as well-meaning attempts at humor. There are lurches into sentiment that stand in for actual feeling, social attitudes that are benign but weird, and a multistar cast full of actors who seem to be having a good time.That said, “Mother’s Day” is about as bad as a movie can be without being remotely obnoxious. It’s mostly pleasing, or at least pleasant. No human being is quite human. No adult is quite adult. No situation completely makes sense. But the overall aura is kind of ... welcoming. It’s impossible to take seriously, but easy to take.If you’re keeping score, this is the third in Marshall’s holiday trilogy, and it occupies a space somewhere in between the pretty good “Valentine’s Day” (2010) and the awful “New Year’s Eve” (2011). Like its predecessors, it has a big cast, full of various, loosely connected characters going through big life events on the way to a holiday.Jennifer Aniston is a divorced wife and mother with a barely concealed desire to get back together with her suave husband (Tim Olyphant). Jason Sudeikis is a widower with two children, still grieving the death of his wife (Jennifer Garner, who shows up in one scene, on video). Britt Robertson is a young mother, who is reluctant to marry her boyfriend. And Julia Roberts is a cold, hard-driving home shopping entrepreneur, who seemingly has nothing to do with the other characters — but wait a while.Most peculiar of all are the sisters played by Kate Hudson and Sarah Chalke, who have moved across the country to keep their personal lives secret from their racist, homophobic parents: One is married to an Indian (Aasif Mandvi) and the other is married to a woman (Cameron Esposito). All is well, until Mom and Dad (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) show up uninvited and react in the ugly way their daughters expected.It’s hard to know who gets it worse. The older couple is like a red-state stereotype as seen through blue-state eyes. On the other hand, their nastiness and bigotry are forgotten and forgiven by the other characters as though it were a temporary indiscretion. Like so much of this film, the humor and the characters seem off. On three occasions, for example, someone goes out and does a stand-up routine that has the audience laughing with delight — that is, the audience within the movie — but the jokes aren’t funny.How is this possible? This is Garry Marshall. This is the man who created “The Odd Couple” TV series, among other successful comedies. He knows what’s funny — at least I assume he does. Then again, you know what happens when you assume.",1
"Where do these bureaucrats and functionaries learn this routine — this thing where they pretend that you’re crazy if you complain about something, if you catch them either doing something wrong or enforcing an injustice? You know, the singsong delivery, with lines like, “As I said to you before, sir” and “You’re creating a disturbance, ma’am,” and “You’re going to force me to call security.”I would say there must be some central school hidden somewhere in this country, but now there’s “I, Daniel Blake” to show that this isn’t only an American phenomenon. They’re doing it in England, too. It’s about a 59-year-old construction worker who gets out of the hospital after having a heart attack. His situation is pretty straightforward. He needs government assistance until his doctors can certify that he’s healthy enough to return to work.What follows is a Kafkaesque journey into government-agency hell. It’s directed by Ken Loach and can be looked at in one of two of ways. This is either the story of what happens when a government stops caring about its people — or it’s a story about how things go to hell once government gets involved at all. In any case, it’s about a system that seems designed to make people feel that they’re entirely worthless and should just die and decrease the surplus population.Loach is that kind of a filmmaker, a downbeat guy with a social conscience whose films deal with the hardships of working-class life. But there’s something about this movie that is very easy to take. It’s serious, but it’s not a downer, or at least it doesn’t feel that one. The lift comes from the casting of a comedian, Dave Johns, in the title role. Johns doesn’t make “I, Daniel Blake” into a laugh-a-minute or even a laugh-an-hour exercise. But he keeps things from getting unbearable with his lightness of being. He just doesn’t seem cut out for tragedy. This is a temporary situation, as he sees it. Obviously, someone will soon realize that he really can’t go back to work and that he needs a little help. It’s just a little hiccup that he has to call heartless bureaucrats and then wait on hold listening to Muzak for upward of two hours. But soon everything will be sorted out.This is the paradox of the movie: At least half the scenes are about frustrating and even maddening situations, not only maddening to poor Daniel, but maddening to anyone who watches, as in the audience. But the actual experience of “Daniel Blake” is not one of frustration. In fact, the film brings a kind of satisfaction, a sense of “Oh, good. Somebody is finally showing how horrible this is.”Johns is terrific, the heart and soul of the movie, playing the kind of guy that’s the heart and soul of any industrialized country on the planet. So this is the guy they want to throw on the garbage heap? This is the guy whose expendable? It’s enough to make you want to scream, except you don’t have to scream. Ken Loach does the screaming for you.",1
"White Material: Drama. Starring Isabelle Huppert and Christopher Lambert. Directed by Claire Denis. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) White Material, the latest from director Claire Denis, deals with the love and self-delusion of a white plantation owner who finds herself in the midst of a revolution in Africa.  The woman, a coffee grower, is played by Isabelle Huppert, who, dressed here in simple cotton knee-length dresses, looks from some angles as if she's 12 years old. Her physical vulnerability exists in nice counterpoint to her iron will. Anyone who has seen Huppert in other films may well expect her to be able to beat down the revolution by glaring at it - if she really has to, she might lift an eyebrow. But Denis has something else in mind, as she plays off our expectations and brings out notes of vulnerability to break the seemingly impassive surface of this most formidable of screen presences. Zigzagging back and forth across a short span of time, the movie presents us with Maria (Huppert), a French woman doing everything she can to harvest her crop as her unnamed African nation descends into chaos and medieval butchery. At first, her motives seem commercial. But gradually we come to realize that what we're really seeing is a woman struggling to hold on to the country, the home and the life she loves. Her self-delusion - that she belongs, that she is not regarded as just more white material - derives not from arrogance but desperation. Her husband (Christopher Lambert) can't tear her away, because he's no match for that love. Denis' viewpoint and sympathies are sophisticated, complex and humane. Her shots of African landscapes are beautifully composed, and yet even they seem to contain a threat, suggesting something hiding within that beauty or something merciless and inhuman about the beauty itself.  As for Huppert, this is one of three films in succession (the others are Home and The Seawall) in which she plays a strong woman threatened with the loss of everything. There's a softness at the core of these performances that's new, that suggests a world-class talent that's continuing to grow.  -- Advisory: This film contains grim violence - and the graphic results of violence.",1

Starring Jordin Sparks, Carmen Ejogo and Whitney Houston. Directed by Salim Akil. (PG-13. 116 minutes.)American Idol winner Jordin Sparks makes her movie debut in Sparkle, and just that much - that half sentence - will probably keep a number of people from reading what follows. But Sparkle was made by smart people who built on their star's strengths, accounted for her weaknesses and didn't lean on her to carry the whole picture. Sparks' strengths include not just a powerful voice but also a radiant niceness, and that becomes part of the story. Sparkle also has the advantage of the late Whitney Houston, who plays Sparks' mother. Inevitably, there are moments sprinkled throughout that will remind you of Houston's life and ultimate fate, as when Mom - a woman who almost made it as a singer - says that the music business almost killed her. But mostly it's just a pleasure to receive this unexpected gift, to hear Houston tear into a gospel number and to witness the maturity and the gravity that she brings to the role of a single mother raising three daughters.  Yet when all is said and done, I suspect that very few people will walk out of Sparkle talking about either Sparks or Houston, at least not at first. Instead they will be saying, Who was that? And they'll be referring to Carmen Ejogo, who plays Sparks' older sister. If there is any justice, Ejogo will become very famous very soon. As in, maybe today. It's rare to see someone become a movie star right before your eyes, but that's what happens with Ejogo in Sparkle. She has apparently been making feature films for 15 years, but always in small or smallish parts. Here she has what is nominally the supporting role, except that she sings a half dozen songs to Sparks' two, and her role is the focus of the drama. For an actress, this was the opportunity of a lifetime, and Ejogo plays it that way. She leaves nothing out, holds nothing back. Sparkle takes place in mid-'60s Detroit, where three daughters live in a house with their mother (Houston), a former wild woman who amended her ways to become a devout Christian. Sparkle (Sparks) is a natural songwriter but shy as a performer. Her older sister, known as Sister (Ejogo), back home following a divorce, is magnetic and sensuous onstage, and she has a voice, too. But she has never really gotten anywhere professionally. Meanwhile, the middle sister, Dolores (Tika Sumpter), is planning to go to medical school. An enterprising young man (Derek Luke), hoping to become the next Berry Gordy, gets the idea that the three sisters should form a girl group, and most of Sparkle tells the usual showbiz tale of trial and triumph. But mainly, Sparkle is the story of Sister - her hunger for security, her resentment of her mother, and her mix of brave and greedy impulses. With every other character in the film, you know who they are just by looking at them. Sister is the one to watch and wonder about. Make no mistake: Sparkle is heavy on the melodrama and hits every nasty landing on its way to the ground floor - the bad marriage, the drug problem, the violence and despair. But what distinguishes Sparkle and engages the emotions, even if we feel we've seen it all before, is director Salim Akil's investment in truth. When Sister, for example, leads a rehearsal while strung out on cocaine, Ejogo looks strung out - enough so that it's a disturbing sight.  Nothing in Sparkle stands in for something else. Everything is inhabited, so that grief looks like grief, a weary mother looks like a weary mother, and a bad husband is played - convincingly by Mike Epps - as a truly evil man. Sparkle was never going to be a masterpiece or anything close to it, but when a director gets everything out of a script, and more, that's notable.  It's even better when he leads a previously unappreciated performer to a supporting actress Oscar, and that might be what we're talking about here. Because when it comes down to it, Sparks makes Sparkle pleasant, and Houston makes it interesting. But it's only Carmen Ejogo who makes Sparkle genuinely worth seeing.",1
"Who Killed Bambi?: Thriller. Starring Sophie Quinton and Laurent Lucas. Directed by Gilles Marchand. (Not rated. 130 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The fear is loss of control. When people go into the hospital, they turn their lives over to doctors, nurses and surgeons. So wouldn't it be a creepy thing if there were a wacko surgeon going around in the dead of night, drugging the female patients so he might strip and fondle them when they're unconscious? The beauty of writer-director Gilles Marchand's characterization of the doctor, and of Laurent Lucas' performance, is that Dr. Philipp is a very recognizable medical type. He's a young surgeon, supremely confident, friendly but condescending, the kind of fellow who calls his patients by their first names but expects to be called doctor. In every other medical movie he'd be revealed to have a feeling soul underneath the stern professional exterior, and our heroine would marry him. In Who Killed Bambi? he's revealed within 10 minutes to be a menace. A student nurse, Isabelle (Sophie Quinton) is the only person onto him. At first, it's just a matter of intuition. Dr. Philipp and Isabelle share a wavelength. He is drawn to her, because he senses her fascination with him and enjoys needling her. (He nicknames her Bambi, because she has an inner-ear disorder that causes her to collapse periodically, particularly when the doctor is around.) In fact, she understands him better than he knows. She understands what drives him and can guess what he's been doing. When the hospital catches on that someone has been stealing anesthetic from a cabinet, it adopts a new rule that ensures that all bottles will be accounted for. Dr. Philipp, who goes through lots of anesthetic each night -- whose entire sex life depends on anesthetic -- circumvents this rule by filling syringes with anesthetic and replacing the fluid that's missing with non-anesthetic. This has a ghastly result -- patients start waking up during surgery. The audience is treated to a scene along those lines, rendered with cool, horrifying meticulousness. Who Killed Bambi? is not in the strictest sense realistic. Marchand takes the most common visual associations with hospitals and amplifies them. Everything is white and cold and so silent you can hear the lights buzzing. In reality, hospitals can be quite busy in the middle of the night, but here everyone is asleep and the floors are almost deserted. The hospital is so empty that most nights it seems there's only one doctor on duty in the entire building -- guess who? -- and only one nurse, a student. Marchand does something clever. He enhances the anxiety inherent in the story by playing to the audience's anxieties about hospitals in general. He gives us a hospital of paranoid fantasy, a kind of waiting room for death, and he sets the tone for this early. In the very first scene, student nurses are shown in a classroom learning how to break bad news to a family. The teacher is not big on euphemism. She gravitates to the word dead. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language, sexual situations, violence, full frontal nudity and disturbing scenes of surgery. ",1
"Who Killed the Electric Car?: Documentary. Directed by Chris Paine. (Not rated. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Who Killed the Electric Car? is a balanced examination of the reasons for the electric car's disappearance, reasons that include corporate collusion and greed, governmental spinelessness and oil company propaganda -- but also consumer indifference and the limitations of the vehicles themselves. Rather than try to devise a conspiracy theory that lays the blame on one party's doorstep, director Chris Paine examines the issue from a number of sides. He makes a virtue of the issue's complexity, by structuring the film as though it were a murder mystery with a host of suspects. In fact, he gives enough evidence for the viewer to come away with an understanding of the situation that's different from his own. Put it this way: Do you really need a conspiracy theory to figure out why people, in 1997, didn't run out to buy a $35,000 car that could only go, at most, 120 miles without a charge and that took at least 45 minutes to charge? Do you need a conspiracy theory to explain why an automotive company wouldn't want to throw good money after bad by strenuously advertising it? As it stood, General Motors' EV1 was a great car to have as a second vehicle, for city driving. But most people who spend 35 grand on a new car want that car to be their primary vehicle. They don't want to have to buy yet another car to drive into the country for the weekend. Yet explaining why few people bought the electric car in the beginning doesn't completely explain why it disappeared. Anyone who has been around long enough has seen the pattern repeated with VCRs, computers, video cameras and DVD players and recorders: The first entries onto the market are expensive, imperfect and not always easy to use. But over time, usually over a fairly short time, the bugs are worked out, the technology becomes more practical and the prices plummet. This is exactly what did not happen with electric cars, and the fact that it didn't happen -- that little effort was expended to make it happen -- is where the film's investigation proves fruitful. Rather than try to comply with California's emissions timetable by investing further in electric car technology, the automobile companies made it their mission to overturn the law. GM halted its production of the EV1 and then -- as if to erase the electric car from memory -- refused to let leaseholders buy the cars. Instead, as the leases ran out, GM took the cars back and destroyed them. Meanwhile, oil companies ran ads claiming that the electric car was an environmental hazard. Later, they bought the rights to the electric car battery technology. Who Killed the Electric Car? makes a compelling case that the current discussion of hydrogen cell technology, as the successor to the internal combustion engine, is a way of keeping America hooked on gasoline for at least 20 more years. The hydrogen cell is decades away, while the electric car is close to being practical. The one bright spot is the popularity of hybrid vehicles. If there's a conspiracy against the Prius, someone forgot to tell the consumer. ",1
"With Iran in the news, the timing of “Desert Dancer” couldn’t be better. The real-life story of a young man who started an underground dance troupe, despite dancing being forbidden in the Islamic republic, the film is also an extended look into how people live in Iran, and how they feel about it.The human need for self-expression is at the heart of this film. What a strange thing, that as soon as you take away a people’s ability to express themselves, they suddenly have something to say. In the West, we can express ourselves all day long, but most of our art is trivial. But when people have to risk their lives to say something, all the force of their creativity lasers in on the essential. Afshin Ghaffarian (Reece Ritchie) starts life as a dance natural, as if his mind and body were programmed for that destiny. As a child, he studies at an underground school, and when he goes to college in Tehran, he falls in with a group of like-minded students. According to “Desert Dancer,” there’s a public Iran, with morality-enforcing thugs harassing people into conformity. And then there is the private Iran of drinking, dancing and secret nightclubs. For a hedonist with no higher ambition, the ability to blow off steam in a private club would be enough. But Afshin is an artist and, even more difficult, an artist whose art can’t really exist without the sounding board of an audience. He starts a clandestine dance company but very soon realizes that they will have nothing if they never get a chance to perform. On the other hand, if word gets out to the wrong people — and the wrong people are everywhere and have big ears — they could be imprisoned, tortured or killed.In “Desert Dancer,” we see the impact of things we take for granted, as when Afshin gets hold of an unblocked Internet server and looks up various dancers on YouTube. YouTube, in effect, becomes his choreographer. The preciousness of art, what that communication across time and space means in people’s lives, is something we never forget while watching “Desert Dancer.” At one point, Afshin becomes rapt by the sight of black-and-white ballet footage of Rudolf Nureyev, and through Afshin, we experience the same fascination.Freida Pinto co-stars as Elaheh, a gifted, troubled woman who joins Afshin’s company. Though the film is based on true events, one suspects that Elaheh is a creation of the screenplay. If so, screenwriter Jon Croker should be congratulated. Elaheh is the tortured soul of the country, the talented daughter of a ballerina whose career ended with the Islamic revolution. Pinto, whose roles have too often been antiseptic, is affecting as a woman whose passionate drive for life is matched by her impulse toward self-destruction.Movies about people trying to start dance companies tend to be as formulaic as sports movies, but “Desert Dancer” escapes the usual drawbacks — corniness and bad dancing — by the urgency of the context. To watch it is to ask what you might do under similar circumstances. It’s to contemplate the tremendous fear at the core of government thugs everywhere, and it’s to wonder about Iran’s future.In the end, it’s hard to know whether to see the Iran of “Desert Dancer” in optimistic or pessimistic terms. Young people, especially, want to be free, but the other side has all the power. Having YouTube on your side certainly helps, but an army and some tanks can come in handy, too. ",1
"With Steven Spielberg, everything is always just a little bit better. There’s an atmosphere of enchantment about “The BFG” that is not imposed by the soundtrack or jolted into artificial life by overdone close-ups and exaggerated performances. Rather it’s the product of an investment in every aspect of every frame, guided by an inspired and thorough vision of what the movie must be.Based on the 1982 children’s novel by Roald Dahl, “The BFG” lacks some of the emotional depths we find in the best Spielberg movies, and, though it fully recovers well before the finish, it has a distinct sag in its middle. Still, this is one of the standout movies of the season, combining some lovely acting with extraordinary special effects.It’s a funny thing. You can see a thousand movies and think that you’ve become immune to dazzling visuals — until you see them done right. With most CGI-heavy films, the artistry hasn’t caught up with the possibilities. Not here. Spielberg knows that being able to show a giant hand scooping a little girl out of her bed is only half the challenge. Figuring out a way to do it so that the audience feels awed and amazed is in the realm of art. It’s not enough that things happen. How they happen is all-important.And so a simple scene in which an 11-year-old girl stands on the kitchen counter of a giant as he makes his dinner becomes a joy to watch because of all the imaginative ways in which the scene is staged. She sits in a metal bowl, and as he pounds away on a cutting board, the bowl starts to shake and revolve. And because this is Spielberg, who is always attentive to his actors, the human aspect is never lost in such moments. So it’s not just a bowl spinning with someone inside it, but a bowl spinning with a specific person inside it, reacting in a distinct way.The girl in the bowl, Sophie, is played by Ruby Barnhill, who is as much of a find as Drew Barrymore was in Spielberg’s “E.T.” She has a face that could only be English and a quality of intelligence that makes her seem like a 35-year-old stuck in a child’s body. Sophie is a child in an orphanage, but as soon as we see her, we recognize her as a great soul just waiting for the freedom of adulthood — or for the adventure that comes with being in a children’s story.Sophie is such an active intelligence that she is already an insomniac, and so she is the one person awake to see the B(ig) F(riendly) G(iant) (Mark Rylance) skulking in his black cape, towering over the low buildings of London. When he sees her, of course, he plucks her out of her bed and takes her with him, because he doesn’t want her telling everyone of his existence. As if anyone would believe her. Like the best of children’s stories, it takes place in a world that swings between kindness and cruelty. The BFG  is gentle and thoughtful, but there are other giants — bigger, nastier ones — whose favorite thing in life is to eat children. The BFG is virtually defenseless against them, and, what’s even worse, these evil giants can smell children when they’re in the vicinity.This is an altogether depressing situation, and in that middle section, it appears the story may become just about a girl talking to a friendly giant, in between interludes in which bad giants barge in and knock over all the furniture. Leavening some of that misery is a trip that Sophie and BFG take to a dream world — the BFG’s life work is to capture people’s dreams and sometimes to craft and instill them. It’s easy to imagine Rylance, with his distant, dreamy quality, doing just that, or even to see his acting as its real-world equivalent. But even then, for a short but notable period, the film becomes sluggish, and the dream element seems merely a bit of extraneous fancy.In fact, this is not the case, and in the last 40 minutes of “The BFG,” the palette brightens and all the elements come together. The movie becomes inventive in new ways and even cheery. It’s a true delight. ",1
"With most movies, we know the basic shape of the story within 15 minutes. If it’s a romantic comedy, we can figure how it’s going to end before we even sit down. If it’s a horror movie, we can pretty much guess not only which characters get killed, but the order in which they’re killed — just as we know that in action movies, the worst villain always dies last and in spectacular fashion.So when a movie comes along that is so peculiar that it’s impossible to outguess, one that flows naturally and inevitably from scene to scene but always seems capable of going just about anywhere at any time, it’s a real pleasure. “Colossal” expands where other movies contract. Two-thirds of the way in, when other movies are slowing down for the finish, “Colossal” gets weirder and more free form. It’s surprising that people actually put up the money to make this movie — surprising and reassuring. Written and directed by the Spanish filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo, it’s the story of a young woman, Gloria (Anne Hathaway), who is a complete mess. She’s a burgeoning alcoholic and can’t hold down a job, and as the film begins, her boyfriend (Dan Stevens) is dumping her. This forces her to move back to a vacant house owned by her family in her hometown.While she’s there, back to carousing with drinking buddies old and new, a horrible event starts dominating cable news: An enormous monster is menacing Seoul. Very quickly, Gloria figures out that the monster’s rampages tend to occur during periods in which she blacks out from drinking. She also notices, while watching the live news coverage, that if she moves her arm, the monster does, too. If she dances, so does the monster. And this is precisely where 99 out of a 100 screenwriters would have started to screw things up: You get a great crazy idea. So what do you do with it? What most writers reflexively do is try to make sense of the craziness. They paddle for the safe and respectable shores of metaphor, so that the monster would become a symbol for Gloria’s alcoholism and, by extension, for the monster within us all. From there, it would be only a matter of filling in the blanks of Gloria’s recovery story. Fortunately, Vigalondo doesn’t do that. He gets one crazy idea, and that’s just a warm-up for his second crazy idea, and then his third, and his fourth. In this way, “Colossal” becomes not just a good movie but a creative writing lesson. Instead of retreating into metaphor, Vigalondo expands into imagination, with faith that somehow he’ll make it all work and that the audience will stay with him. On both counts, his faith pays off. Vigalondo helps himself by grounding “Colossal” in a distinct tone that is comic but never safe, allowing for the possibility of genuine menace. And Hathaway hits that tone just right, playing Gloria as someone who has been out of it for so much of her life that the monster connection, while something awful, doesn’t quite register as preposterous or entirely unexpected. It’s just a particularly vivid misery in a succession of less colorful misfortunes. Vigalondo grounds the film further by concentrating on a handful of characters in a blighted small town, one of those chronically underemployed, depressed places that the media runs to whenever they want to find Trump voters. Jason Sudeikis is Oscar, the owner of the local nightclub and the leader of a group of drunks who hang out drinking beer until the sun comes up. Sudeikis is interesting here, sunny and genial but self-hating, and Tim Blake Nelson finds a nice quality as one of the regulars, surface stupidity but an intelligent person’s sorrow. “Colossal” is a high-wire act, and throughout you may wonder how the movie will make it to the end without slipping and falling. Suffice it to say, it does. It doesn’t ascend to the sky. It’s not profound or great. But Vigalondo takes “Colossal” to all sorts of unexpected places and then brings it home, intact. ",1
"With the release of “Command and Control,” we may have to amend our Cold War history and say that the closest we ever came to blowing up wasn’t the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. It was 18 years later, on Sept. 18, 1980, when a maintenance worker at a nuclear facility in Damascus, Ark., accidentally dropped a socket that punctured a Titan II missile.That feels about right, doesn’t it? When the world comes to an end, maybe it won’t be a drama. Maybe it will be a farce. I was alive in 1980, just minding my business like everybody else, and I had no idea how close I came to blowing up (and I was hundreds of miles away). The details, suppressed for years, were revealed in Eric Schlosser’s book of the same name, and that book is now a documentary by Robert Kenner.Here’s the takeaway: You know all those studies that say you are more likely to get shot if you have a gun in your house? Well, apparently, those studies have a nuclear analogue: If you have nuclear weapons, you have a better chance of one detonating on your own soil than if you don’t have them. And no matter the safety precautions, there’s always a chance of something going grossly, insanely, horribly, farcically, tragically and disastrously wrong.Here’s one near-disaster from the early 1960s that the movie reveals: Apparently a plane loaded with a nuclear bomb was flying over North Carolina when it experienced engine difficulty and started to break up. As the plane came apart, something hit the nuclear missile that triggered it to go through all the stages of arming. There’s only one reason it didn’t go off and take out the entire Southeast. (Get ready for this one.) The on/off switch was in the off position! Good thing it didn’t hit a tree along the way. Or land upside down.The 1980 Damascus incident began with routine maintenance, done by a crew of guys who looked barely old enough to shave. When the lug made the puncture, the team was afraid to mention it. Precious time was lost. The rest of the film details the effort to keep that thing from blowing up. But the interesting detail is that they didn’t succeed, exactly. They just got lucky.We go through life worrying about things that never happen, and sometimes we feel as if it’s only our paranoid vigilance that keeps the bad events from taking place. Well, see “Command and Control” and you’ll have a brand-new thing to worry about. As a child, I worried about nuclear war. It never occurred to me that I should have been worried about a nuclear accident. Here’s something else to consider: At least when it’s an international crisis, you have some of the best minds trying to prevent catastrophe. During the Cuban missile crisis, we had Jack and Bobby Kennedy, along with a team of intelligent diplomats and borderline crazy generals. But working for us on Sept. 18, 1980, we had a team of fuzzy-cheeked kids in HazMat suits, feeling their way in the dark.It’s a weird thing to realize: You’ve spent your life worrying about the wrong thing.",1
"With “Band Aid,” it’s time to get interested in Zoe Lister-Jones. She has been on the fringes of the movie business for several years now, starring in a couple of low-budget films that she has written, while enjoying more mainstream success on TV as a regular on the show “Life in Pieces.” “Band Aid” is her first film as a director — she also wrote and stars in it — and something about her and this film is really appealing.“Band Aid” is the portrait of a marriage, and between the frames, it’s emblematic of a certain type of person in this particular cultural and economic moment. The husband and wife here are young but not so young that they’re not worried about the future. They are in their 30s and of an artistic bent, each having almost succeeded in becoming successful in the arts. But now they’re working in jobs they don’t like, in the “gig economy,” which is not all that it’s cracked up to be.To add to their troubles, they’re coping with the aftermath of a miscarriage, which seems to have devastated them, so that now they keep getting into arguments about stupid things. They associate each other with stress and jump on every chance to gain the advantage. Lister-Jones has a light touch with this, and the script has wit. But the audience is aware that they’re seeing something serious, that these are people in love whose marriage is circling the drain.Lister-Jones is really good at capturing the dynamic of marital arguments, how they blow up without warning and can subside just as quickly, though the latter usually takes an act of will. Anna (Lister-Jones) and Ben (Adam Pally) don’t just argue, they also argue about how the other argues, telling each other what they have and don’t have the right to say. It’s like watching the futility of intelligence in action. Their gifts are doing neither of them any good, not in the world and not in their home. Though Ben and Anna share the spotlight, the film’s emotional locus is Anna, who, of the two, is the most troubled and dissatisfied and is the most in touch with her grief and disappointment. Lister-Jones has no trouble placing herself at the center. If you didn’t know going in, you wouldn’t guess that this is someone directing herself. There are no self-indulgent scenes of wistful contemplation. “Band Aid” is a clear-eyed movie about a clear-eyed woman trying to break through her malaise through decisive action.The action in this case is to start a band. As a way of solving two problems at once — their artistic stagnation and their marital discord — they start turning their arguments into songs. This results in some clever creations, including a bizarre, chipper love song in which the two sing about how much they don’t want to have sex with each other.The decision to form a band comes early in the film, and everything that happens follows from there. “Band Aid” is not without slow spots, and in a sense the story suffers from Lister-Jones’ integrity: The movie remains realistic, not a fairy tale. Still Lister-Jones makes us believe in this couple, keeps us interested in their lives and keeps us thinking about other people like them.",1
"Woody Allen has made so many great and near-great movies that every new release begins with an audience wondering — is this going to be another one? Usually, within about 15 minutes, the answer is apparent, and usually the answer is no. That’s how it works, even with the best. Babe Ruth hit a lot of home runs, but most of the time he made an out, and when he did get a hit, it was usually a single.Allen’s latest, “Wonder Wheel” is a single — or maybe it’s a single stretched to a double on the basis of some fancy base running (acting) by Kate Winslet. In almost any other filmmaker’s oeuvre, this film would be considered a highlight. But for the director who made “Hannah and Her Sisters,” “Match Point” and “Blue Jasmine”? It’s right up there with “Melinda and Melinda” and “Scoop.” Good, not great.It takes place in the Coney Island of the 1950s, a colorful place made yet more colorful through Vittorio Storaro’s nostalgic cinematography. The amusement park has seen better days, but it’s still a place of working-class dreams, where average people can buy thrills and laughs with just the change in their pockets. Juno Temple enters the scene, in a pretty dress, looking the embodiment of 1950s young womanhood. She is trying to find her father, who works running one of the rides.In order to enjoy “Wonder Wheel,” it is necessary for the audience to accept a convenience of the plot that doesn’t make much sense: Carolina (Temple) has left her mobster husband and has told her story to the FBI. Now she’s a marked woman. So what does she do? She decides to go stay with her father (Jim Belushi) and stepmother, Ginny (Kate Winslet) at their place in Coney Island. This is the first place that gangsters would look.Even worse, with the approval of her family, she takes a waitress job in a restaurant, where anyone might recognize her. Obviously, there are entire packs of lemmings with better survival instincts than the people in this movie.Temple is more adult and aware here than elsewhere, as radiant and idiosyncratic as a studio-age star. Yet despite the drama surrounding her character, “Wonder Wheel” is really the story of Ginny, who is desperate for love and security and has given up on her explosive, alcoholic husband. On the beach one day, she meets a lifeguard, Mickey (Justin Timberlake), and they start an affair.Woody Allen is perhaps better than any other American filmmaker at depicting the gradual process by which love can go from idyllic to hellish. He also has a way of finding grand moral issues — the matters of conscience that define entire lives — through seemingly small events. Like so many of Allen’s movies, “Wonder Wheel” traces the moral journey of a sympathetic character, who deserves everything she wants. But as beautifully played by Winset, she wants it too much.Timberlake is interesting here, in that he is very good at the moment-to-moment emotions, and yet there is something faintly artificial about his performance, overall. Then again, there is something artificial, or at least heightened and operatic, about the entire movie — the sets, the colors, the situations, the performers. Belushi takes it way over the top as the alcoholic husband and father, as abandoned and fascinating as an understudy tenor finally getting to go on in “Pagliacci.” Yet, like Timberlake, there is something true at the core of what he’s doing.If there’s a weakness to “Wonder Wheel,” it’s that, in the end, all the bigness and bluster don’t land with an impression of importance. Things happen in the lives of these people, and we watch, and we understand that it’s all a very big deal — for them, not us. All the same, “Wonder Wheel” engages our attention from beginning to end.",1
"World War I remains the disaster the world has never completely digested, because, like the Wicked Witch of the East, it was followed by something even worse. But for Great Britain and France, its death toll was greater than that of World War II, involving the decimation of a generation of young men.“Testament of Youth” dramatizes a war memoir that’s not from the usual angle. Based on the book of the same name by feminist author Vera Brittain, it tells the story of World War I from the viewpoint of a young, upper-middle-class British woman who had friends, family and a fiance fighting on the front lines. Though it had been the ambition of her life to study at Oxford, Brittain left school within months of enrolling to take a job nursing the wounded.By 1914, the 20th century had yet to show its true colors, but then it did, all at once, with a ferocity that must have astounded people. As “Testament of Youth” begins, Vera (Swedish actress Alicia Vikander) and her friends have no conception that their lives are about to be upended. In the summer of 1914, they’re swimming in the pond, strolling through the countryside and dreading nothing more terrible than the start of school. Then the war erupts, and the men start enlisting.World War I — or the Great War, as it was known for more than 20 years — marks what will probably stand as the last time anyone could be fooled into thinking of war as a noble and glorious undertaking. The men sign up in a sporting spirit, or at least to avoid ridicule. In the case of Vera’s genial younger brother (Taron Egerton),  Vera must intervene with her father to allow the boy to go. In her mind, and his, she is doing him a favor.As Vera, Vikander is virtually in every scene, the eyes, ears and conscience of the film. When we meet her, Vera is already angry, that her father won’t pay for her education (but will pay for her brother’s), and everything that happens subsequently only confirms in her the sense that men are running the world into the ground. “Testament of Youth” demands that an actress convey a fierce intelligence, an ever-deepening understanding and a depthless sorrow, lest the story have no impact or meaning. She also must show the openness of youth, a willingness to hope and be happy, because this is not a movie about a scold. Vikander accomplishes all this, often in close-up, for director James Kent’s searching camera.That it’s not a fiction but based on a memoir allows for some unexpected scenes, as the truth is often more extreme than the things we imagine. There’s a brilliant sequence in which Vera’s boyfriend (Kit Harington),  a fellow would-be writer, returns home for a few days, after months at the front, and he acts scornful and indifferent toward her. After months of waiting and worrying, she is almost crushed, until she has the insight that she represents emotion to him. She understands that he fears opening himself up to all that feeling, and yet he must or else he’ll lose himself.When it was published in 1933, Brittain’s “Testament of Youth” was a best-seller. Timing is everything in the book world, and the memoir arrived just as intelligent people were beginning to dread and fear a second world war. To see this film is to understand — not in an intellectual way, but in a direct, visceral way — why the British ignored the threat of Adolf Hitler for so long.In World War I, a generation learned that war was not the answer. In World War II, another generation learned that pacifism was not the answer. It would seem that there just isn’t an answer.",1
"Written and directed by Scott Roberts, the picture seems the conscious product of a filmmaker's decision not to let any moment be merely functional. A scene in which three brothers, newly released from prison, order breakfast in a restaurant is a good early example. Roberts uses the scene to demonstrate the discipline of Dale (Guy Pearce), the gentleness of Mal (Damien Richardson) and the perpetual turmoil surrounding Shane (Joel Edgerton). Their contact with the waitress is funny and also tense. Nothing bad happens, but it feels as though it might. Roberts knows how to keep an audience interested. The three brothers are professional armed robbers, whose one rule is never to hurt anybody. They're hooked up with a sleazy lawyer (Robert Taylor), who has no rules -- he's just a self-interested creep, who is having an affair with Dale's wife (Rachel Griffiths). Some of the best scenes have to do with the affair. In one, Dale looks over at his wife and his lawyer, and the light almost dawns in his eyes. It's better than seeing a complete realization. The usually dark-haired Griffiths sports the bleached blond hair of a 1940s femme fatale here, a look that goes to the edge of parody, as does the film in general. The thieves are truehearted, and the lawyer is diabolical. Out of these conflicting characters and interests, Roberts devises a story in which the fellows decide to do one last job with the lawyer -- who meanwhile has decided that this will be their last job, period. Nothing new or earthshaking here, but The Hard Word is tense and compelling, with the added charm of a mischievous spirit. . This film contains strong language, sexual situations and graphic violence. -- Mick LaSalle Drama. Starring Paul Bettany, Helena Bonham Carter, Olivia Williams. Directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan. (Not rated. 96 minutes. At the Opera Plaza). . Watching The Heart of Me, it's tempting to imagine what might have been had the female roles been reversed -- if Helena Bonham Carter played the 1930s British society wife and coolly beautiful Olivia Williams the bohemian sister/home wrecker. But current cinema dictates that Bonham Carter (Wings of the Dove, Fight Club) play fire-within, offbeat women, and she does so again here, brown eyes blazing at society's constraints. She's good at it, which is no surprise. Nor is anything else in this well- acted but rote drama better suited for British television than theaters. That each of the characters is to some degree duplicitous adds intrigue but also robs the audience of having anybody to root for. But Paul Bettany, an actor best known for bouncy comedic turns (A Beautiful Mind) certainly makes a case for his conflicted philanderer. Bettany emits a low rumble of contempt for this guy's gilded life, and a palpable yearning for his sister-in-law, whose family wants to marry her off to a stiff. In the film's most powerful scene, Bettany, heretofore perfectly mannered, spits to Bonham Carter, You will not go through with this! and she nods silently, delighted to have the lord of the manor take charge. Williams (The Sixth Sense) has less to work with, but her performance hints at the toll of maintaining appearances no matter what. She's particularly good in scenes with Bonham Carter, indicating a lifetime of suffering inflicted by this unconventional sibling, a burden even before she stole her husband. The great pleasure in these kinds of pictures is the period detail, the burnished dinner parties and elegant parlors. Director Thaddeus O'Sullivan captures this aspect especially well in a scene where Bettany and Williams, clad in formal wear, converse while admiring their swank coupledom in the mirror. The moment reveals the vain pretense of their marriage and foreshadows turmoil. Unfortunately, that turmoil becomes increasingly repetitive as convention conspires to keep the lovers apart. The key to movies like this is what goes unsaid, but too much gets left out here, at the expense of character. We never find out, for instance, why Bonham Carter's character would betray her sister in such a way. And if she's truly a '30s libertine, wouldn't she have strayed a little farther than her conservative brother-in-law? After all, Paris was just a boat trip away. . This film contains strong sexuality, nudity. -- Carla Meyer Internet sex and romance. Starring Josh Hamilton, Harold Perrineau, John Fleck and Vanessa Ferlito. Directed by Jed Weintrob. Written by Andrew Osborne and Jed Weintrob. (R. 87 minutes. At the Galaxy.) . Listless, self-absorbed slackers stare into computer monitors, groan about their lives and moan during cyber sex in On_Line. It makes you wonder, is there is a market for soft-porn movies for lonely geeks? Isn't that what computers are for in the first place? John (Josh Hamilton, The House of Yes) and Mo (Harold Perrineau, The Matrix Reloaded), former college roomies, run a live erotic Web site called Intercon-X. The kicker is that everyone is streaming video through digital cameras on their computers. Not only do they link up with live sex workers who fake orgasms (sex has rarely seemed so joyless and antiseptic), but they also chat online with their video faces filling the other person's computer screen. The sight of the characters, walking around their barren apartments, holding a Webcam up to their noses like a mirror, tells you everything about these losers. It is all about them. Especially John, who takes dazed and confused to a whole new level. Tippling peppermint schnapps and droning into his video journal about his sad, dreary life, John can't bring himself to shave, change clothes or keep his mouth from hanging open. Or maybe he could if he didn't keep getting distracted by another Web site and continuing his masturbation marathon. He has that in common with everyone else in the movie. This is a group of people who never pass up a chance for some zipper diving. At least they are doing it with someone they love. - This film contains graphic sex, profanity, drugs and violence. -- C.W. Nevius ",1
"XXX: Action. Starring Vin Diesel and Asia Argento. Directed by Rob Cohen. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) So what? Roadrunner was a good cartoon, and the other stuff hardly matters in a movie like this. In terms of adrenaline, XXX is one of the most satisfying entries this summer. Everything about the picture is fun, including the things wrong with it. Its scale and audacity, its brashness and vulgarity make it a pleasure from beginning to end -- or a guilty pleasure for those prone to guilt. Director Rob Cohen films it with a vigorousness bordering on aggression. Best of all, there's newly anointed action star Vin Diesel, who brings to the screen something that just feels new. It has taken until August 2002, but now we know what 21st century cool looks like. It sounds like a silly thing -- it is a silly thing -- and yet it's refreshing. Pumped up, tattooed (at least here) and sporting that most basic of hairstyles, the shaved head, Diesel is a modern-looking fellow that we know we've seen, but never fronting a movie. He brings with him a whiff of youth culture, while embodying the right action-movie virtues: cynicism, poise and a wise mouth. Diesel plays Xander Cage, an extreme sports/video artist/career criminal who lives for thrills. In his first scene, he steals a Corvette from an obnoxious politician, drives it off a bridge and parachutes into the passenger seat of his getaway car. All the while, the video cameras are turning. Cohen, as he did in The Fast and the Furious, creates a subculture around Diesel. In The Fast and the Furious, the subculture was based on street racing. Here it's based on extreme sports, and yet the worlds of the two movies are almost identical. No one works, and everyone lives in a big house, partying, fighting and having sex. Just imagine the effect such a fantasy vision of adulthood could have on the teenage mind. The plot soon intrudes to yank Xander out of his cozy setup. Samuel L. Jackson, in his first go-around as an aging mentor, plays Agent Gibbons, who uses coercion to enlist Xander as a secret agent. Apparently something is going on in Prague, and whatever it is, it's bad. America's previous agents have been getting killed trying to find out, but Gibbons figures that a lowlife like Xander will have no trouble infiltrating the Czech criminal underground. Jackson goes through the movie with a big, ugly acid scar covering almost half of his face. It's there for no discernible reason, except perhaps to give Diesel a chance to call him Handsome and Scarface. He does it well. The thing that's valuable about Diesel as a star is that his reasonable- wild-man persona is so flexible. Put him in the most extreme situation, and he not only fits right in but also grounds the situation in his own hyper-reality. The secret-agent training scenes would be a joke with any other actor. Here they're not quite a joke. We see our hero being pulled from a moving airplane, and seconds before impact he shouts, I live for this! The Prague underworld is not unlike the one Xander left at home. A criminal mastermind named Yorgi (Marton Csokas) leads a gang of black marketeers, which includes the sullen Yelena, played by Italian actress Asia Argento. Here, again, everyone lives in a big house in which the men act like drunken Vikings in a Hollywood epic and the women slither around waiting for someone to end their longing. It looks, actually, like an ideal place for Xander to spend a vacation, so it's too bad that, for all his virtues as a host, Yorgi is also a sadistic homicidal maniac. Prague has been getting a workout in movies lately. The Bourne Identity was partly shot there, and so was Bad Company, that bomb starring Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins. But here we get to see workaday Prague as a vibrant city, and the effect is striking. XXX should do wonders for the city's tourist industry. The screenplay concocts a romance for Xander and Yelena, but the scenes ring hollow -- they should not have even bothered faking it. XXX is much more about spectacle, the bigger the better. We see Diesel riding a motorcycle through the crack in a barbed-wire fence. We see him skateboarding on a metal tray down a bannister. My favorite is when he snowboards ahead of an avalanche -- an avalanche of his own making. It's all unbelievable, but then, we're not supposed to believe it; nor are we expected to accept these scenes in a kind of James Bond spirit of parody. These scenes are there for only one reason, to make us say wow. Wow. This film contains violence and sexual situations. ",1
"Yet by persisting, she soon finds herself in the position to act as an intermediary between the IRA and the British government. What's splendid about Walters is that she resists all temptation to condescend to Bernie, to make her a cute charac ter. Bernie is a rather simple person, but Walters never comments on her simplicity. Walters also lets us see Bernie's ego, which blossoms under the media spotlight. Directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill), the film is based on an autobiographical novel by Mary Costello, whose mother was the inspiration for Bernie. The film also follows Bernie's 16-year-old daughter, Annie (Nuala O'Neill), tracing her blossoming first romance with a young medical student. The '70s setting and the intercutting between the teenagers and the adults make Titanic Town a sort of Northern Ireland version of The Ice Storm. There are no key parties in this one, however. This is a tense, intelligent and sober film. -- Advisory: This film contains strong language and graphic violence. Mick LaSalle  THE BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK Documentary. Directed by Aiyana Elliott. (Not rated. 105 minutes. At the Shattuck in Berkeley, Rafael Film Center in San Rafael and Camera 3 in San Jose.) The film's subject has been searching his whole life. Born Elliott Adnopoz in Brooklyn in 1931, he transformed himself into Ramblin' Jack, a storytellin', guitar-pickin' troubadour who never met a ride -- by truck, train, boat -- he didn't take. This agreeable documentary, made by Elliott's only child, Aiyana Elliott, splits its time between straight biography (concert footage, interviews with colleagues and family members) and the filmmaker's efforts to get her elusive, wayward father to discuss their relationship. Awkward as the mix might sound, the film ends up musing perceptively on the American dream of wanderlust and its unintended consequences. As a young man in New York, Elliott befriended Woody Guthrie, who was already suffering from Huntington's chorea, the neurological disease that would eventually kill him. The young folksinger traveled to England, where he taught a budding generation of rock 'n' rollers how to affect the Wild West style. In the early 1960s, Elliott's influence on the Greenwich Village folk scene was considerable, if short- lived. Bob Dylan's first gig, at Gerde's Folk City, billed him as the Son of Jack Elliott. But Elliott never had much commercial success. Instead, he traveled the country, occasionally surfacing to accept performing invitations from friends such as Kris Kristofferson and Johnny Cash. (There's some wonderful footage, circa 1970, of the psychedelic cowboy appearing on Cash's network television program.) Scenes of the filmmaker trying to get her father, now 69, to sit still long enough for an in-depth interview are a little uncomfortable to watch. They're intended to be; it's clear that Aiyana believed this might be her last chance to get her dad's attention. Elliott's reluctance to have a heart-to-heart on camera -- he gets spacey, he gets grumpy -- is comical. The emotional estrangement it suggests is not. The life of the stage, of course, is notoriously tough on families. Arlo Guthrie, Woody's son, finds himself frustrated by Aiyana's rising anxiety about what makes her father tick. Maybe you're not supposed to know, he blurts. The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack is a swell, entertaining documentary of a nearly overlooked American performer. More than that, though, it's a thoughtful piece of work about parents and their children. -- Advisory: This film contains raw language. James Sullivan WILDFLOWERS  Drama. Starring Clea DuVall, Daryl Hannah, Tomas Arana, Eric Roberts, Richard Hillman, Eric Yetter and Robert Hass. Directed by Melissa Painter. (Not rated. 91 minutes. At the Rafael Film Center.) Wildflowers stars Clea DuVall (But I'm a Cheerleader); Daryl Hannah, who is also the film's exec utive producer; Tomas Arana; and Eric Roberts. Bay Area poet Robert Hass, the former U.S. poet laureate, is also featured -- as a poet. The film, shot in 21 days in Marin County and San Francisco, was written and directed by Melissa Painter of Sonoma. She's a New York University film school graduate who grew up in Mill Valley and obviously had her heart in this story of a 17- year-old girl named Cally (DuVall) who lives with her single dad (Arana) in the funky Sausalito houseboat community. Cally is a product of the extended Summer of Love, and she isn't sure who her mother is -- her father has refused to talk about the woman. Wildflowers is set in 1985. The tough-minded but searching girl often hangs around in Bolinas and in San Francisco's North Beach, where she takes an interest in tracking a mysterious hippie artist, Sabine (Hannah), with whom she is inexplicably fascinated. Cally soon grows obsessed with Sabine, and eventually their fitful relationship leads to a touching rite of passage. The film is beautifully photographed, to be sure (Paul Ryan is credited as director of photogra phy). Bolinas, Mount Tamalpais, North Beach and Sausalito's Gate 6 are luminous backdrops for the story. In this film, they appear to have changed little since the 1980s. Roberts, in fine form, plays a randy-looking North Beach drug dealer, a link between Cally and Sabine. No doubt there is a meaty movie to be made about the kids born dur ing the hippie revolution of the 1960s -- kids who often had to play parents to their own messed-up parents -- but this is not quite it. Wildflowers could have used more dramatic energy, maybe at the expense of some of that gorgeous scenery. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity and strong language. Peter Stack CRIMINAL LOVERS Modern fairy tale. Starring Natacha Regnier, Jeremie Renier and Miki Manojlovic. Directed by Francois Ozon. (Not rated. In French with English subtitles. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Bondage, female and male rape, murder and cannibalism all figure in this dispassionately observed tale of a 17-year-old sexual hysteric and her not completely compliant young lover. He escapes with her deep into the forest, where he discovers a mysterious woodsman and something hidden about himself as well. The surface of Ozon's film, set among high school students in a suburban French town, is cold and hard but carries an erotic charge. As it begins, Alice (Natacha Regnier) teases her blindfolded boyfriend Luc (Jeremie Renier) in an attempt to arouse him. She will then test him by asking him to kill for her. In the dark forest where they have fled, Luc frees a trapped rabbit. Soon he will become one himself. A scruffy woodsman (Miki Manojlovic) tosses Alice in the cellar and fattens up Luc. I like my girls dry, but I like my boys nice and plump, he says. D.H. Lawrence, meet Hannibal Lecter. -- Advisory: This film contains nudity, explicit sex and violence. Bob Graham .. ",1
"and Stuart Wilson. Directed by Roman Polanski. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Dramatically the film also hangs on the power of nagging questions. The audience wonders in the beginning if Paulina (Weaver) is crazy or just upset, the victim or victimizer. Later it wonders -- and continues wondering until the last minutes of the film -- whether mild-mannered Dr. Miranda is indeed, as Paulina believes, the man who raped her. Miranda is played by Ben Kingsley in what is probably the best film opportunity he has had since Gandhi. Kingsley, as well as director Roman Polanski, keeps us in the dark about Miranda's guilt or innocence. His performance is by no means coy -- it's not a series of feints in one direction and then another. It's true and complex and makes sense from every angle. The picture, which opens today, is based on the award-winning play by Ariel Dorfman, a Chilean forced into exile after the overthrow of Salvador Allende in 1973. Death and the Maiden takes place in an unnamed Latin American country, in the aftermath of the nation's return to democracy. Unlike other cinematic adaptations, Death and the Maiden's director doesn't hide the fact that the film is based on a play. Director Polanski and co-screenwriters Dorfman and Rafael Yglesias don't Sigourney Weaver, Stuart Wilson (rear) and Ben Kingsley in 'Death and the Maiden' attempt to open up the picture but instead lean on the material's inherent compression and claustrophobia to build a strained, unsettling atmosphere. The action of Death and the Maiden takes place over the course of a single night in a small house out in the woods. Stuart Wilson plays Escobar, an ambitious lawyer and former revolutionary who is now the new administration's investigator into the previous regime's crimes. He and his wife, Pauline (Weaver), are visited by a man who comes to return a spare tire to Escobar: Miranda. Listening from the next room, Paulina thinks she recognizes the voice of the man who raped and tortured her years before while she was bound and blindfolded. From here, Death and the Maiden becomes a taut revenge drama, with Paulina binding and gag ging Miranda and announcing that she is putting him on trial, with herself as judge and executioner. The set-up is similar to William Mastrosimone's play Extremities, with the all-important difference being that we don't know if the accused is guilty or not. The film manipulates the audience into actively rooting for Miranda's innocence, if only because Paulina is thoroughly unappealing. Then again, a history of having been tortured will often make for an angry, bitter person. Weaver has played fierce heroines, but in Death and the Maiden she is physically and psychically scarred -- a desperate woman. Before we know anything about her, we're treated to a very Polanski-esque shot of her cutting into a chicken she has made for dinner. Some  thing about her aggressive attack on that poor chicken is just a little too personal for comfort. Death and the Maiden, which takes its title from a Schubert string quartet, forces the audience to confront questions about torture and punishment. Paulina, whose humanity has been assaulted, has withstood the ultimate misfortune of being degraded in her own eyes. But even in those moments when we suspect she may be right about Miranda, there can be no pleasure in watching her similarly torture him. In the scheme of Death and the Maiden, degradation is the one thing no one ever deserves. To play degradation, the actors here have to get down in the mud and wrestle. They do. Weaver, for all her ferocity, has never been as vulnerable, and Kingsley plays an amiable fellow in a state of complete humiliation. The mystery aspect of the picture prevents me from going into specifics -- except to say Kingsley has simply transcendent moments. Almost lost between the two more dramatic characters, yet every bit the equal of Weaver or Kingsley, is Wilson, who as Escobar comes closest to embodying the point of view of the audience. He is nervous, has no idea what's true, and is afraid of what might happen next. Polanski directs the film without a wasting a moment. The occasional humor does nothing to relieve tension but, as in a Hitchcock picture, has a way of increasing it. ",1
"The Manson Family True crime/horror. Starring Marcelo Games, Marc Pitman, Leslie Orr and Maureen Allisse. Directed by Jim Van Bebber. (Not rated. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is a hard, ugly, nasty film, an unrated feature that, if rated, would be NC-17 many times over. The acting is at times amateurish, and the movie contains an unfortunate modern-day subplot that turns downright ludicrous. Yet, all in all, Van Bebber has delivered a stylistically vigorous and often insightful piece of work. He avoids the usual traps. He doesnt tell the story as though it were inevitable. And he doesnt tell the story as if Manson, from day one, were sitting around with a master plan to turn people evil. Instead, Van Bebber presents the Manson family as a mutant strain of the 60s youth movement, the perverse but logical product of endemic solipsism, insularity, grandiosity, muddled mysticism and drugs, drugs, drugs. And for a while, their world looks kind of fun. That is to say, at least with the Manson family, youd never have to worry about getting a date. We see them: young, outdoors and having sex constantly. They have no need to punch a clock, no need even to wear clothes. Its all fun and games, lots of talk, lots of big plans, but with no one feeling any immediate need to get up and do something. Its like what people want from Club Med, only without the nightclubs. Idylls are often destroyed by a need for the outside world. That need is manifested in the groups lack of money and in Mansons dream of becoming a rock star. That dream dies hard, leaving an even more pressing need for money. Since it would be unthinkable for any of these people to put on a shirt and go to work, the need for money leads to crime. Compounding these usual factors are more dangerous influences. Theyre on hallucinogens and have a slippery sense of reality. And theyre also on crystal meth, so theyre aggressive. Theyre led by a man whos evil and whom they believe to be Jesus Christ, a perennially lethal combination. And theyre living in an era when its just understood that youth means wisdom and anger is evidence of righteousness. Van Bebber juggles several storytelling modes, interspersing modern-day mock interviews, grainy fake-documentary footage supposedly from the early 1970s, flashbacks and straight narrative. He often shoots from the perspective of characters in heightened circumstances. Sometimes this approach is showy and annoying, and sometimes it gets under the skin. He uses the victims perspective in a gang-rape sequence to chilling effect. The Tate-LaBianca murders are portrayed in terms of a cheap exploitation movie, with lots of bad acting and buckets of blood, but something in the mundane nature of the presentation makes it all seem real. But beware: This is not for the squeamish. ?Advisory: Many simulated sex acts, frequent frontal nudity, strong language, constant drug use and gruesome, shocking violence.  Mick LaSalle Documentary. Produced by Eric Manes, Archie Drury and Martin Kunert. (Not rated. 80 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) Do the producers of this film have an agenda to show a more positive side of Iraq? Do they want to give evidence that the U.S.-led war in Iraq, despite the abuses at Abu Ghraib and the deaths of Iraqi civilians, is at least preferable to the reign of Saddam Hussein? These questions are open to debate, but one thing is clear: Voices of Iraq shows Iraqi society in all its complexity  one of the first times that a theatrically released documentary has ever done that. For this reason alone, Voices of Iraq is a must-see for anyone still coming to terms with the chaos in Iraq. Nearly all the footage was taken by Iraqis who were handed video equipment, and nearly all the footage was taken within the past six months. The project happened when three U.S. producers (including one who created MTVs Fear reality series) gave 150 digital video cameras to everyday people who live in Baghdad, Kirkuk and other Iraqi cities. More than 1,500 Iraqis took videos of their lives. We see a childrens birthday party where adults and youngsters are happily celebrating. We see students at Baghdad University rushing off to classes, flirting, talking about their future. We see a young man in a rock band playing drums and rapping. But we also see the aftermath of car bombings, we hear Iraqis say their country is less safe than it was under Hussein, and we meet a young girl named Farah who was shot in the arm and stomach by U.S. soldiers. Voices of Iraq has conflicting viewpoints  which is one of its strengths. Tucked into the film are videos, apparently made by Iraqi insurgents, who urge Arabs to attack U.S. soldiers. These are juxtaposed with video, apparently made by Husseins son Uday, that show extreme torture of Iraqi prisoners. Some Iraqis claim that the Abu Ghraib prison abuse was tame compared with what they endured under Hussein. There are certainly indications that Voices of Iraq is an attempt to counteract Fahrenheit 9/11 and other anti-war documentaries. The movies Web site names the production company as Voices of Freedom, LLC. The conservative Washington Times newspaper has written that the film is a potent negation of anti-war views held by Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky. The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial pages lean right, has opined that Voices of Iraq overwhelmingly (shows) signs of life and optimism in Iraq. In an interview with The Chronicle, Archie Drury, one of the films three producers, acknowledges that the film makes Bush look good and that the producers selectively edited the Iraqis footage  but says the films main point is to humanize the Iraqi people. Drury is a Democrat. As a Marine, he served in the first Persian Gulf war, where he got to know Iraqi children who walked up to his observation post. Anyone who has met Iraqis  whether its in Baghdad or Berkeley  knows theyre more than the images that air on the nightly news. Voices of Iraq gives us this more nuanced picture. Its more upbeat than not, more hopeful than not. In a world where people often see things as either half full or half empty, this is a film thats half full. Its an approach that even the wars harshest critics should find interesting. Advisory: This film has occasional rough language, scenes of people with bullet scars and extremely disturbing footage of prisoner torture.  Jonathan Curiel Romantic comedy. Starring Andy Lau, Sammi Cheng. Directed by Johnnie To. (Not rated. 100 minutes. At the 4 Star.) Yesterday Once More is on track to become one of the biggest hits of 2004 at the Hong Kong and Chinese box office, having been the No.?1 movie since opening there Oct. 14. That is a testament to the sparkling star power of Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng and the slick capabilities of director Johnnie To rather than to the quality of the film, which harks back to 1960s romantic caper films like The Thomas Crown Affair and How to Steal a Million. Make no mistake, this is a watchable and often enjoyable piece of fluff, with engaging characters, entertaining double crosses and a cornucopia of expensive trappings: Lamborghinis, yachts, fine clothes and fine wine. But considering the pedigree of the principals, its a bit of a letdown  like some of the stolen jewelry in the film, its more of an imitation than the genuine article. Lau, Cheng and To have collaborated twice before, each leading to box office gold. Needing You (2000) was a sharply scripted office comedy that made Cheng a superstar and To much more than just an action director. Love on a Diet (2001) put Lau and Cheng in 300-pound fat suits, a situation that could have been an embarrassment; instead, its one of the sweetest comic love stories in recent memory. In Yesterday Once More, Lau and Cheng, as divorced jewel thieves competing to steal a valuable necklace that is the family heirloom of Chengs suitor (Carl Ng), still have the chemistry, but seem to take it for granted. To, who is Hong Kongs best genre director, again displays a great instinct for showmanship (dig the cool opening credits sequence and catchy jazz score), smooth editing and that one last unexpected plot twist, but it all seems a bit off this time, thanks to a script that gets lost in its own make-it-up-as-you-go plot. Why, for example, do our heroes turn up in Italy for a brief few minutes? Apparently, just to relax at an outdoor cafe and have espressos. Lau and Cheng have better days ahead at the American box office in the next couple of months  both are in Infernal Affairs, an excellent police drama that is being remade by Martin Scorsese, and Lau is in the magical House of Flying Daggers for Hero director Zhang Yimou. Yesterday Once More, which has nothing to do with the Carpenters song of the same title, is merely a quick fix for their fans.  G. Allen Johnson ",1
"À Tout de Suite: Drama. Starring Isild Le Besco and Ouassini Embarek. Directed by Benoît Jacquot. (Unrated. 96 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) The beauty of À Tout de Suite -- aside from its being quite beautiful to look at, shot in a nostalgic black and white -- is that it's neither romantic nor cynical. At all points in the story, you are aware of how our heroine, Lili (Isild Le Besco), sees her situation and also of how we see it. Where she sees romance, we see tawdriness. Where she sees adventure, we see turmoil. We know that, if we were 19, we'd probably see things her way. Most movies evoke the romance of youth, but À Tout de Suite gives us the whole picture: youth's splendor but also its ugliness, powerlessness and confusion. The emotional journey is told largely through close-ups of Le Besco, an actress blessed with a face worthy of contemplation. She can look very pretty and very ordinary by turns, and there's a maturity about her essence -- or her thoughts, as expressed through her face -- that makes her interesting. It's the same quality Scarlett Johansson has, except in Le Besco's case it's not spoiled by misbegotten vanity. Moreover, she's a real talent, who does something remarkable in À Tout de Suite, conveying the sense of a highly developed consciousness in embryo, a thinking person who hasn't yet learned the value of reason. It's 1975, and Lili is an art student from a middle-class family. She goes to a bar and falls in love with Bada (Ouassini Embarek), a naive Moroccan boy, in the way that people fall in love at that age. They look at each other and understand all, because at that age everything's on the surface. Within a few days she can't live without him, and so she's rather distressed when she finds out that he and his buddies have tried to rob a bank. A cashier is dead, and Bada is a fugitive. The rest of the movie traces Lili's odyssey. Bada, his criminal partner, his partner's girlfriend and Lili hit the road. Their only chance is leaving the country. À Tout de Suite becomes a detailed travelogue that follows a fascinating geographical and psychological trajectory. Lili's romantic delusion comes up against Bada's very real and well-earned case of adult guilt. The consequences are dire. At the same time, these folks are young and more or less on vacation. The cell door might shut at any moment, but in the meantime they're more free than they've ever been. The irony is that the freedom they're tasting is not something that had to be stolen. It would have been available to them in the natural course of things. They're not reveling in anything but unfettered adulthood. In one memorable scene, Lili dances in a nightclub to Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To), the Diana Ross song that was a hit at the time. Lili has her eyes closed, and you can feel the psychic will with which she's trying to make life give way to her romantic misinterpretation of it. It's a doomed effort, and sad to see, because we've all been through it -- the young adult equivalent of losing Santa Claus. That's the sobering moment when one realizes that sex can't cure everything. -- Advisory: Simulated sex, full frontal nudity (male and female), mild violence. ",1
" BROKEN ARROW: Action. Starring John Travolta and Christian Slater. Directed by John Woo. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Unlike Woo's first American effort, Hard Target, Broken Arrow, which opens today, is a plain, straight- ahead action film without any interludes of ponderous, slow-motion sadism. The best aspects of Woo's style mark it as his film: the inspired camera work, beautifully choreographed action, and the unexpected moments of reflection in the most tense of scenes. In an early scene, Christian Slater, playing a bomber pilot, observes that it isn't flying that fellow pilot John Travolta enjoys so much as the God- like feeling of riding around with nuclear missiles onboard. Woo's camera zooms right up to Travolta's eyes as the truth of that remark sets in. Travolta plays Deakins, an Air Force major who reacts in a somewhat extreme way to being passed over for promotion: He steals a couple of nuclear missiles, with the idea of ransoming them to the tune of $250 million. Then I'll buy 5 percent of Volvo, he says, and have the comfort of knowing I'm helping to make one of the safest automobiles in the world. The inspired casting of Travolta as the off-his-rocker nuclear terrorist kicks Broken Arrow into another level. Instead of a sleazy Henry Silva- like bad guy or a snide English villain that you can't wait to see get killed, it's Big John up there. Dimply, blue-eyed, smiling John. Travolta plays Deakins as a guy who thinks he's in this for the goof of it. He wants to make the government honchos squirm. He wants to see what happens when you detonate a nuclear bomb in the desert. He makes jokes, deliberately talks in a weird half- Southern accent, but he's really just trying to distract himself from what is clear to the audience: Beneath the surface, this is one sick puppy. Travolta is much more charismatic than good-guy Slater, but that seems right. When Slater, as Air Force Captain Hale, goes up against the evil Deakins, he's not just facing superior fire power. He's facing a more impressive fellow, someone psychologically hard to fight, someone it's hard not to like. This is the lineup: On the side of humanity it's young Captain Hale on foot in the desert, teamed up with a lady park ranger, played by Samantha Mathis. On the side of chaos it's Deakins and a gang of terrorists, riding in trucks and helicopters, armed with machine guns and, of course, two nuclear missiles. Roughly, an even match. Woo deserves credit for keeping the picture moving at a relentless enough pace. But the credit has to be shared with screenwriter Graham Yost, who wrote Speed. The incidents keep escalating in Broken Arrow to the point where they can detonate a nuclear bomb halfway through the picture and still top it at the finish. Woo is in control of Broken Arrow from the first shot. Two particles are shown moving against a white background, in what looks to be a shot of single- cell organisms on a microscope slide. But as the camera moves in, you realize you're watching an overhead shot of two men boxing in a ring -- Slater and Travolta, pummeling each other. The impulse to destroy seems like the natural order of things, especially when seen from a distance. There are lapses in character motivation, and at times the film takes on a cartoony feeling. But if you worry about those things, you shouldn't be watching action movies. For its genre, Broken Arrow is a class act. By the way, fans of old Westerns should be warned. This is not a remake of the 1950 western Broken Arrow, with Jeff Chandler as Cochise. Broken Arrow is supposedly the military term for a missing nuclear weapon. After this movie becomes popular they might just as well go ahead and call it missing nuclear weapon. ",1
" DISCLOSURE: Thriller. Starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. Directed by Barry Levinson. (R. 110 minutes.) Unlike the other villainesses, Moore in Disclosure, now available on home video, is not mentally unbalanced. Far from it. She is cool, in control -- and utterly amoral. She's willing to do anything to win, and she's too smart to lose. She's cruel, without weakness, and to make matters worse, she is very pretty. She is, in short, the male nightmare. Here we have the first major film about sexual harassment, and what do you know? It's about a woman harassing a man. Of course when woman bites dog, that's news. But even aside from that, the folks who hissed at the film upon its release might take solace in the fact that if ever a movie could put over the unfairness of sexual harassment in a way that men could appreciate, it's Disclosure. It's the film that asks, and attempts to answer, the question, How would you like it? Along the way it paints a picture of corporate America that in itself is a kind of horror story. In Disclosure, life in the working world is like walking through a vicious, maze-like funhouse, where  the laughter is mirthless, the truth is distorted and backstabbers pop out from every corner. Douglas plays Tom, a nice family man who, at the start of the film, trundles off to his high-tech computer job one morning expecting to get a fat promotion. Fat chance. In a beautifully directed scene early in the picture, Tom goes to his boss' office and finds a former girlfriend, Meredith (Moore), sitting there, breezily trading in-jokes with the head man, both of them talking over poor Tom's head. Our hero is off balance from the beginning of Disclosure, and off balance he remains. Even before Meredith becomes Tom's boss and tries to seduce him, the film is unsettling. From there things accelerate. She accuses him of sexual harassment, and he accuses her back. Look at her, look at him. Whom would you believe? Disclosure is a frankly adult picture. The seduction scene is protracted and genuinely sexy -- though what this woman sees in Douglas is a mystery. The talk in Disclosure is also frank -- and unusually explicit. People talk about sex in this picture as they would in life. Though most movie stars insist on playing only sympathetic roles, even when they're playing villains, Moore goes out on a limb here. She plays a woman who, however hu man, is truly hard, and she plays it well. As the poor shlub fighting several battles at once -- all of them against shrewder, meaner adversaries -- Douglas is a complex and sympathetic Everyman. ",1
" LIVING IN OBLIVION: Comedy-drama. Starring Steve Buscemi, Catherine Keener and James Le Gros. Directed by Tom DiCillo. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Written and directed by Tom DiCillo, this is a very funny picture that presents the world of independent film making as a nightmare of conflicting egos, budgetary squalor and incompetence. The picture, which opens today, gives you a firsthand look at how films are made. In the first minutes, a director (Steve Buscemi) is trying to film a mother- daughter scene in a single take. On each attempt there's a mechanical problem that interrupts filming, until gradually, the actors begin to lose it. Catherine Keener plays Nicole, the actress in the film-within-a-film, and she does a brilliant job of showing us the gradual disintegration of an actress' performance from take to take. The changes are subtle. At a certain point she seems to be phoning in. Later she's unraveling altogether. It's a fascinating thing to watch. Still later, Nicole does the scene perfectly, and you're surprised that these banal lines could support so much sincere feeling. Living in Oblivion is one of three films released this week (the two others are Unzipped and My Life and Times With Antonin Artaud) that use grainy, high-contrast, black-and-white sequences. In the first segment of the picture, DiCillo shoots the crew scenes in black and white and the movie-within-the-movie in color. In the second segment, in which James Le Gros appears as a spoiled Hollywood heart  throb, DiCillo reverses it -- color for the crew scenes, black and white for the movie-within-the-movie. Le Gros' performance as Chad Palomino is bound to be the most talked about element of Living in Oblivion. Shaking his long, light brown hair from his face and fixing a blank stare at the script girl, Le Gros is clearly doing a send-up of Brad Pitt -- a send-up so obvious that you don't need to remember that Pitt was the star of DiCillo's Johnny Suede. This is as withering and eviscerating a mockery of a living actor as you'll ever see. Chad is presented as a narcissistic dunce with a hygiene problem, who can't stop making ridiculous suggestions -- usually designed to put himself in a close-up. He leaps in and out of the frame and comes up with absurd bits of business, such as sprawling across a bed for no reason or aggressively playing with his leading lady's hair. Le Gros is a scream, and Buscemi is likable, intense and explosive. His on-the- set crack-up, in which he tells off every member of the cast and crew, is a highlight. But he also wonders, in a quieter moment, whether maybe I should just get a job teaching Spanish in a women's college somewhere. As an actress terrified that if she doesn't make good she'll have to go back to waitressing, Keener is the one who stays with you. She gives this very sharp movie a soul. ",1
"'Time Out'  Drama. Starring Aurelien Recoing and Karin Viard. Directed By Laurent Cantet. (PG-13. 132 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Human Resources was a good, straightforward tale, but Time Out is better. It's haunting. It's like a poem. Vincent (Aurelien Recoing) becomes a con artist, fleecing friends and acquaintances in order to maintain the fantasy and bring home money to his family. The picture offers an arresting portrait of a fellow flying free and yet spiraling downward, but the story is bigger than just that. It's about modern men and the ways they try to maintain self-esteem in a business climate that's increasingly arcane, monolithic and impersonal. Time Out is wonderful in its bleakness. As Vincent, Recoing, a French stage actor in his first major movie riole, is the picture of the middle-aged dad with the briefcase, the trench coat and the cell phone. He is constantly on the road. He finds solitude in the interior of his car, in hotel rooms or abandoned houses, but there's never any getting away from the sound of the highway in the distance. It's always present, like breathing. Cantet has said of his film that when Vincent pretends to be a U.N. consultant, we're seeing him at his most alive. But nothing in the movie makes us identify the U.N. position as all that better than any other job. Indeed, the sad and affecting thing about Vincent's fantasy is just how un-fantastic it is. He talks about expanding markets and market research, and it all sounds substanceless and oppressive. Is this what men were meant to be doing? Advisory: This film contains sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Documentary. Directed by Bruce Hendricks. (PG. 39 minutes. At the Loews Metreon IMAX Theater.) Abetter title for this film would be Penultimate X. Instead of a full- length documentary about ESPN's wildly popular Summer X Games, we get a brief overview that's not much longer than a late-night infomercial. (Thirty-nine minutes? Name another major release that's just 39 minutes.) Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games, we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized. And yet Ultimate X deserves praise for capturing on film -- with incredible angles and camera shots -- the leaps, spills, crowds, tension and craziness that define the X Games, which have become as important to American youth as MTV and Harry Potter. True, scores of adults are attracted every year to the X Games venues, where bikers, skateboarders, in-line skaters, motorcyclists and other competitors zip and zoom into the air, over dirt and around walls and corners. And it's true that some of the X Games athletes are in their 20s and even 30s. But as one of them says in Ultimate X, it's the younger competitors who are the X Games' focus because they always push the boundaries of what is possible. It's younger people who will love this brief movie and thrill to the loud music that accompanies every flip, crash and successful landing by such X Games stars as Travis Pastrana, Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Carey Hart, Cory Nasty Nastazio and T.J. Lavin. All of these stars are legends to their fans, one of whom is quoted as saying, Tony Hawk is God. He isn't, but this movie doesn't have time to explain everything. -- Jonathan Curiel Black comedy. Starring Marie-Josee Croze and Jean-Nicolas Verreault. Directed by Denis Villeneuve. (Not rated. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Maelstrom is a compelling parable from Canada that's open to a number of interpretations. On the surface, it's a black comedy that says the usual things about fate being perverse and life being meaningless. But go a layer deeper and Maelstrom is all about the consequences of irresponsibility, a movie that hides a very moral, focused point of view behind a veneer of what- the-hell hipness. The film is narrated by a fish about to go to market. Within minutes, his head is going to be chopped off, a choice not merely fey or comic. In this sly, intelligent film, everything is there for a reason. Writer-director Denis Villeneuve has sympathy even for the fish on a butcher's block. His film is pro-life in the most sophisticated way. We first meet our heroine, Bibiane (Marie-Josee Croze), as she's in the process of getting an abortion. The 25-year-old owner of several high-end fashion shops in Montreal, she suffers several business reversals, consoles herself by getting drunk -- and kills a man in a drunken-driving accident on her way home from a dance club. The rest of the movie is about how Bibiane deals with the death and attempts to give her life a makeover. Yet to say only that makes Maelstrom sound like a dramatic tale of moral regeneration. In fact, the tone is light, funny and fantastic, not unlike that of, say, Amelie. For Villeneuve, the consequences of irresponsibility may be death, but he doesn't presume to prescribe rules, nor does he shy away from absurdity. Maelstrom accepts and lingers on the rich coincidences and ironies of life as it's actually lived. Villeneuve's affection extends to all the characters but particularly Bibiane who, in another writer's hands and with a less charming actress playing her, could easily have been unsympathetic: a beautiful little rich girl, whose father gave her everything. But did he? According to Villeneuve, there are lessons everyone has to learn. Maelstrom is an original little film about one young woman's education. Advisory: This film contains nudity, sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle Comedy. Starring DJ Qualls, Eliza Dushku. Directed by Ed Decter. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) You can tell when the makers of The New Guy get desperate. It's when they plop Eliza Dushku on a mechanical bull or show a montage of her trying on bikinis. In this lame, haphazard teen comedy, the dark-eyed sexpot from Bring It On is the only sure thing. The most outrageous act required of Dushku, however, is having to kiss DJ Qualls, who plays a high school geek transformed into a stud. Qualls was fabulous as the goofball virgin in Road Trip, but he was a novelty act in that movie, not the star. He has to carry The New Guy, which is almost unfair. A string bean with a giraffe neck and sad smile, he's so physically awkward that watching him strut is unsettling instead of funny. He also looks too old for the role. It doesn't help that he's stuck at Cliche High. His character, who pines for a cheerleader and is bullied by her jock boyfriend, gets himself expelled so he can switch schools and pursue another cheerleader (Dushku) with a jock boyfriend. Wouldn't it be refreshing if just once, a cinematic high school goober chased a girl his speed? Before he makes it to the new school, Qualls lands in the pen with Eddie Griffin. The crime of defacing school property probably wouldn't get him prison time, but let's not quibble, since Griffin offers the film's only signs of life. He bites into the role of a nutty con who teaches Qualls to act tough, which mostly entails mad-dog stares and the repeated lighting of a Zippo. Qualls is in prison, then he's in high school, then back in prison, without any explanation. The New Guy, apparently, is following the new school of film comedy established by The Sweetest Thing in which continuity is discarded for random gags. The mechanical-bull interlude comes out of nowhere, as do visual references to Braveheart and even the modest teen comedy Can't Hardly Wait. These tired elements highlight the lack of imagination of director Ed Decter and writer David Kendall. Lyle Lovett and Illeana Douglas appear as Qualls' father and guidance counselor, and they share the quality of having checked out. Lovett continues to be a wonderful singer and a terrible actor, and Douglas' touchy-feely act is a pale imitation of her art teacher in the vastly superior teen comedy Ghost World. Maybe Lovett and Douglas just wanted to hang out with Tommy Lee, Vanilla Ice, Henry Rollins and skateboarder Tony Hawk, all of whom make cameos. The movie might be a dud, but the set probably was a hoot. Advisory: This film contains vulgar humor. -- Carla Meyer Drama. Starring Kris Kristofferson, Robert Sean Leonard, Natasha Richardson and Uma Thurman. Directed by Ethan Hawke. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With most movies that fail, the fault can be ascribed to carelessness or lack or inspiration or cynicism. But Chelsea Walls, directed by actor Ethan Hawke, is clearly a labor of love. His camera pans up and down the faces of his actors as though he wants to kiss them or at least touch them gently with the backs of his fingers. There's no question he's happy to be filming them and happy to be shooting in the historic Chelsea Hotel, and yet none of that translates into a movie that's worth watching. In fact, some of that enthusiasm translates into scenes that are torture to sit through. Chelsea Walls is hampered -- no, paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script (adapted by Nicole Burdette from her own play) that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire: I want to put my power into a poem to burn a hole in your pocket so I can sew it, one woman says. She ought to leave the guy's pants alone. The narrative is nonexistent. Instead we get a series of little scenes involving various characters in various rooms. Hawke tries to capture the flavor of the hotel, which has attracted artists since early in the past century. He succeeds in making the hotel seem like the most boring place on earth. Hawke has brought together a talented cast, including Vincent D'Onofrio, Robert Sean Leonard, Kris Kristofferson, Uma Thurman (Hawke's wife) and Steve Zahn. The actors are game, but invariably the scenes trail off into ambiguity and irresolution. Nothing happens. Frank Whalley plays a lounge singer. He introduces a song, but the scene ends before he sings it. That's typical. The other typical thing is for scenes to play long past their natural life. Advisory: This film contains strong language. -- Mick LaSalle ",1
